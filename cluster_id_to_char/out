0 :  no wonder newspapers are dying

1 :  but thats not the question

2 :  who they were we really have no idea were not even sure where they lived and who they

3 :  thats not my job

4 :  it is after all hard to understand something you cant put into words

5 :  theyre part of the same social mechanism

6 :  thats one of the archaic dual forms

7 :  the exposures are long

8 :  though these images look historical they are actually contemporary

9 :  history is not merely the past

10 :  to reminisce and to imagine themselves back in time

11 :  fortunately its not that way everywhere in japan

12 :  we can find examples of this in almost every aspect of japanese culture

13 :  thats what a good concert still does today

14 :  i think many of you may know what im talking about

15 :  we must imagine or learn where we are going and meanwhile we must be fully

16 :  old buildings storing rich memories are being destroyed

17 :  i hope ive helped you to appreciate that

18 :  a recent report by the pew center on trends in america indicates that

19 :  you with your shiny skin and your bike youre angry at me

20 :  quite the contrary

21 :  and this makes sense of course right

22 :  you can listen to a podcast about what its like to grow up dalit in kolkata

23 :  which is a wonderful experience to have

24 :  the space between things

25 :  we create lives for ourselves that are domestic

26 :  and perhaps more so than any other project of ours where this has a special meaning is our reconstruction

27 :  we tried to understand that better

28 :  one of the things that is interesting is that human beings actually respond in a very positive

29 :  so overview of the spaces along broadway here with 7th avenue still having traffic

30 :  these are solid granite curbs that will go in on the corners of the streets

31 :  and i thought to myself its great in this moment when i recognize that he put value in

32 :  its a great team working out there

33 :  were micro grading areas to remove the drainage problem

34 :  because everyones in the same boat

35 :  whereas if you ask someone from nebraska they think its the most amazing thing on earth

36 :  i thought it was kind of fun

37 :  so i found a little fruit stand on the side of the road

38 :  and nobody really noticed it because most everyone thinks of it as it is flat

39 :  and thats where the rain water puddles actually appear

40 :  but we wanted to reflect that light into the ground

41 :  theyre being laid now and in a beautiful way

42 :  theyre working through the winter through the cold weather to make sure that it happens quickly

43 :  and they dont have anything to allow them to feel safe or comfortable

44 :  i thought to myself if you replaced the word cow with the word human it still makes perfect sense

45 :  of course were seeing all kinds of odd things

46 :  once we went out to time square and we stood at one end and we looked across time square from one end to the other

47 :  were actually increasing the speed of traffic because were removing traffic lights from time square

48 :  a number of years ago i was in china

49 :  and we move in many ways like livestock

50 :  i always laughed whenever i read a temple grandin book

51 :  which is also important

52 :  and we thought to do that at time square

53 :  we then thought to ourselves how are we going to solve this problem

54 :  theres a wonderful these are daylight sunlight studies we made of time square

55 :  we hate to admit it because we think were above all that

56 :  so why is it that those two places are so different

57 :  and what if

58 :  or how does the computer know what happens when i press play how does it know which video to

59 :  little girls are amazing

60 :  you had to go to class

61 :  a metallic toilet against the back right one of those mattresses you practice sit ups on

62 :  then you sell a lot more

63 :  even in sales

64 :  let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice

65 :  they did not make it to university

66 :  and i realized its all about heteronormative space

67 :  there i was a nineteen year old on the search for a live affirming queer theory that brought gay and

68 :  i met amanda lepore i went to the box i saw clubbing and saw these genderfucked club kids and my eyes

69 :  all of them create barriers between people rather than unifying us

70 :  so at first i was like thats completely ridiculous

71 :  dreams fall into a rare category of subjects that are both non confrontational and interesting

72 :  and it creates an incoherent story line im sure many of you are familiar with

73 :  that was a mess

74 :  politics and economic issues and social issues

75 :  therell be an immediate reaction you know people saying oh what was it

76 :  and she pulled me over and i said what it is

77 :  i need to order this

78 :  so on the subject of everything being connected i would encourage all of you to go out and put more emphasis on your dreams

79 :  plato said that if you pay attention to your dreams they can actually give you information about how to behave in your own

80 :  think about them write them down talk about them with people

81 :  im now in my forties

82 :  my parents gamble has paid off

83 :  as a result im not wired to be content with the status quo

84 :  i have no context for it

85 :  he wants us out of the country

86 :  more than once i stare down the barrel of a semi automatic weapon with the sweaty trigger finger

87 :  but i show up anyway

88 :  i live in exile

89 :  let your children experience some of the hardships of everyday life so they can get to know their most

90 :  schools have been closed and they wont reopen

91 :  i would do this

92 :  i hope that one day people will see me more the way i see myself that i didnt achieve this as a

93 :  that is a really important part of how i think about myself

94 :  its something that made me think oh i should get a masters degree in engineering even though i had been an art

95 :  all i was expected to do was follow the rules and play to win

96 :  in a winning on a game show isnt a huge deal in the grant scheme of things but

97 :  thats what i think is important about my part in the conversation

98 :  they bring in about a dozen people to play

99 :  but its also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up where people cant use

100 :  and thats the world i really want to live in

101 :  i was there

102 :  we think we already know how something works so we cant imagine how it could work

103 :  i ran these workshops everywhere

104 :  how did they make them

105 :  and in fact it has created us has created life has created all the stuff of life

106 :  so i think we need to put a hold on this but there are many people who not only disagree with me

107 :  to me as a scientist thats fantastic but again at the same time it opens the door

108 :  we have to ban this

109 :  no no lets be honest

110 :  but some of you might be more into npr than science lg

111 :  what was even scarier at least to me was that the least competent people were the

112 :  so the best marathon runners dont actually show physical differences whats different is how much they

113 :  so what do you think

114 :  but a client of mine recently explained what i do far better than i ever could

115 :  so i confidently state

116 :  they said he was as smart as they come

117 :  so for me in my work coaching leaders im often sent in to tell someone the truth

118 :  heres my advice

119 :  in a very short period they started talking about this wonderful guy who they called the

120 :  its that thing youve been dying to master

121 :  on and on it went one thing at a time for months

122 :  when was the last time you had no idea what you were doing

123 :  in a very short time he felt a new level of confidence

124 :  but the best ted talkers will never break

125 :  thats a favorite

126 :  i only got three minutes to prepare this so dont be all smug when i make a mistake

127 :  what can i get ya

128 :  sure i was different but that didnt matter anymore

129 :  i spent most of my days bedridden

130 :  one you can wallow in your own despair like some angst filled shakespearean character

131 :  midnight can create a sense of unfriendliness to all around you

132 :  for all i could care the old me died in that hospital

133 :  i was basically a regular at my local doctors office

134 :  i remember all the countless angry stares id get as my coughing would interrupt them while they were taking a quiz

135 :  if there was a competition for being unlucky wed unfortunately lose in the last few seconds because something lucky happened taking us out of

136 :  youre going to bed at ten p

137 :  just a few months in and i was as bad as i had ever been

138 :  but that was not the case

139 :  silly me right

140 :  i had lived in darkness for so long that my mind began to warp its own surroundings

141 :  i was soon missing school weeks at a time

142 :  keeping all your feelings pent up like that is a recipe for disaster

143 :  you feel overwhelmed as life becomes too daunting a task to take on and the world doesnt seem like that great inviting place it used

144 :  need help crying

145 :  i was like a celebrity

146 :  and more importantly i wasnt going to intentionally put myself down because i didnt feel good enough

147 :  and to those who lock themselves in their room denying that things will ever change the dawn will never come and they were meant to live in

148 :  youre so handsome and a constant source of inspiration but how am i supposed to feel happy when everything around me feels so

149 :  you lost your job

150 :  i could tell you the various tubes they had shoved in my body or the time my lung collapsed

151 :  everyone there knew me by name

152 :  i was known to pretty much everyone as the kid who coughed all the time

153 :  i was just trying to live my life

154 :  what was just a branch tapping on the window now seems like a terrible monster trying to get in

155 :  i know what youre thinking you

156 :  i could also tell you about all the countless patients all fighting their own unique battles just as i was fighting my own

157 :  i could tell you about the courage and optimism they showed one i wished i could emulate

158 :  i was born anew and given a second chance and this time i was going to take life by the reins and actually do something

159 :  entering my first year of high school my lungs had me on the ropes

160 :  one day i made the very stupid decision to try and go out and run and have a good time

161 :  within minutes i was on the ground unable to breathe

162 :  i could tell you the many times i thought about finding a way to end it right then and there

163 :  thats how you think when in that state

164 :  that life can sometimes suck

165 :  i know all your kids back home are probably thinking free vacation

166 :  how are we going to get unsad

167 :  but anyways this was bad really bad like finding out your favorite tv show was canceled bad

168 :  now its the flu

169 :  it is silent

170 :  what started off as what seemed to be a bad case of asthma soon grew into something much worse

171 :  to show you this i would like to share with you my own story

172 :  i know it can be hard sometimes but if you really dig deep enough you can find a bright side

173 :  how are we going to fix this

174 :  no of course not because your life is terrible

175 :  the once cool and calming breeze now howls against your eardrums

176 :  fourth dont you dare think that the answer is going to be found in some pill or at the bottom of a bottle unless

177 :  but the question is

178 :  i think thats probably a word dont worry about it

179 :  oh no you got pneumonia

180 :  or the second time

181 :  with my newfound spirit i discovered a passion for theater and a love for the stage

182 :  take a cooking class or something

183 :  come for the fun stay for the food am i right

184 :  i was only in this world for a few minutes and id already met my greatest enemy

185 :  and years after i left covenant house he was still working there

186 :  what is a gopro

187 :  we dont climb higher

188 :  find your own concrete ways to carry across our many cultures

189 :  we dont fly or swim better

190 :  spoken languages though can create barriers between cultures

191 :  its a common ground upon which we can plant complex yet balanced conversations

192 :  they often prevent you from learning about and relating to all the fascinating things

193 :  we are able to do this no matter what our cultural background is

194 :  its to allow the whole world to enter our kitchen

195 :  and till today when i am hungry i dont have michelin stars fantasies about

196 :  when im hungry im thinking

197 :  so for me the sentence we are what we eat is a very literal one

198 :  i will never forget it

199 :  of course we can only gain these things trough individual hard work

200 :  we all now that entering the job market is challenging

201 :  the vast majority of us prisoners will be released at some point

202 :  five million people were released from prison in the united states

203 :  according to the pew center on the states two thousand and eleven report nearly fortyfive of people

204 :  i was out walking the track the other day and i overheard a fellow prisoner telling his friend how this is his sixth time in

205 :  i was determined to win the second

206 :  the pdc effect had won that first round

207 :  thats some powerful food for thought

208 :  one that has an academic pathway that offers degrees

209 :  nor is it so different from the situation that hundreds of thousands of others find themselves in

210 :  university beyond bars has made a great start with an incredible idea

211 :  a four year college degree from the university of washington costs almost the same as one year of

212 :  but the biggest thing that we need is your support

213 :  and they are not the only ones

214 :  we talk about the brain but of course every brain is slightly different and maybe there are some individuals or some

215 :  china and japan have an even longer history of rivalry and have been deploying their air forces and navies to show their

216 :  we have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis but have we invested them

217 :  now lets stop and think about it for a minute

218 :  that is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations that we have

219 :  it tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor that small countries cannot escape

220 :  this is a fuel injection nozzle for the new generation of ge jet engines

221 :  its always been used as a prototyping tool but its a lot more than that

222 :  theyre all 3d printed now

223 :  and that is your opportunity

224 :  so join me on this journey briefly as an inspiration for how you may be able to engage

225 :  3d printers you can buy for two hundred or three hundred dollars now to make prototypes

226 :  so weve moved from a prototyping tool to a customization tool and now were moving to a manufacturing tool

227 :  but more than that even

228 :  weve heard about driverless cars

229 :  three hundred thousand phone lines for then about one hundred and fiftyfive million people

230 :  its the plane crash in nigeria when i lived there in two thousand and twelve
231 :  people like you

232 :  ten of everything is one
233 :  there are dozens and dozens of more

234 :  they had to take the part back to america they had to reverse engineer it and then install it

235 :  if were sending a digital design across borders will tax it the same way

236 :  every time we engage with a new client the steps multiply and there are hundreds on steps in this value chain

237 :  so im just giving you a thirty thousand feet view

238 :  you have to put these three elements together

239 :  you have that mostly because of the people that live here

240 :  so charge parity transforms a matter world into an antimatter

241 :  for this you need to recall that whenever matter antimatter meet they get turned into pure light

242 :  so let us entertain the idea for a while that antimatter behave so unexpectedly as to fall

243 :  in the early nineteen thirties a whole new component of matter was found which in some cells behave

244 :  most likely we will find that matter and antimatter fall in exactly the same way in

245 :  we can do so thanks to the help of a machine called the antiproton decelerator

246 :  but in fact we believe that fundamental building blocks of nature have no size at

247 :  i went to southern africa

248 :  but of course my lazy perfectionist self does not like being reminded when i do things

249 :  i cant believe it

250 :  all they really do is guide conversations between people in conflict so they can come to their own

251 :  she fixed the doorknob and then offered to take the tools back downstairs

252 :  i wish i knew how to let go sometimes and remove myself from the more aggressive parts of

253 :  hows that possible

254 :  and it became clear very quickly that the same forces the same forces that said to me

255 :  no youre not a woman those are the same forces that say theres only one way to love only one way to live

256 :  to be my authentic self and to just have my family be proud of me

257 :  im an apprentice and i work with the people who do the jobs in question

258 :  great got it

259 :  its probably the worst advice i ever got

260 :  its in the rockies

261 :  and i was reminded how utterly wrong i am so much of the time

262 :  hes good for the environment he spends his days doing this incredible service and he smells like hell but god bless him

263 :  albert hands me the knife

264 :  and im up to my neck in anagnorises every single day

265 :  were plugged in were connected

266 :  and he says bite em

267 :  matt freund a dairy farmer in new canaan connecticut who woke up one day and realized the crap from his

268 :  it was impressive

269 :  it cant be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site

270 :  i always watch the process done the first time before i try it

271 :  were on twice a day on the discovery we cant do this

272 :  he said well thats how we do it

273 :  and he says osha

274 :  how many people have their blackberry

275 :  good grief not to this crowd

276 :  its what our network does its what dirty jobs is

277 :  and i talk to him

278 :  thats what tv does

279 :  theres no writing theres no scripting theres no nonsense

280 :  its a cold war really

281 :  they look like thumbs coming right at you

282 :  i mean thats all i heard growing up

283 :  oh im dead

284 :  oh im living in a computer program

285 :  the way we portray working people on tv its laughable

286 :  i started to look at teamwork and determination

287 :  as a group theyre the happiest people i know

288 :  i said stop

289 :  most hazardous environment id ever seen and i was back with a guy lashing the pots down

290 :  meanwhile weve got two trillion dollars at a minimum according to the american society of civil engineers that we need to

291 :  because theres so much protein in the stuff we dont eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed and hes one rich pig farmer

292 :  hes making a great living

293 :  the bottom line is the same

294 :  but we dont want to stop there

295 :  this tells them the direction the balls going to go

296 :  indigenous people savage

297 :  i will even vow to protect them when they are in harms way

298 :  thats what it means to be a sikh s i k h

299 :  i will refuse to hate them even when they hate me

300 :  the contractions are less than a minute apart

301 :  when right wing nationalist movements are on the rise around the globe and have captured the presidency of the

302 :  my grandfather saw me as a warrior

303 :  revolutionary love requires us to breathe and push through the fire with a warriors heart and

304 :  if we dont breathe we will die

305 :  papa ji dried my tears gave me the words of guru nanak the founder of the sikh

306 :  when executive orders and news of violence hits our bodies hard

307 :  and in our most painful moments in the face of the fires of injustice i have

308 :  breathe she says

309 :  if someone is trying to cross the road help them cross the road

310 :  i remember that day i promised myself i would never help anyone again

311 :  now im not asking you to go around and say oh my god i love that skirt you should wear that everyday oh my god

312 :  and without that its hard to be able to define yourself

313 :  they have a very tough time distinguishing between reality and their imagination

314 :  similar to how young kids have issues doing that but they sort it out as they grow and

315 :  we need to be able to imagine what that solution is and use our imagination to help bring it to

316 :  and its not just a childish expression

317 :  and they had them do a free recall memory test

318 :  theres much more about how it applies to you

319 :  neither the concept of writing down things and passing it on for other people and spreading information

320 :  so for most of us thats what we think of when we hear the word imagination

321 :  and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror

322 :  what happens when that arrow goes awry

323 :  are you reading an interview by an author

324 :  without it we would have no music

325 :  we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless

326 :  not just are we absent from it but so is everyone else

327 :  find other books exactly like his

328 :  it threatens the flow of love

329 :  attention is time

330 :  its the whole book

331 :  but these were not the major preoccupations of my day

332 :  i wasnt the only one

333 :  it cannot be stored

334 :  and let no immigrants in anymore build a wall

335 :  its quite incredible

336 :  which up until now has had the longest known insect migration

337 :  little larvae hatch out in fresh water

338 :  i know they travel at the same altitude

339 :  they travel at exactly the same time with the same winds to make the crossing

340 :  they feed on other little things

341 :  theyre looking for somewhere to breed

342 :  wait for the go

343 :  and the dragonflies are there

344 :  here are some facts

345 :  and the other problem was i hardly knew anybody who worked in the healthcare sector

346 :  and hes doing remarkably well

347 :  i was frightened of hospitals

348 :  how are we going to stop the epidemic of cancer and other chronic diseases that we all

349 :  they have enormous purchasing power

350 :  but i had two problems in starting this organization

351 :  theyre just as addicted to fossil fuels as the rest of the economy

352 :  like many people i was horrified and moved by the photos from

353 :  so we thought ok if you can do this really for people using prosthetic devices and we can get them into running in

354 :  if we allowed refugees to do that it would have major advantages

355 :  education is often of poor quality

356 :  i think we can reconsider that choice

357 :  in theory refugees have a right to a pathway to integration or return to the country theyve come

358 :  but today that system is failing

359 :  it could also be used at the national level where one of the great challenges we face is to persuade local

360 :  king abdullah has picked up on the idea

361 :  what weve seen in europe will be with us for many years

362 :  in theory refugees have a right to seek asylum

363 :  it gives them the right to work

364 :  first why is the current system not working

365 :  it gives them freedom of movement

366 :  ice found me and declared me as illegal

367 :  at this point i knew i had kaposi sarcoma and pneumonia

368 :  all of these can be halted very easily at this point by treatment

369 :  and probably he thought that i have two masters degrees

370 :  i fought my immigration case

371 :  i found two purple lesions on my either hands and foot

372 :  i may now have access to institutions of amazing higher learning and

373 :  i could feel rodrigos touch warm hands on my cold body

374 :  this dark cell

375 :  on the fifth night i couldnt take it anymore

376 :  what would i tell them

377 :  at this point i am being taken into detention

378 :  i didnt give up

379 :  in order to help you flip the script about undocumented

380 :  think about me alone shackled in a detention cell

381 :  i stand in front of you today as a legal permanent resident of the united states

382 :  think about me dying alone in that hospital bed with my friend trying to save me

383 :  i am shackled my legs and arms and taken into a single cell where

384 :  dont add back the oil fat and sugar its a lot cheaper it really works

385 :  something is not quite right

386 :  no you should buy intrusion detection software what you really need is intrusion prevention software

387 :  okay one of his deputies

388 :  warner tell you what just send me a affidavit that says you or your wife will fly to san diego at your own expense stay in a

389 :  ill take care of defending the government facilities but you guys might want to look into some anti aircraft and maybe some

390 :  but thats exactly what weve done with cyber crime

391 :  i have connections everywhere

392 :  your kids want that new xbox one for christmas but you werent going to camp out for 48h at wallmart

393 :  he said right call your bank get the money back

394 :  i said well that would cost me more than the one thousand eight hundred i lost

395 :  so heres what were going to do

396 :  the russians may come after us

397 :  i the da have to fly them back to birmingham put them up a safe place where they

398 :  weve got students all over the world who are fighting cybercrime the way i do

399 :  isnt it the governments job to protect its citizens

400 :  to report a cyber crime

401 :  everythings missing out of your house

402 :  well we have students in the fbi and in the cia and the nsa

403 :  i said well ill start with my alma mater at uab

404 :  they said well i dont understand the objective

405 :  i heard a story from richard clarck i was at the darpa cyber colloquium in two thousand and eleven and he said what

406 :  let us come back to n

407 :  im the most myself im one hundred myself when im rapping and im not a fake

408 :  and his name is kendrick lamar

409 :  we are attracted to and tend to choose people who wound us in a similar way as a parent who wounded

410 :  one to five percent of what we do is conscious

411 :  is that crazy

412 :  if she left you tomorrow would you be okay

413 :  and you cant change your past none of us can change our past

414 :  and the first question was

415 :  quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking

416 :  its an object that behaves like a wave so that it doesnt just move in one direction or the other

417 :  and its always been a mystery how they do this

418 :  but in everyday life we can forget about it

419 :  now the earths magnetic field is very very weak its one hundred times weaker than a fridge magnet and yet it affects

420 :  so schr dinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life

421 :  thats a good thing

422 :  there are six thousand edible wild plants

423 :  you didnt have to amend the soil you didnt have to water them so that suited me fine

424 :  like i notice gary you have some nice amaranth in that weed slide

425 :  you didnt have to do all this stuff

426 :  the winds are too strong it would be blown away

427 :  this is one of xs mantras

428 :  would we see five hundred and fortyfour airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a

429 :  they dont have time to relax

430 :  what do they have to gain by sharing this information

431 :  everyone presumed they were dead

432 :  you put it in cardboard boxes

433 :  i see it in our business leaders

434 :  cesar and i tried to write a piece for the new york times magazine explaining how this works

435 :  i have no idea how to do it

436 :  were going to test them out

437 :  marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the british

438 :  he said he heard suspicious laughter

439 :  nevertheless archie managed to get permission to do this

440 :  and people do terrible things in wars

441 :  and if you cant find the answers you must be lazy or stupid

442 :  so the situation seemed pretty desperate

443 :  the german camp guards theyve got bored

444 :  we never do

445 :  it was in front of the whole class and i felt dreadful

446 :  i dont mean they cant they just often choose not to

447 :  there are many great models

448 :  but our minds are still hypnotized by them and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them

449 :  in fact on the contrary i think its still true of a minority of people

450 :  he said as a kid

451 :  everybody whos spoken at ted has told us implicitly or sometimes explicitly a different story that life is

452 :  it worked out for eric thats all im saying

453 :  can we put yours online

454 :  but its what i wanted and as soon as i left school i applied to the fire service and i was accepted

455 :  they get no great pleasure from what they do

456 :  and we must have the courage to make those choices over and over again throughout our

457 :  and i found people to interview that would legitimize my choice for me and talk more about the

458 :  or so it seemed

459 :  what would that look like

460 :  were doing that now with our design challenges

461 :  could companies actually stop competing with each other but cooperate

462 :  how does nature crosslink

463 :  so what can you do

464 :  thats what you described right

465 :  we understand the hazards of one of them

466 :  like some of the mass coffee producers claim

467 :  i can tell you from my own experience and how it feels in my body and tests are done for myself there are so many more

468 :  not days not weeks

469 :  once roasted they taste different

470 :  now is the time to wake up lg

471 :  are you ready for the age of enlightenment two
472 :  we partnered with a leading medical research institution here in boston

473 :  so heres a problem

474 :  ive got a friend in india who told me that you havent really tested a piece of electronic technology for

475 :  this is what we want

476 :  michael free at path says you have to figure out who will choose use and pay the dues for a product like this

477 :  so fireflys totally sealed

478 :  sir what is your business and who is your customer

479 :  im going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health

480 :  its not the painting we would have painted its the painting that we actually painted

481 :  are we designing for the world that we want

482 :  so we got started

483 :  it sounds crazy it sounds dumb but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and

484 :  the problem is without technicians without spare parts donations like this very quickly

485 :  manufacturing financing distribution regulation

486 :  i guess what i would say is for us for what i want to do its either too slow or it just doesnt

487 :  and thats design that matters

488 :  so similarly when we think about our partner mtts theyve made some amazing technologies

489 :  and heres what we developed

490 :  we conducted months of user research overseas trying to think like designers human centered design lets figure

491 :  who is our customer

492 :  its not uncommon for mom to put a blanket over the baby

493 :  we decided we cant put a do not enter sign next to the vent

494 :  they want buck rogers they dont want effective

495 :  we tried this time to get it right

496 :  jaundice affects two thirds of newborns around the world

497 :  are we designing for the world thats coming whether were ready or not

498 :  so heres an overhead warmer and a cpap

499 :  last story here

500 :  it won lots of awards

501 :  i got into this business designing products

502 :  i have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device

503 :  if youve checked every fact

504 :  speaking to some people

505 :  getting some proper quotes

506 :  it spends time with the community gets to know their stories

507 :  this sort of thing is happening more and more

508 :  sometimes its whole stories themselves

509 :  taking a bit of time

510 :  ten of tweets during that hour concerned her death

511 :  here is my view

512 :  but of course they are not alone

513 :  in two thousand and twelve el pa s sacked almost a one three of its editorial staff

514 :  two to one just ten years ago

515 :  thats an increase from three
516 :  thats twenty million people speaking about an event before a single news organization has published

517 :  woodward and bernstein came up against many objections and many obstacles along the way

518 :  if you have revisited every quote

519 :  there was blanket coverage

520 :  pushed the button and the story went up online

521 :  theres something very strange about this story

522 :  what happened to the survivors of the mv sewol in korea

523 :  the worlds media descended on this town

524 :  whatever happened to the miners of soma

525 :  its a recipe for disaster

526 :  ill give you a clue

527 :  if you are pessimist you might say

528 :  that concept of father knows best has a long history

529 :  the romans talked about the father of the family pater

530 :  i came across some statistics

531 :  in one thousand eight hundred and fifteen the average american ate about five pounds of sugar in a year

532 :  youre so wise

533 :  but there is another way of learning about history and it has to do with looking at the small

534 :  when the supreme court made its judgment they sided with the hospital and the state of missouri

535 :  at a family gathering she had come home from the hospital and was telling us that when she went to see her

536 :  we all know that smoking is bad but it was back in the 50s when doctors and

537 :  we learned about the emancipation proclamation

538 :  every episode went the same way pretty much

539 :  which they did

540 :  by the way not everyone stopped smoking

541 :  we learned about pearl harbor and d day

542 :  we owe it to ourselves

543 :  its going to be the same for us with regard to meat and dairy products

544 :  we know best

545 :  so we learned about the declaration of independence

546 :  author julia cameron who wrote the artists way

547 :  how much money can i save

548 :  i thanked her assuming it was fake like almost everything else for sale in dongguan

549 :  i dont want an ad in the new yorker and most of these workers dont really want iphones

550 :  all her students were marines

551 :  they make skills manifest

552 :  if i name you i assume you dont have a name for yourself or if you do i dont care

553 :  im showing up as a listener

554 :  what if we surrounded our schools with native plants which attracted native animals which created

555 :  its basic evolutionary biology

556 :  i believe that that one simple act has the power to enhance our individual well being and improve our chances for

557 :  who knows how far we could go if we funded and celebrated our listeners as much or more than our speech

558 :  but what if we made a conscious choice to reverse this trend

559 :  formal choirs and backyard jams recording sessions and band practices

560 :  there are so many things to do in this life and if we could have a simulacrum a digital

561 :  and they gave me like a little plastic ziploc bag of a small amount of powder

562 :  this is just something we tried in rats

563 :  the reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to

564 :  im as certain of that as i was of the success that weve had with direct television broadcasting

565 :  theres some three thousand people a year in the united states alone perhaps ten times that number

566 :  i would say in some ways i change my gender about as often as i change my hairstyle

567 :  and so for us the prospect of mind clones and regenerated bodies is that our love

568 :  she was a single female parent

569 :  thats why your schemas had better match reality

570 :  thats the beautiful thing about science

571 :  id studied thousands of hours of physics biology chemistry but not one hour not one concept

572 :  would you pack condoms to go to work

573 :  and we form part of a global movement demanding decriminalization and self determination

574 :  assuming you still need money youll stay in the more flexible informal economy

575 :  when france temporarily brought in the swedish model two years ago ordinary citizens took it as a cue to start

576 :  you can ask expensive escorts in new york city brothel workers in cambodia street workers in south africa

577 :  if prohibition is this harmful you might ask why is it so popular

578 :  maybe youve thought about them too

579 :  imagine knowing if youre busted carrying condoms itll be used against you

580 :  being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself

581 :  these laws also reinforce stigma and hatred against sex workers

582 :  crackdowns on buyers drive sellers to take dangerous risks and into the arms of potentially abusive managers

583 :  but if youre forced to choose between obeying the law and feeding yourself or your family youre going to do the work anyway and

584 :  as a feminist i know that the sex industry is a site of deeply entrenched social

585 :  and so the fines stack up and youre caught in a vicious cycle of selling sex to pay the fines you got

586 :  firstly sex work is and always has been a survival strategy for all kinds of unpopular minority groups

587 :  ive thought about whats needed to protect other sex workers from these things

588 :  its not going to be an option for someone whos desperate and needs money tonight

589 :  but it makes a huge difference as to whether or not theyre safe when they do them

590 :  these laws have political support precisely because they target people that voters dont want to see

591 :  in fact many migrants have made a decision out of economic need to place themselves into the hands of people

592 :  here in the uk im part of sex worker led groups like the sex worker open university and the english collective of

593 :  if you need that money the only effect that a drop in business is going have is to force you to lower your prices or offer more

594 :  sex workers are real people

595 :  what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in twentyfive years

596 :  and i was asked well arent you nervous

597 :  its hardwired in our brains

598 :  when we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago we made linear predictions where that animal would be and that worked fine

599 :  when i was a student at mit we all shared one computer that took up a whole building

600 :  its already very close to us

601 :  and the project was finished on time

602 :  well see the same thing in the economic recession were having now

603 :  and that really describes information technology

604 :  and also there is no boundary between classrooms

605 :  and this is a terrible linguistic equivalency

606 :  it is what we called socially constructed

607 :  compare your thumb to those around you

608 :  we made this up

609 :  maybe you would injure yourself doing so

610 :  and being from the us does not explain what she experienced here

611 :  now maybe this is because race doesnt actually matter in norway but i suspect thats not the case unfortunately

612 :  take a look at it

613 :  but thumb bendiness or hitchhiker thumb is also different than these other traits and thats because we dont give

614 :  girls who were told they were too sensitive too much

615 :  what is this

616 :  the shopkeepers are hiring more people

617 :  well pick it up

618 :  and the food banks are growing

619 :  well guess what

620 :  no more are we going to accept this

621 :  well make sure its stored properly

622 :  well i find parents out on the front lines very aware their children

623 :  people have to eat

624 :  at the time i was working as the science advisor to the us secretary of state then condoleezza rice

625 :  lets look at some trends

626 :  these three innovations set in motion the most profound changes in human

627 :  they are all supplied with plenty of water

628 :  but if we collectively catch too many fish they wont be able to spawn therell be no fish available to catch

629 :  another way to out this

630 :  what they find is that on the way into the park people stop to pick up that glove about sixtytwo percent

631 :  now i first learned about this story the way i learned about lots of good stories i know from the radio show this american

632 :  given our disconnection from nature i think that this might be one of the things that were underestimating that could

633 :  for us to tackle these problems we need broad buy in we need to work together we need to work collectively and

634 :  we see the same result in police data

635 :  it was actually asa carter who wrote those infamous words that wallace said on the steps of the alabama

636 :  when we ostracize the innocent it tears apart the fabric of our society which only works to format the next

637 :  i am not my father

638 :  and it wouldnt be an exaggeration to say that ninetynine
639 :  remember that extremism thrives on the fringes of society

640 :  when we divide people into smaller and smaller groups based on one arbitrary distinction or

641 :  they would not be broken by them

642 :  thats what i do but i think life theres so much more to it

643 :  it stressed me out a lot

644 :  i was envious of my friends

645 :  my parents had no idea what would transpire for the next ten years

646 :  prevailing global issues such as racism we would never even understand

647 :  they took me to the terminally ill ward

648 :  theyre supportive of your dreams

649 :  i picked it up because it was on the best seller list and it was the smallest one

650 :  i was spotted at a mall on sukhumvit and signed my contract two months after

651 :  but im human and the thing about being human is that you have the ability to

652 :  we are taught not only to embrace this naturally but to grow from it

653 :  i would tell you that from today onwards someone is going to do something to you that will hurt you that will disappoint you someone will embarrass

654 :  the great thing about melatonin is it has great antioxidant qualities that rid our brain

655 :  if the inflationary consequences of using sdrs in this way are benign

656 :  youre actually not absorbing what you read on that label because your body excretes the fiber

657 :  and i was probably about fourteen at the time

658 :  i couldnt buy it

659 :  i would get home and juice

660 :  its about one hundred pounds

661 :  it was on my legs

662 :  so you can actually juice a day in advance and it will still be rich in enzymes vitamins and minerals twentyfour hours

663 :  juicing is a great thing because its really concentrated nutrition so you cant necessarily sit down and

664 :  so throughout my research i became really into juicing

665 :  and i think that in general in our society now everybodys starting to see their health decline and theyre wondering

666 :  and juicing was really my key

667 :  so i was eating a great diet and i was eating a lot of variety in my diet but i kept showing up

668 :  and i had had some health issues

669 :  so its really important to think about that when youre buying organic produce because youre not actually

670 :  i kept reading more and more about the value of fruits and vegetables and the way that the phytonutrients the enzymes

671 :  i couldnt find it

672 :  theres two types of juicing

673 :  so i moved to san diego for law school and i told my parents all i need for school is this

674 :  and all of these things just kind of became normal to me and i never really thought wow this could be connected to

675 :  and now at every corner you see a juice bar

676 :  so eventually i got it as a joint birthday christmas present and i thought that it was just like the

677 :  growing up i had really bad eczema all over my body

678 :  i couldnt go to a juice bar

679 :  the little jack lalanne juicer that i started on is called a centrifugal juicer

680 :  this young fitness culture everybody going to yoga class grabs a green juice

681 :  its very important when youre juicing to really go organic because juicing really makes all of the toxins in the

682 :  because i think the thing we forget is we tend crazy because music is such a communal activity but we tend

683 :  its like water

684 :  we always feel that whatever we do or whatever risks we take or whatever side way we take from the kpi

685 :  now three lives wasnt the bad part of it

686 :  its like yeah i dont know if you noticed but im the guy out in the parking lot recreating one of americas finest moments with fire extinguishers

687 :  im just going to show you some footage and tell me what you think

688 :  you would never ever design a rocket like that

689 :  and i guess somebody thought they needed to do that

690 :  now ron howard ran into buzz aldrin who was not on the movie so he had no idea that we were faking any

691 :  and then i did kind of get the reaction i was hoping for

692 :  you would never have a rocket go up while the gantry arms are going out

693 :  jim cameron actually photographed the real titanic

694 :  shots were combined and i was just really curious i mean what the hell were you looking at just a few minutes ago and how

695 :  so he basically set up or basically shattered the suspension of disbelief because what he photographed was the real thing

696 :  and i answered why should i care about his religion if my ph

697 :  so they start should we call the ambulance

698 :  upon traveling to italy to work on my ph

699 :  exactly as were doing now

700 :  should we run

701 :  on my way to sesame i broke that rule and left it at home because i know that in sesame my

702 :  im a women thanks to god

703 :  and so now we can see is that really a robust signature

704 :  because if we can maybe we have a chance of actually discovering life somewhere else without being

705 :  not as far as im concerned

706 :  but each time you figure out what you want for lunch youre practicing the steps that together reveal your bigger

707 :  thats ok this is what the lunch challenge is about

708 :  that gap between lack and fulfilment is unconfortable

709 :  but its the discomfort that moves us forward

710 :  what do you want

711 :  and i felt like saying to him but i didnt say i felt like saying you know what

712 :  other countries spend about thirty
713 :  food is the one area that you get what you pay for

714 :  now in this country we spend about ten of our household income on food

715 :  and she was frustrated

716 :  our bodies are amazing

717 :  i cant afford not to eat well

718 :  she said it runs in his family

719 :  lots of animal products

720 :  and in that situation sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack it will be very difficult to say who

721 :  we have license plates on cars tail numbers on aircraft

722 :  power was focused at the very top

723 :  frontline sms today is used in about one hundred and seventy countries twenty to thirty million people are benefiting

724 :  and you cant see them because theres a power cut

725 :  it all charges up wonderfully then you bring in at night and if you need to do an operation at night the

726 :  of course subtitles usually translate into a different language not into the same language

727 :  and when we end up with technology that we can use without necessarily always having to really make it work

728 :  and we get this too in the social innovation space

729 :  but its a spanish film and they were learning spanish at the time

730 :  thank you very much

731 :  people come up with solutions to problems by chance and accidentally

732 :  and people build smartphone apps for health care workers across the developing world they build farm maps they build

733 :  none of these are using the organisms

734 :  and that information will go into asknature

735 :  and theyre having appliances in your home talk to one another through that algorithm and

736 :  its kind of a forward osmosis

737 :  nature has been doing that for a long time

738 :  it was so architectural

739 :  i smile work hard why should my conscience twitch or flinch

740 :  but they reminded me that the power to survive and in fact the power to thrive mentally in a situation like that

741 :  this is a poem about mark antony

742 :  its more powerful

743 :  a kid of five or sixtyfive voted in the same way

744 :  i knew nothing

745 :  stands for something

746 :  some expert i was on leadership

747 :  we agreed that addresses were bad

748 :  we thought it was essential that people should be able to use this system in their own language

749 :  we even had to add someone to our schedules who was the person you called when you thought youd arrived but then realized you hadnt

750 :  they couldnt get any more wound up

751 :  those with mtbi had different patterns on the various tasks but they were

752 :  so physical trauma and psychological trauma had distinct effects on the brain

753 :  let me give you a little bit of background

754 :  it is not something that can be diagnosed easily

755 :  but the soldiers reacted

756 :  and if you look at this network it involves frontal areas hippocampal areas temporal lobe areas that are

757 :  we had two groups from the military

758 :  i was asked a question by defense canada

759 :  otherwise i was just pushing it away

760 :  receiving and giving is actually the exact same action

761 :  as leonard cohen says theres a crack in everything and thats how the light gets in

762 :  in exactly the way that she did because the difference was that she really meant it and then she waited for my answer and

763 :  it was when i was honest with myself and let go of an agenda and stop trying to make things happen that love could

764 :  and thats ok and its normal

765 :  and it said i am extremely precious im life itself

766 :  id heard about a zen monastery which is in england

767 :  i will start with a cheap visual stunt to grab your attention and cover the fact that my act is

768 :  i would explain why i think this is a lousy trick

769 :  i think its a lousy trick because at its core its just a puzzle

770 :  happiness and integrity they cant be reached by walking away from unhappiness

771 :  unhappiness is the front door

772 :  ive seen dozens of organizations and hundreds of people seek happiness or try to maintain their integrity

773 :  diagnosing unhappiness isnt hard

774 :  unhappiness is the doorway

775 :  i can never remember right

776 :  thats what the pain is for

777 :  we turn that frown upside down

778 :  what have you found

779 :  im etched in their souls as they are etched in mine on this life long journey of discovery and communication

780 :  i said what is it

781 :  and one and a half million people have liked me

782 :  and how many people are working towards a dream

783 :  we went to some live fights

784 :  and im just amazed at the opened doors

785 :  what can we do

786 :  what a powerful message to their children

787 :  nine years ago i co founded a womens entrepreneur organization in penang together with my good friend

788 :  our creative team came up with this concept

789 :  some parents ask me what if we share about integrity and then we fail or we fall

790 :  i believe something powerful happens when we put pen to paper

791 :  and i always believe that when women can help other women it is so empowering

792 :  we can have speaking engagements create workshops

793 :  there were papers everywhere

794 :  we pass it down from generation to generation

795 :  they had the logic

796 :  and out from behind a tree comes this half crazed man and he begins chasing you and youre running and youre

797 :  if jenipher wants credit her options are limited

798 :  a hundred years ago the first forester of the commonwealth rothrock wrote about the pennsylvania desert

799 :  but we hit the crisis in a world where we might have committed ourselves to enough sea level rise to disappear out of that

800 :  youre not very cool are you

801 :  that we all know of

802 :  thats not an exaggeration

803 :  but this schools done a lot for me

804 :  i was literally too tired to do anything else

805 :  they dont work

806 :  of course they have and im amazingly appreciative of that absolutely

807 :  im obsessed with clouds

808 :  i got ill one day

809 :  everythings moving so fast and you cant actually do anything about it

810 :  im massively oversimplifying here but the way a good doctor would diagnose

811 :  my routine was literally wake up at one p

812 :  those three things are like i said its all in your mind get over it yoga and

813 :  how do you get better

814 :  i share this story with a lot of people with cfs

815 :  even this school you know

816 :  seriously clouds are beautiful

817 :  all of your friends are running about living their own lives doing their own things and you cant interact with them youre trapped

818 :  is there more they could have done

819 :  thats huge thats amazing

820 :  you all need to appreciate them more

821 :  the next positive i found is ive realized just how lucky i am

822 :  i have known people go months or years without a diagnosis

823 :  but have they done a lot anyway

824 :  time doesnt heal anything

825 :  dear mind sorry for thinking too much

826 :  remember the hand

827 :  we have seen this question several times why

828 :  and i looked for that possibility and the possibility was personal freedom

829 :  ive got a thirty second experiment that will push you past your comfort zone

830 :  how do sharing and transactions go together

831 :  theres a complete stranger sleeping in my living room

832 :  i live in america their other enemy

833 :  but that turned out to be nearly impossible

834 :  the flowers are named after him the mountains are carved with his slogans

835 :  how was i training folks and what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles to doing it faster and to

836 :  now try and wrap your head around that for a second

837 :  you just had teams of hundreds of people

838 :  as far as i knew that was the only way you could distribute technology and i couldnt figure out a way around it

839 :  we have paper forms for vaccination surveys

840 :  it kind of frightens me to think of how long ago that was

841 :  now one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive obviously that was quite a long time ago

842 :  and you go out there and you spend money on airfare and you spend time and you spend per diem and you

843 :  its always guys that look pretty much like me flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other

844 :  we have paper forms to track people who come into clinics

845 :  and so i began to rack my brain trying to think about what was the process that i was doing

846 :  and unfortunately after thinking about this for some time i identified the main obstacle

847 :  while i was thinking about it people started using even more things like this just as we were

848 :  and what theyre talking about is all of the information that were generating through our interaction with and over the internet

849 :  thats less than i used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation

850 :  now we knew when we built this system the whole point of it just like with the palmpilots was that youd be

851 :  and the main obstacle it turned out and this is a sad realization the main obstacle was me

852 :  why not technology companies

853 :  and i think tedx is really the perfect platform for us to challenge our tech industry leaders to set an ethical

854 :  adelaide introduced the adelaide free wi fi network throughout the cbd a first for australia

855 :  isnt it just another form of play

856 :  but what we do know is infant development

857 :  this ladies and gentlemen is our new brain drain

858 :  and i really do believe thats the key to achieving your dream

859 :  unfortunately however that was not the case for mr

860 :  my call to action for you today is that you take the time and invest in transitional housing for one of the most vulnerable segments of our

861 :  grandma instilled in my mother the importance of education

862 :  and then finally let me point out the last one a quirky one

863 :  you might think this is not much compared to the billions of neurons we have

864 :  we worry about how you can get away from people

865 :  you can see the great chinese famine

866 :  we worry about how many people there are

867 :  a lot of change is gradual

868 :  but when we go to pick that college major the question changes from what do you want to be when you grow up

869 :  thats what determines how each egg is unique

870 :  it comes from who you get to be while youre doing that job

871 :  everyones unique we dont cross over we dont have to compete

872 :  but its an epidemic that has a cure

873 :  i think its because when we are in doubt we look to our resume

874 :  happy at work

875 :  i needed to allow the dream to change form

876 :  the answer came to me in a flash

877 :  all the things that happened which made that resume that made your life story thats what reveals your blueprint

878 :  she was a top salesperson she won all the cars all the trips but she started talking about how she was

879 :  what are you talking about happy

880 :  but when i think about this subject i think of my grandfather my immigrant grandfather who left poland

881 :  and then what do you do

882 :  he would say

883 :  but at the time we met he wasnt sure what he wanted to do next

884 :  and so recently scientists have suggested that herodotus crazy story is actually true

885 :  they never give you a challenge you cant achieve

886 :  five million people use it every month

887 :  so thats what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student

888 :  this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win

889 :  now this sounds crazy right

890 :  but it is not by any means an optimal situation

891 :  and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience

892 :  we do achieve more in game worlds

893 :  okay we can do that

894 :  thats an epic win

895 :  now i know youre asking how are we going to solve real world problems in games

896 :  you know when you wake up that when you climb three hundred and seventyfour stairs you will get an award called the statue of liberty

897 :  and its not my academic credentials that qualify me to share this with you its my

898 :  everybody is looking at you and youre creating an experience that theyre going to remember and maybe other people are going to relive

899 :  so no problem i go down to the basement climbed twenty stairs

900 :  and this striiv also has adaptive benchmarks

901 :  youre creating stories that you can share potentially even with your grand children

902 :  and i think its also possible that we could predict which behaviors would spread and

903 :  you do the math

904 :  ten thousand steps is five miles

905 :  i would love to hear about it

906 :  is going to become an addiction if it meets those needs in a powerful way

907 :  that whatever job youre doing if you feel like youre making progress from day to day youre going to be excited

908 :  ill be talking with you today about a framework for understanding things that create addictive

909 :  youre the center of attention

910 :  i am a scientist and this is the kind of claim that cant be empirically validated so i cant go out and test it

911 :  ill share how each of these fits with striiv as we go through

912 :  so you know how youre supposed to reach ten thousand steps a day as an ideal goal for living a healthy life and being a healthy

913 :  youre meeting your need for uncertainty because as we said variety its the spice of life youre doing something

914 :  so need for significance

915 :  at this point the american bar association which is not the vanguard of cool they have a whole page on their website

916 :  and looking at the six human needs again lets think about it

917 :  and i am taking in a perspective of the flash mober which is another term in the dictionary

918 :  this is also why we buy lottery tickets

919 :  so when youre coming together in a flash mob with other people its as if you become this group

920 :  so not a contagious behavior and this is why we have to regulate it

921 :  were cutting corners and every time we cut corners more places get infected that shouldnt have and it just slows us

922 :  it doesnt survive in the environment hardly at all

923 :  we have a big gap in that money

924 :  they had come from thousands of miles away

925 :  now when humans think about sex male and female forms are generally what come to mind but for many

926 :  its simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action

927 :  but some animals had it going on quite a bit before that

928 :  and quite frankly thats exactly what it is

929 :  but orgasm didnt actually evolve until about sixtyfive million years ago with the advent of mammals

930 :  simply insert part a into slot b and we should all be good to go

931 :  and of course my father worked hard

932 :  its not a suitcase

933 :  and there have been so many here that have been part of this cause

934 :  and this disease would spread from one community to another

935 :  and help in this case didnt come from the outside it actually came from within

936 :  and shes amazing

937 :  my mom came knocking one morning and said raj pack your things we have to go

938 :  but this was also the end of a seven year relationship with the dawn wall

939 :  my girlfriend and i with two friends had helicoptered into a remote mountain region in southwest kyrgyzstan

940 :  on our 8th day we woke to gunshots hunters i thought

941 :  i was aware of every sound every movement

942 :  i noticed my night vision improving

943 :  my sister was six i was two and a half and still in diapers and we were sleeping in a snow cave deep in

944 :  what makes the difference

945 :  we keep doing it

946 :  as it got dark two of our captors forced us to drop everything and run with them

947 :  and im telling a story that many of you know because steves columns became the basis for a book which was

948 :  maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain regardless of its size

949 :  no other animal cooks its food

950 :  maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way

951 :  but lets play along

952 :  only humans do

953 :  and here comes the bad news our brain not the largest one around

954 :  so this is a first indication that the all brains are made the same way scenario is not quite right

955 :  are we making the heroic choices so our families can say i love you much like we say i love that

956 :  we dont want to fight but krishna says you must fight

957 :  they seem to be after the one thing that we all have that we all possess

958 :  thats a kickstarter for the character something happens to that character to make them decide whether im going

959 :  but the question is what choices are we making in our lives

960 :  we have to engage you

961 :  and from the directors chair it made me realize sometimes life is a battle

962 :  and i remember laying in bed and my mom crying no no no three
963 :  the first is called the ordinary world

964 :  what is my purpose in life

965 :  we created a structure and strategy by which we would support the

966 :  i wanted to demand to pray to beseech them to stop their raids and ask for them to meet with us local

967 :  the ice executives were sitting way across the table from us

968 :  they were sitting outside their house waiting for their nephew to come home who was just playing basketball at a

969 :  the answer is

970 :  there is not one single answer

971 :  how can media earn money to survive

972 :  and so far in the h5n1 cases in people similarly bacterial infection has not been an issue at

973 :  and i would just add we saw the same thing with sars

974 :  but we dont really know

975 :  and i think my time is up

976 :  so were going to have to go all out thermonuclear response stimulate the total cytokine cascade

977 :  i could give you a bunch of flip this that and the other

978 :  hes like no no

979 :  and it set me in motion for what is now almost two decades of research about how social transformation

980 :  they talk about it all the time

981 :  because as we look at these changes that are facing us and we can see them in climate

982 :  pharmaceutical technology does not

983 :  but heres the best news of all

984 :  or maybe they are but i just couldnt see it back then

985 :  but they dont have to be

986 :  can you imagine being born in a refugee camp growing up in a refugee camp becoming an adult

987 :  on the contrary we found almost ubiquitous mobile phone use

988 :  and hes been there since

989 :  the urban context of the capital city kampala and two refugee settlements among somalis

990 :  over a quarter of its population are now syrian refugees

991 :  there were many examples of contributions

992 :  theyve been in exile for at least five years

993 :  people fleeing for their lives

994 :  now theres nothing inevitable about wulis situation

995 :  now in his mid 40s he suffers from diabetes and hypertension and hes given up hope of leaving

996 :  and we also conducted a survey in three different sites

997 :  is there another world we can imagine in which we document that positive contribution

998 :  what i found was lots of literature on refugees

999 :  they are not

1000 :  i met people from bosnia from kosovo from china from iraq iran liberia

1001 :  its not that painful but its quite embarrassing

1002 :  they had a huge range of activities

1003 :  buses run daily between the nakivale refugee settlement and the capital city transporting refugees

1004 :  but that business isnt run by ugandans

1005 :  there was a huge variation in outcomes

1006 :  there is another way of looking at this

1007 :  take the example of lebanon with a population of just over four million

1008 :  but it lacks two things

1009 :  i think its unfair

1010 :  and turbines are ugly

1011 :  so i define chutzpah very differently

1012 :  lets get practical

1013 :  its always been true up until now but did moses come down from mt

1014 :  what absolute rubbish

1015 :  who had something negative on the sign

1016 :  will you make a wind turbine look pretty

1017 :  were never going to escape

1018 :  and the critics hated it because they thought it was a joke he was playing on them

1019 :  im here to sell you chutzpah your own chutzpah

1020 :  he didnt want to take her matches

1021 :  people dont like turbines

1022 :  because you need to

1023 :  a lot of people said

1024 :  thats a fact

1025 :  two separate facts

1026 :  unprincipled people already have plenty of chutzpah dont worry about them

1027 :  and it takes chutzpah to stop believing them and make a breakthrough

1028 :  thats a fact

1029 :  i dont even care if it doesnt produce electricity

1030 :  so we started to challenge these facts

1031 :  no not true

1032 :  and its all around

1033 :  more than a tomboy i was a trouble maker

1034 :  so how we feel we appear to others is enourmously important to our lives

1035 :  quite to the contrary i was a tomboy

1036 :  and were miserable not because the other guy cant run a good meeting its because of mas our mindless accept syndrome

1037 :  theres the moderator who has no idea how to run the meeting

1038 :  and a well run meeting can yield really positive actionable results

1039 :  im talking about time

1040 :  its right at our fingertips literally

1041 :  youd make a stink

1042 :  and collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise

1043 :  and yet you accept the meeting invitation and you go

1044 :  four years old de rihya

1045 :  and i would like to share something with you in closing

1046 :  but he wouldnt stop

1047 :  i was fighting that process

1048 :  we also need to be for something

1049 :  here we are

1050 :  evelyn forget discovered that the people in dauphin had not only become richer but also smarter and healthier

1051 :  it gets slower and slower making errors

1052 :  weve got the research weve got the evidence and weve got the means

1053 :  but its not enough

1054 :  what they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind

1055 :  now you know how to play it

1056 :  you heard that sound go up in the room

1057 :  you can teach other people

1058 :  they look kind of weak

1059 :  youve been sitting for awhile so the physical relief getting to shake it out

1060 :  so eric would have won

1061 :  how many people are like me

1062 :  because there arent that many people who know how to play we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess

1063 :  how many of you won just won thumb

1064 :  theyre not paying attention

1065 :  i will just leave you with this tip if you want to play again

1066 :  just admit it

1067 :  you were like what the hell is she talking about

1068 :  we can really go for it

1069 :  when was the last time you were at ted and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room

1070 :  we had excitement

1071 :  i said massively multiplayer thumb wrestling

1072 :  this is true so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute you will get to feel

1073 :  if you have a free thumb wave it around to make sure

1074 :  you got to stand up

1075 :  and what we found was that this problem can and its already being fixed in pockets across the

1076 :  lets challenge them to take the responsibility for our health more seriously

1077 :  bean and safeway

1078 :  and why not me

1079 :  then some sporting event happens and youve got only the resources that youve collected thus far to meet the next five years of

1080 :  but who knows that

1081 :  weve been able to see the same transformation in texas and in alabama

1082 :  so thats what were working on

1083 :  and youve only got about seven days to capture fifty percent of all of the web searches that will ever be made to help your

1084 :  after a lamppost flew by my family and i sprinted into the basement

1085 :  you sent me to that place on washington street yesterday and now im covered in poison ivy

1086 :  as we watched they became frustrated and left to go find somebody to help on their own

1087 :  in a country like ours where we breathe wi fi leveraging technology for a faster recovery should be a no

1088 :  the point is if theres a flood or a fire or a hurricane you or somebody like you are going to step

1089 :  in a disaster however you start with all of the interest and none of the capacity

1090 :  im a campaign organizer

1091 :  were working on getting the software to places so people expect it so people know how to use it and so it can be filled ahead of time with that

1092 :  so they use post its or excel or facebook

1093 :  im good at facebook

1094 :  but it gave me hope that i could be treated

1095 :  i had a sick body that was all

1096 :  and in norway researchers are running a phase three clinical trial on a cancer drug that in some patients

1097 :  the problem is that this can cause real harm

1098 :  like the hysteria of old this has everything to do with gender and with whose stories we believe

1099 :  it is a perfect custom prison

1100 :  and she turned around and walked away

1101 :  they were super excited

1102 :  they thought that this would make hiring more objective less biased and give women and

1103 :  they make mistakes but thats exactly my point

1104 :  its ethics all the way down

1105 :  remember for things you havent even disclosed

1106 :  i always went

1107 :  i researched this and found this was a widespread problem

1108 :  was it my facebook friends

1109 :  are airplanes safer

1110 :  its a commercial black box

1111 :  i was troubled

1112 :  theres no right answer

1113 :  impunity was broken

1114 :  we want that experience

1115 :  but the question i ask you is is thats all that were content to use augmented reality for

1116 :  i have to use words

1117 :  it was more entertaining

1118 :  they want to be their favorite player

1119 :  can you get this on a running back

1120 :  fans want to be on that field

1121 :  they like winning

1122 :  because teams always use technology to win games

1123 :  fans want to be on the field

1124 :  i think adult diaper sales may surge

1125 :  its also for jocks

1126 :  normally you wouldnt be able to see him but the augmented reality system lets you know

1127 :  how do we use this to win games

1128 :  but just as the internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us it has also opened up each and every one of

1129 :  its just we already thought of that

1130 :  you might fear seeing your shadow

1131 :  you think of them as flawed or defective

1132 :  i have told people hey call or text any time but i might not be able to get back to you that same day

1133 :  can i call you every day

1134 :  you may worry that you wont know what to say and every attempt at conversation will

1135 :  what if instead of the hospital they were at your kitchen table and told you they were really depressed

1136 :  its not hard science but i worked with a lot of people i know whove lived with depression

1137 :  i live pretty well with my bipolar condition and ive overcome some other mental health conditions like

1138 :  you dont have to connect

1139 :  take whats useful

1140 :  here are some possible reasons why some of you may avoid depressed people

1141 :  your depressed friends could be a good source of free labor

1142 :  people can be sad and okay at the same time

1143 :  maybe text you every day and call later in the week

1144 :  would you be comfortable talking to them

1145 :  also things that make some people feel better may not work for us

1146 :  what works for you

1147 :  so some of these things may apply to you personally some may not

1148 :  they need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors

1149 :  its really terrifying

1150 :  ninetynine spy on your ex girlfriend software online

1151 :  when i arrived i got to eat all of my favorite foods

1152 :  they are more confident

1153 :  their reasons were varied but their reasons were very real

1154 :  they needed what those women could bring to the table

1155 :  the two of us would spend hours trying to put it together while we chatted comfortably

1156 :  i tried to analyze that kind of knowledge

1157 :  no human can ever do that

1158 :  and in fact i had kind of missed the boat because in one thousand nine hundred and ninety unesco had recognized the same

1159 :  i was sitting in a roadside cafe

1160 :  supermarkets are an easy place to start

1161 :  it has been a success story

1162 :  we start out with nine

1163 :  id been round the back

1164 :  so heres the word

1165 :  the babies at the high end are vulnerable because they got too much nutrition and thats almost

1166 :  now what about the babies at the high end

1167 :  those babies are very different and they are vulnerable for the rest of their life

1168 :  is they cause an inflammatory reaction thats very low grade and they make those people

1169 :  i hope youll enjoy it so you will feel like were all part of the same team thats going to make our world

1170 :  and what are we going to do about this

1171 :  why are they vulnerable

1172 :  and that doesnt change

1173 :  that can be for lots of reasons

1174 :  thats one hundred million kilos a day

1175 :  which it was never designed or qualified for

1176 :  to give you an idea the average mars mission takes hundreds of scientists for years to

1177 :  in this case thats not enough

1178 :  what this taught me was i had come to point where i hated silence

1179 :  my mom started shortly after they got married

1180 :  i switched my major about four times before finally landing on international studies and eventually choosing public health

1181 :  how did i turn my life around

1182 :  let me back up a little bit

1183 :  one id always struggled with self confidence and i would set my standards for myself so high that anytime

1184 :  so what is meditation

1185 :  but those were temporary satisfactions

1186 :  its writers block its not understanding a concept at school

1187 :  thats where i realized i was going wrong

1188 :  just to be clear were not opposed to receiving donations lg

1189 :  we realized that many people are very willing to contribute to meaningful change

1190 :  it was when i spent time sailing on the mediterranean sea and i saw more waste floating around in

1191 :  it should not be our objective to have good laws or good policies it should be our objective to have

1192 :  there have been amazing achievements by thousands of people organizations states environmental

1193 :  she was talking about my brother

1194 :  and so she had never met them before never talked to them before never gotten the chance to know their

1195 :  i purposely picked this example because i know theres probably people in the audience who have very strong opinions about gmo its a hot

1196 :  dont think too hard about it just think about what your sense is okay

1197 :  you ask people to try to explain

1198 :  we tend to take these critically important policy issues and we see them

1199 :  we think were right

1200 :  our leaders are incredibly passionate about their positions and so are we

1201 :  when you see a cloud from a distance what do you see

1202 :  explain how a toilet works

1203 :  once they realize that their level of confidence is not justified by their knowledge they moderate their

1204 :  no im sorry not explain it but provide reasons for it

1205 :  what makes us so passionate about our positions

1206 :  maybe youre for maybe youre against it

1207 :  thats the question ive been studying in my lab

1208 :  what i would implore you to do though is to think about it think about how much you actually understand

1209 :  when she gets stronger he gets stronger

1210 :  i reclaimed my body after a lifetime of self criticism brought on by a

1211 :  you think anyone anytime anywhere can tell you what you can and cannot do in your body

1212 :  it was a celebration of the feminine body

1213 :  so i knew something was missing inside of me

1214 :  my names wyatt

1215 :  and the best part was my parents told us that at his new school we wouldnt have to hide anymore

1216 :  so at waynflete they start each school year off by sending the students on a bonding trip

1217 :  you have the power to educate others and yourself

1218 :  i didnt have any sleepovers i didnt visit any friends i was like a ghost

1219 :  and it put no strain on the other students because they were all used into it with me

1220 :  it had been so easy when i was younger

1221 :  in those two years of being so diligent at keeping my secret i had actually forgotten how to come out to

1222 :  passports licenses taxes applications even bathrooms

1223 :  we dont get to focus on

1224 :  after a few months of isolation i decided to start using the girls bathroom again of my own accord

1225 :  and i latched onto this kid

1226 :  this was the beginning of my dad really trying to come around to me being transgender and everyone in my family helped

1227 :  and she gave me the confidence to keep coming out to other kids at waynflete as the weeks went on

1228 :  i just thought you were going to give me a test to see how my memorys doing

1229 :  remember these early modules in these peoples full identities were

1230 :  and i certainly didnt do myself any favors

1231 :  there you are in my ear

1232 :  thats how they market me

1233 :  but girls especially were expected to be sexy while avoiding being perceived

1234 :  its perfect thats grand

1235 :  class lets be absolutely certain all electronic devices are switched off

1236 :  it was quite binary at that time

1237 :  most women in the early 2000s considered themselves empowered and men generally felt they were also

1238 :  no right im ready

1239 :  and actually like bros before hos it doesnt mean like what it sounds like

1240 :  right right so people will be able to feel my experience and my memory

1241 :  yeah but like i dont think of myself like providing direct sex care services per

1242 :  well its not like what you have with the internet

1243 :  its my first since bridge and tunnel which i did on broadway and this one i thank

1244 :  well ive got this terrible dichotomy

1245 :  this was also known as a mobile phone

1246 :  just a drop more

1247 :  and remember this was the very first year of the bert program

1248 :  i just i dont care what these young girls say

1249 :  yeah she knows im here

1250 :  she said maureen fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore virgin dichotomy

1251 :  what was your name

1252 :  im trying to talk to bert right now

1253 :  well for me though it was as a girl it started with me dad

1254 :  oh because it includes pornography also

1255 :  but what was the question again

1256 :  so another fact most people did not know was the average age of an at risk girl being

1257 :  the final thing that we do

1258 :  one third of the food that we produce in the world is going to waste

1259 :  what if we could get wasted on waste

1260 :  for the last few years ive been the uk country director for an international organisation called

1261 :  and quite right too

1262 :  then eighteen months ago i got chatting to one of the change makers within the network called tristram

1263 :  we source our bread from sandwich manufacturers where the heel of a loaf of bread the crust of a loaf

1264 :  we want to brew as much of that bread that would otherwise go to waste as possible

1265 :  weve collaborated with breweries all over the country to create new bread beers and tackle bread waste at a

1266 :  hes pioneered the fight against food waste

1267 :  tristram founded feedback and feedback has changed government policy theyve launched

1268 :  i must have seen thousands of ideas over the years and ive done my best to help wherever i can

1269 :  but were not done yet

1270 :  and in a wonderful alchemy what ive given away has given me stability from which i can view

1271 :  the second is that leaders are expected to fade away whether or not it is labeled as such

1272 :  ego is one of these things thats a good servant and a terrible master

1273 :  but i think this maybe be one of the things macarthur meant when he said that

1274 :  and this was sixty years ago nepal

1275 :  depression is like a parasite

1276 :  i dont have the solution to breaking down the stigma but i do need to stress how important it is

1277 :  we need to be aware

1278 :  we need to help these people that are suffering

1279 :  we need to be conscious of it

1280 :  they run the organic farming operation

1281 :  so i emailed her and she said id love to have you come on up

1282 :  and i didnt miss it

1283 :  she and john ryder her husband are actually the only two ryders that live on the property

1284 :  and keep us living lives that are safe and tidy

1285 :  heres what didnt happen

1286 :  it is work and its work i love

1287 :  and in case there is any sort of question im very well aware that not everyone has a long

1288 :  i have an agent so its obviously going really really well for me

1289 :  for me there wasnt a lightbulb moment

1290 :  on march seventeen two thousand and nine i wrote an email to a fourth cousin once removed i

1291 :  word got out about space

1292 :  tell me something about her family background that would indicate why she might feel comfortable around troubled people

1293 :  and then i go to school and i do tidy up time and when a new girl comes in i show her around

1294 :  surrender to help

1295 :  im quite happy to do that

1296 :  if youre busy doing the washing up and youre kind of stressed and they come in and start going maam

1297 :  ive set you up for this and i actually need to start getting a handle on how i behave as a result of how

1298 :  ill lay the table

1299 :  and thats normal

1300 :  such a nice child to have around

1301 :  and the parents hear

1302 :  i dont know what you mean by a feeling

1303 :  the parent generally speaking will do one of two things

1304 :  so when mum needs help ill say

1305 :  and i thought surrender to help

1306 :  lets worry about you

1307 :  so i used to spend my life playing performing people pleasing being defiant being the rebel being anyone

1308 :  i either get do you know what

1309 :  this is the aa twelve step fellowship program which fundamentally is about surrender

1310 :  so when were treating addiction sure we got to get people sober from whatever their addictive pattern is

1311 :  and when you look in the mirror to really appreciate that and to make the best friend you can of yourself because if

1312 :  yes we work with people who might want to take medication alongside but im really interested

1313 :  far from it

1314 :  who can take eighteen months

1315 :  maybe theyd done something that was impossible for us

1316 :  but this is something every one of us can do now

1317 :  im a long way from that mountain retreat now

1318 :  but over time we saw friends transformed by the practice we read commentary from across the ages a lot of it

1319 :  or to take it to another level

1320 :  join me in telling international organizations like the un like the world bank like the who that

1321 :  and i remember that day

1322 :  we were able to get gay men drug users sex workers in the agenda

1323 :  something was not right because i wasnt preaching because i wanted to change life

1324 :  after paying them my parents never felt the same about living in iraq

1325 :  i wonder where taking risks will take you all

1326 :  i remember playing kickball for the first couple of times

1327 :  i began getting used to working alone

1328 :  they forgot that the roots of modern civilization was in mesopotamia

1329 :  it may seem like fifteen twenty twentyfive and thats not necessarily a bad thing

1330 :  another great one is increased creativity

1331 :  festivals promote diversity they bring neighbors into dialogue they increase

1332 :  i mean id thought about the harbour bridge or bondi beach but minto

1333 :  in one thousand nine hundred and fortyseven the edinburgh festival was born and avignon was born and hundreds of others would

1334 :  because the welfare state and the unions work in tandem with capitalist dynamics

1335 :  its so expensive to have these people working there

1336 :  i don t blame them

1337 :  this wasnt easily accepted by everybody around me

1338 :  i had a lot of

1339 :  potentially they havent represent our human body

1340 :  everything weve been trained to do

1341 :  so i went through all the usual questions

1342 :  and my brother turned around to me and said im really concerned that you cant keep a normal job for more

1343 :  but you spent seven years training to be a doctor

1344 :  they are hard enough to remember as they are

1345 :  we have set guidelines

1346 :  i asked him about presenting complaint his medical history his drug history allergies

1347 :  its not the first time that ive gone a little bit off track

1348 :  i also have a problem with the word bimar

1349 :  medicine is complicated

1350 :  now doctors and nurses they too get trained

1351 :  and then youre out on the street and you dont know where to go

1352 :  but were here to talk about possible solutions and some good

1353 :  we can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to hiv

1354 :  im hiv positive

1355 :  and the nurse takes you into a room and she tells you about the tests and hiv and the medicines you can take and how to take care of

1356 :  and yet the reality in resource poor countries in the absence of tests and treatment forty percent

1357 :  these mothers we call them mentor mothers are able to engage women who just like themselves

1358 :  and i want to change the story a little bit

1359 :  and if we can change enough communities we can change national attitudes

1360 :  and this is so important in breaking through the stigma

1361 :  so its the test a mother gets when she comes in

1362 :  i thought you were going to throw me out of the family

1363 :  and im going to talk about annual pregnancies and hiv positive mothers

1364 :  the last sister stood up and said im also positive

1365 :  i started the program in capetown south africa back in two thousand and one
1366 :  the father and the mother together they get the results

1367 :  im sure everyone here has done some great and pretty cool things

1368 :  im not a person who hates the ocean

1369 :  but ive always had a fear of sharks and what laid deep beneath me in the water

1370 :  according to the noaa the national oceanic and atmosphere administration the ocean

1371 :  well i too felt this pit of exitement inside me

1372 :  the media portrays these creatures as monsters killing machines

1373 :  our plan was to snorkel over it

1374 :  and there we were in the middle of the cobalt blue expanse

1375 :  and what have we just learned in the last few weeks

1376 :  how would you characterize that

1377 :  but heres where it really counted what really stuck with me

1378 :  but i think in this regard that so much of it is also about technology that the technology has to also

1379 :  another one bites the dust

1380 :  i thought maybe i was wrong maybe id forgotten what objectivity was

1381 :  it was about twentyfive years ago

1382 :  and theyve created a massive economy for themselves and an amazing amount of income

1383 :  and in fact the opposite has happened

1384 :  send it out there

1385 :  it worried me that i was being accused of this

1386 :  it was yesterday

1387 :  that actually there has been a major problem in that regard and now theyre having to investigate it and

1388 :  so its pretty stressful right now

1389 :  i was young then

1390 :  and i asked him to tell me about love

1391 :  yesterday i happened to have an interview with him

1392 :  im very proud to say i got his first international interview

1393 :  and he said i love my wife she is part of me weve been together for decades

1394 :  it worked in the united states it didnt work in france it hasnt worked in germany

1395 :  you walk outside but somethings different

1396 :  then i looked at the pictures

1397 :  i had a client charged with a serious assault

1398 :  thank you very much

1399 :  eventually i realized that it was ok to not do what she was doing and she was still going to be proud of

1400 :  i need somebody to hold the camera

1401 :  everyone does not have a chalked out path

1402 :  but just because six of them said no to you in a row doesnt mean youll give up on going home right

1403 :  and let me tell you not a lot of those auditions actually translated into offers but it turned

1404 :  but when i was a little kid i used to have really short hair

1405 :  when i started with the internet which was about a year and a half ago wed all been used

1406 :  but i realized that i shouldnt give up and i kept at it and im glad that i did

1407 :  albert einstein once said

1408 :  things dont always work according to plan

1409 :  that cup song that happened on a whim too

1410 :  there are two programs that im a part of that have helped me learn some social skills and i

1411 :  the first one is toastmasters

1412 :  it does not really matter why you are

1413 :  if i have it in my mind that something is supposed to be a certain way and it does not

1414 :  aspergers syndrome is a disorder on the mild end of the autism spectrum and its most

1415 :  now let me explain one more thing

1416 :  if i do dont tell me what the mistake is just say youre close or something and ill

1417 :  this time i wont even write these down

1418 :  the odds of me getting all three of these right by pure guessing would be one in one thousand
1419 :  tell me in advance the day of the week

1420 :  im going to try to square some three digit numbers

1421 :  one digit at a time i shall try and determine the digit youve left out

1422 :  we see the brain tripling in size

1423 :  no instinct is there for no reason

1424 :  thats what weve evolved to feel

1425 :  its a golf balls worth in the past twenty thousand
1426 :  it seems like the natural diet that therefore brings about the conditions of good health in the body

1427 :  until agriculture it was very much about surviving the moment and doing the right thing now

1428 :  i think this is the majority of people

1429 :  i mean the point at which we switched over to eating meat we werent like the chimpanzee able to

1430 :  so theyre bringing out the big guns here

1431 :  weve lost a tennis balls worth of brain in the past thirty thousand years

1432 :  why would you go after this stuff when its so much more difficult

1433 :  because the process of getting older in the past wasnt about forward planning

1434 :  we see the appearance of the modern neocortex which is the executive layer of the human brain that defines how we perceive

1435 :  but aside from that just being vegan is so useful in terms of society because

1436 :  so i think we have to acknowledge that for a lot of people its not that they dont know whats wrong its that they dont feel a really

1437 :  there are many theories on that that makes sense to me

1438 :  its to think of what could go wrong

1439 :  theres no risk involved

1440 :  so why are the stakes higher for this

1441 :  theres no threat involved

1442 :  my job is to root out and prevent activity that might

1443 :  thats pretty clearly not a good thing

1444 :  nine hundred and ninetynine percent of tweets pose no risk to anyone

1445 :  and woodys up on deck and at least if they are hit he probably has a chance

1446 :  harriett would not move

1447 :  she was dragged off that bus she was shouting the whole time

1448 :  i didnt know that

1449 :  the law said that a white person couldnt even sit across the aisle from a black person because of the

1450 :  im going to take care of myself i wasnt thinking id be launching a project that would take as of now

1451 :  i want to tell one more story about woody guthrie

1452 :  thats the part the kids dont sing

1453 :  what do you mean

1454 :  the captain says oh i cant do that

1455 :  whats he talking about

1456 :  why arent those men in with the other men

1457 :  so he opened the door and let the black soldiers come in and sing with the white soldiers

1458 :  so in order to paint the portraits i had to spend more time than painting researching reading

1459 :  i hear voices who are those people

1460 :  i dont even know what that means but we seem to wear it like a badge of honor

1461 :  the second one

1462 :  its not about finding a handsome prince

1463 :  when i was in my 20s a really good friend of mine was diagnosed with terminal cancer and i was living away

1464 :  and as we all know there are only two things guaranteed in life

1465 :  i mean he really was just a minor character in all of the fairy tales

1466 :  the reality is in the decade today its not going to cut it

1467 :  you feel good they feel good

1468 :  for me when i first got the job im in at the moment the chancellor came up to me before i started and said

1469 :  she was not looking for anything more than she had

1470 :  but what if we were already given the map to happiness but life got in the way and we forgot

1471 :  i heard of a story recently which i think is a really good depiction of this

1472 :  the first regret

1473 :  theyre more than just myths legends and fables

1474 :  i didnt have the courage to express my feelings and its haunted me ever since

1475 :  its not about making people feel bad to make you feel better because thats only short term

1476 :  and do you know what i blame

1477 :  and secondly its not about being a princess

1478 :  so sometimes trying to force yourself off your path can actually put you onto the wrong

1479 :  but i came home and i saw him shortly before he died

1480 :  they could be so much more if they just considered people around them

1481 :  they were proud about what they did so sometimes we need to stop looking for external validation

1482 :  he was the outcome of happiness not the source

1483 :  it is going to take generations to change

1484 :  have we really just set up these series of expectations for ourselves and whos judging us

1485 :  all i wanted to do is tell him how much i loved him and what an amazing friend he was

1486 :  these are the regrets she hears from her patients at their hour of death

1487 :  if you never think youre going to be happy youre never going to be happy

1488 :  i mean when the prince found the glass slipper cinderella didnt race to the palace demanding to

1489 :  theres a book out at the moment called the five regrets of dying by australian author bronnie ware

1490 :  theyre always miserable its always someone elses fault theyre really confrontational and theyre always the victim

1491 :  she was very very content

1492 :  he said to the fisherman how many fish did you catch

1493 :  if we look at snow white she had to clean the house of seven stinky coal miners and as we all know its hard enough

1494 :  i wish id let myself be happier

1495 :  the evil queen however resorted to poisoning snow white to try and get her happy ending which we

1496 :  they are the oral textbooks of the culture designed to impart wisdom spirituality

1497 :  its got health benefits

1498 :  he said just a few

1499 :  but nowadays there are so many things that we can be so the princess really is an ideology

1500 :  i thought oh my god maybe hes right

1501 :  if we look at cultures around the world every culture reads stories

1502 :  its really nice isnt it

1503 :  the good thing is that smiling actually has some great benefits

1504 :  this organization is a lot bigger than any ive ever worked for maybe i need to be more serious

1505 :  i blame time

1506 :  its about making other people feel comfortable

1507 :  of course i turn up to the work on the first day with this intention to be more serious and by lunchtime i was

1508 :  it lowers anxiety it lowers stress it improves your immune system by increasing your white blood cells

1509 :  although it wasnt something that we were comfortable with as women it was something that we learned and we

1510 :  we all know the self fulfilling prophecy

1511 :  bronnie was a palliative care nurse so these arent her regrets of dying

1512 :  you know this person in the workforce

1513 :  for me i think we may have lost sight of where it all started

1514 :  but im not talking about tangible giving

1515 :  do they think do they feel and if so how

1516 :  these seeds are not being sold

1517 :  more than half will die

1518 :  these are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to other important scientific

1519 :  thats because these insecticide sprays are difficult to find theyre expensive and they dont prevent the insect

1520 :  theres no conventional method

1521 :  farmers there cannot afford the seed

1522 :  lets celebrate scientific innovation and use it

1523 :  for example the seed thats being distributed the flood tolerant rice this is distributed freely

1524 :  but this approach does not work well in bangladesh

1525 :  this is the heroin strategy

1526 :  the reason is that sometimes its the cheapest safest and most effective technology

1527 :  theres no organic method

1528 :  why do we do it this way

1529 :  and this is quite a good way of doing it

1530 :  im also working now with x ray video

1531 :  and im sure those architects are inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature

1532 :  so we have not had that at all with these so called treatments

1533 :  and finally the dsm required that the emotional disturbance should be more than simply an

1534 :  we now have a limited number of symptoms and a high impact on functioning thats required

1535 :  the medical field has a long history of conceptualizing womens reproductive processes as

1536 :  oh thats not who she is

1537 :  theres a general assumption that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme

1538 :  as most commonly defined by psychologists pms involves negative behavioral

1539 :  well i can tell you that treating pms has become a profitable thriving industry

1540 :  let me tell you what i mean by erroneously

1541 :  in two thousand and thirteen midol took in fortyeight million dollars in sales revenue

1542 :  pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed

1543 :  we know theres a strong cultural component to the belief in pms because its nearly unheard of outside of

1544 :  however the financial gain of perpetuating the myth that pms is a common

1545 :  its out of her control

1546 :  when women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones medical protocol requires that

1547 :  instead face head on the fact that this countrys expertise in segregation oppression and racism

1548 :  well i want to give you some dates

1549 :  or rosa parks

1550 :  youve put in the hours youve done it enough and it becomes sort of automatic

1551 :  but when she shows a less monolithic character of herself and ultimately of black women we didnt like that as

1552 :  and he was hanging out with all us younger guys

1553 :  and this guy he was up to a lot of no good

1554 :  at this time were living in the bronx and in the building next to where i lived there was a guy named johnny

1555 :  thats all thats important

1556 :  we kind of see ourselves separate but were very much a part of it

1557 :  and he did spend a lot of time up to no good

1558 :  now i expected him to say something like id be sad id be mad id be angry or something like that

1559 :  daddys got you

1560 :  not you okay not you but you

1561 :  and basically the way this game is played

1562 :  okay you love this

1563 :  they dont want to anymore

1564 :  this game replaces the soaring inspirational video on how dominos uses only the freshest

1565 :  i said whats it about

1566 :  how are they supposed to sit through two hours of not interacting

1567 :  im not going to position this that way at all

1568 :  hey gabes mom what are you doing

1569 :  anytime you challenge yourself to something anything no matter how big or how small and you achieve that thing your

1570 :  how i feel about the things that i do is very important and i want to know im making progress and i want

1571 :  it just depends

1572 :  but its also true that if youre fortyfive you still want challenging you still want the content you want you still want to feel connected to the

1573 :  theyre providing a lot of feedback on the live experience

1574 :  teenagers dont drive the way they used to

1575 :  i dont only want to consume the nuggets youve given me if im really into the thing youre making i want to consume as much of it as

1576 :  if you text my mom right now and youre like

1577 :  and has been very successful very effective instead of fighting with it roll with it and leverage that

1578 :  were at a moment in time in live performance in the creation of content

1579 :  and all that is really cute right

1580 :  they said the research classic millennial stuff

1581 :  now we dont have discipline we have ocd

1582 :  but in practice they want you to give them the entertainment

1583 :  just like you may be a part of a tribe if you really like sondheim musicals

1584 :  how does the live performance industry respond to social media

1585 :  their cares the environment

1586 :  and this is core to gamification

1587 :  they want to come and decide the outcome

1588 :  you know that in the united states four fifths of the population watched broadcast entertainment like a tv show

1589 :  and gamification is the platform well use to make that happen

1590 :  they want to be part of that though theyd like to be more viscerally involved

1591 :  some of you may have seen this amazing google glass game called zombies run

1592 :  so instead of exclusively synthesizing proteins in the cell body what theyve done is to

1593 :  so the probe will bind specifically

1594 :  lets just think about how much protein is in a single cell

1595 :  i confused true jihad with this perversion as presented by the fascist

1596 :  and i thought that was jihad my sacred duty which would be rewarded by god

1597 :  so i became involved in the jihad in afghanistan

1598 :  i wanted to protect the muslim afghan population against the soviet army

1599 :  it has been perverted to mean violent struggle wherever muslims are undergoing difficulties

1600 :  now this sounds a little theoretical but its not so theoretical

1601 :  we will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we dont stabilize the world

1602 :  we have to have a modern concept which fits to the data

1603 :  that is when we get girls in school well get an impact fifteen to twenty years later which is a

1604 :  and there was socio economic problems which are now being solved at a much better scale

1605 :  lets be clear about that

1606 :  they have here singapore

1607 :  they get samsung how can they be a developing country

1608 :  its not about just five years its long term investments

1609 :  but then i hear people saying there is no progress in africa

1610 :  and then they got the aswan dam

1611 :  i have no evidence to prove this to be untrue

1612 :  even if you lock your door time will break inside and rob you off your breath

1613 :  i am here to be a student and a teacher of a course in miracles

1614 :  each woman on the stage today had willingness in some form to make a change and thats why she is who she is today

1615 :  each of us at some point in time and in some way we have chosen that tiny mad idea and as the course says

1616 :  let go of your time clock

1617 :  its an unlearning of the negativity of the lack of the comparing of the separation

1618 :  of course there are many moments when i am disconnected from my truth but i know where to go i sit down on that meditation

1619 :  so ive been up since three am

1620 :  if were not living in that faith then what are we doing

1621 :  when i have that new relationship ill be happy

1622 :  when i have that new pair of shoes ill be happy

1623 :  that moment when all of that anger and that past resentment just disappears it goes away it no longer

1624 :  the holy instant is when an ancient hatred becomes a holy love

1625 :  when we open up to think with love and we allow the voice of our inner guidance system to come forward we

1626 :  and i went to mariane and said how would you suggest i carry this message to my generation

1627 :  the ego wants us to see everyone as separate

1628 :  all we have is eighteen minutes to speak to you

1629 :  the second step is a foregone surrender

1630 :  then we have more health then we have more direction

1631 :  ego works in so many vicious ways

1632 :  then we have more vitality

1633 :  before i came out here on the stage i said some prayers with some of my sisters and we were in the back and i said may all the goddesses of the

1634 :  let go of your plans

1635 :  when we have full faith that we can show up without an outline or we can have full faith that we

1636 :  your money can be stolen

1637 :  sharecropping is what makes the world go round on the eastern plains

1638 :  there was nothing signed

1639 :  our students were able to go on leather couches in a room that we cleaned out and they could take naps on their free time

1640 :  it needs to be important to us to create schools that work better for our kids if we

1641 :  pedagogy first technology second if appropriate

1642 :  this was my school

1643 :  how do i know this

1644 :  he goes to ps3 in staten island new york

1645 :  my son nicolas is nine
1646 :  and the problem is the adults

1647 :  we take the old independent study concept

1648 :  it is relevant meaningful and engaging

1649 :  i did that for years

1650 :  weve documented cases in over one hundred and sixty countries all fifty us states over

1651 :  i mean at first you think these people are bad thats why this is happening

1652 :  why are they scared

1653 :  go to a truck stop late at night or a busy truck stop sit down in a parking lot stare out and watch the parking

1654 :  they can only be produced by slaved labour

1655 :  or go to the nail salon

1656 :  when were looking at child sex trafficking what were basically seeing are repeat runaways and prior victims of

1657 :  first transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the

1658 :  i resolved to give back

1659 :  his style on point

1660 :  and so the senate won in the end

1661 :  what do you call the leader of a republican country

1662 :  we had to calm them down

1663 :  they thought the story was going to get out

1664 :  now when youre an investigative reporter and you make an amazing discovery such as your prime minster can be linked to a

1665 :  they all needed to be housed in a safe and secure location in the cloud

1666 :  so i had to basically spend the last week calming everyone down a bit like a general where youre holding your troops back

1667 :  you can imagine the amount of time theyd spent the amount of resources money spent on this

1668 :  native eyes on native names we called it the idea being who best to tell you who was important to

1669 :  environmental and health crises are global

1670 :  jeff skoll is here

1671 :  they understood what it was like to live in a place like new york city in the 1950s

1672 :  thats a negative interest rate bond

1673 :  we grew up in iowa

1674 :  it cant be done

1675 :  i cannot and i will not pull up the ladder behind me

1676 :  its a preferential option for the poor

1677 :  their aspirations went up

1678 :  are there new ways of thinking about how we can rise to meet these aspirations

1679 :  thank you very much

1680 :  it depends on the quality of the ideas

1681 :  i went to high school i went to college

1682 :  we provided education

1683 :  we will help you do that

1684 :  because if we dont im extremely worried

1685 :  i recognized them

1686 :  and they said well thats a nice thought but its just not cost effective

1687 :  and so what do we do about meeting these aspirations

1688 :  seven cents a kilowatt hour

1689 :  lowest bid twentyfive cents a kilowatt hour for zambia

1690 :  and i said ok thats it right

1691 :  and we argued with the world bank

1692 :  we will make the introductions

1693 :  youve all heard that

1694 :  and so thats what we did

1695 :  we will even provide financing

1696 :  im president of the world bank

1697 :  everywhere aspirations are going up

1698 :  i am your archangel without a halo

1699 :  rolled off my tongue

1700 :  i will sit here on the outside of your church waiting for you to put this marble sinner inside of your church

1701 :  can you breathe now

1702 :  and ive reached the end of my confessions

1703 :  is that why you dont hold me anymore father

1704 :  they dont like lavender and clover

1705 :  you might not know that honey bees arent native to north america

1706 :  theyre from europe

1707 :  they need food as in flowers and they need nesting sights

1708 :  and so we decided to take this case to the supreme court

1709 :  where does it end

1710 :  and there is no ideology that will tell you where your property ends

1711 :  and five or ten years from now when amazon wants to deliver a package over your house to your neighbor from

1712 :  and you have to have someone arbitrate that

1713 :  and im here to argue that this is because capitalism in the modern iteration is largely

1714 :  and this is why its very important to think of american capitalism as an operating system and not as an

1715 :  and indeed thats exactly what happened

1716 :  and the operating system needs to keep up

1717 :  now lets add a little sunshine

1718 :  i will give you one clue

1719 :  sit at home and wait

1720 :  so one is short one is longer and purer

1721 :  but never mind about maxs brain lets talk about your own brain

1722 :  so maybe the brain is a task machine rather than a sensory machine

1723 :  this is actually an illusion

1724 :  in this project we are trying to teach blind individuals to see using music

1725 :  now a blind in this case hamutal also blind from birth will want to enter a

1726 :  or have they changed function

1727 :  but the image that you see in your brain and this is the image that counts changed forever

1728 :  and in sensory augmentation im talking about adding a new ability to the abilities that we already have

1729 :  the answer is actually quite surprising

1730 :  we can see it in the next movie pay attention to the activation which is highlighted in yellow

1731 :  ok so if you managed to do it well done

1732 :  im quite sure somewhere in there it also had peoples keystrokes per minute and toilet

1733 :  those are the seven silver bullets that i found

1734 :  thats why i have decided to have no contracts with my current team members

1735 :  this pilot program has allowed us to demonstrate that its possible to harness the incredible power of

1736 :  one week after we began composting our fifth donor body the temperature inside

1737 :  we believe that access to ecological death care is a human right

1738 :  that planet after all supports our living bodies our whole lives

1739 :  we want to help individuals organizations and down the road municipalities design and build

1740 :  our modern funerary practices are designed to stave off the natural processes that happen to a body after death

1741 :  a lot of weddings at that hotel

1742 :  nobody will ever do this

1743 :  globalization will enter a new era

1744 :  in most countries like in my country france weve told our children that manufacturing had no future

1745 :  most of them are in great difficulties today

1746 :  this creates tensions and serious conflicts

1747 :  lets take fashion retail

1748 :  were then ready to fight for a bigger one

1749 :  indeed we could be forgiven for asking ourselves

1750 :  it was pretty bad

1751 :  to make matters worse being ill made it hard for me to write songs

1752 :  so why did i go back

1753 :  it will explain everything

1754 :  i was only called one name all day it wasnt that bad

1755 :  he said that in front of the whole family

1756 :  but it definitely didnt do that

1757 :  you may well have heard that a decrease in seasonal sea ice is causing loss of habitat for animals that rely

1758 :  the ice too make sounds

1759 :  everyone who studies public speaking puts that speech in their list

1760 :  every single person ive worked with has the ability in their own way to break through

1761 :  it brings us all together

1762 :  they have a conversation with

1763 :  thats not what great speakers do

1764 :  so why are we telling you all of this

1765 :  i would frequently be beckoned mr

1766 :  jordanians have larger families than we tend to have in this country very common to have

1767 :  and david was able to go along on these trips with me so we were able to explore and

1768 :  it also does health education and secondary health care

1769 :  they know that

1770 :  we were also able to meet more people because the women who come from the university are

1771 :  with more contacts that were able to make we can find out what other

1772 :  whats the value in it for you

1773 :  kennedy and has operated over the last fiftyfour years in well over one hundred
1774 :  for us it was a very important part of our lives that we treasure

1775 :  old human blood i didnt show you does not have this effect it does not make the mice younger

1776 :  now i dont think we will live forever

1777 :  and so we have to figure out how they balance those two things

1778 :  how they got to where they are may be important in shaping the input information but once we know

1779 :  how about ten times

1780 :  and this is exactly what we are doing we are putting together dots

1781 :  so even though we can still do quite a lot and learn a lot of information from these blurry pixelated

1782 :  so in fact we work with very special fluorescent labels that we can by exciting them with

1783 :  but now i want to speak about this problem

1784 :  so you want to study each virus one at a time

1785 :  this was popular in the 1800s and really talented painters could paint these

1786 :  so we are actually following the motion of the virus inside the cell

1787 :  and these things are really small

1788 :  and i hope i was able to show you that we are getting closer and closer to that dream

1789 :  and fluorescent labels work best for these

1790 :  and people still wonder why there are boys rotting they go away in high school hallways they are afraid of

1791 :  called me by a name i did not recognize said lesbian but i was more boy than girl more ken than

1792 :  it had nothing to do with hating my body i just love it enough to let it go i treat it like a house and when your

1793 :  and i swallowed their insults along with their slurs

1794 :  that was the prevailing story in the media

1795 :  we need to ask that question we need to have a good answer to that question

1796 :  now were not gonna visit any of those planets in my lifetime

1797 :  i dont know

1798 :  i dont exactly walk around with one hundred and thirtyfive billion dollars in my wallet

1799 :  and then they go on to become a geneticist or a computer scientist or an app developer or whatever it is i think

1800 :  probably not in my childrens lifetime but some day we will

1801 :  i dont know what else you could do with that money

1802 :  thats a game changer

1803 :  in fact im so overwhelmed that i cannot put that number into context

1804 :  and thats because the water protected the basin from being impacted by asteroids and

1805 :  and yes its all scripted by the way even this relaxed off the cuff bit has been peer

1806 :  we have access to 4g tablets smartphones laptops

1807 :  were projecting a version of ourselves onto the internet

1808 :  so there is no traditional bullying rota where you go home at night and

1809 :  which again technical term for something thats not that technical

1810 :  i think by now we can all agree and confidently answer that the future its

1811 :  so at the same time i would like to stress that society needs to reevaluate its perception of youth

1812 :  we need to fundamentally change that image

1813 :  and it works

1814 :  and it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation

1815 :  and he was walking around

1816 :  the next issue that resolved was that if ninety percent of head and neck pain is caused by

1817 :  the audience is too small

1818 :  i dont know what i had in my mind

1819 :  but they asked one question

1820 :  he had a lovely sense of humor too

1821 :  i chose to design a column

1822 :  would they surprise us

1823 :  and in doing so we can suddenly fold anything

1824 :  so i kept doing this

1825 :  and the answer to that question is no of course not

1826 :  i felt so bad for these french people

1827 :  how did they cope with such little storage space

1828 :  youre not going to be prone to impulse buys anymore

1829 :  they werent expensive but they were the nicest pyjamas id ever owned as an adult because they were actually meant to

1830 :  and it wasnt a closet like i was used to back in california

1831 :  so i observed madame chic of course i observed the other mothers on the study abroad program i observed

1832 :  i decided to observe them

1833 :  youre going to be more discerning

1834 :  so extras can be things like t shirts sweaters obviously if you live in a cold climate youll need lots of layering

1835 :  and it turns out they did

1836 :  men you have less choice its easier for you

1837 :  it was one of the first times i realized i could respect myself enough to present myself beautifully at all

1838 :  so we are more prone to impulse buys

1839 :  youre thinking theres no way

1840 :  ill dress as neo from the matrix

1841 :  i made a lot of my own toys

1842 :  im thinking are you kidding

1843 :  and were making it our own

1844 :  im wearing a suit of armor

1845 :  i was way too young to see it but i was caught up in jaws fever like everyone else in america at the time

1846 :  maybe they want to keep growing but man s too ignorant to stop mowing so lawns are cut each

1847 :  she can open a can of soda she can she has many talents she can chug the can of soda and then she can

1848 :  or put a poem up on the screen and have us translate it only problem is the poem would be in a language

1849 :  everyone has a smartphone and what theyre doing is remixing mashing up and then spitting back

1850 :  well close up on an emotion on a characters face the protagonist begin to pull back as the music

1851 :  always that erotic murmur im hardly myself if im not in a state of

1852 :  i dont mean that for a moment

1853 :  my ignorant arrogant coarseness my secret pride my turning

1854 :  i like a lot of black colors a lot of grays and stuff like that

1855 :  we do not pretend that their crime never happened

1856 :  here is why this matters

1857 :  fewer than twenty are considered to be irredeemable sociopaths

1858 :  i said xavi what do you mean

1859 :  and if we could match that with his speech and what he was telling us when he was speaking how much better would we

1860 :  it meant that i didnt have to worry about if you dont want me to know something that is secretive and

1861 :  thats the next question

1862 :  i want us all to be agents of change

1863 :  my name is jessica and today i want to tell you about my crazy experiments into

1864 :  i cant think of another food source that could have this kind of impact on both the environment and the global economy

1865 :  to help foster that cultural change im starting with the cricket

1866 :  in their direst estimates beef will be priced like caviar

1867 :  by the year two thousand and fifty there will be an additional two billion people on the planet and economists say that we

1868 :  economists say that by the year two thousand and fifty meat will become a luxury product

1869 :  in my previous life before i started bitty foods i was a trend forecaster and consumer

1870 :  i remember one young man

1871 :  and he was angry

1872 :  and its ok and when i feel like rubbish im really going to embrace that rubbish feeling im probably going to get into bed im going to watch

1873 :  ah there we go

1874 :  violence is everywhere

1875 :  good morning everyone

1876 :  im now fortynine years old

1877 :  i used to say i own a general construction company

1878 :  thats how i deal with all the negative in my life

1879 :  you know what

1880 :  im twentyfive years out there as a general contractor

1881 :  i lived a very colourful life

1882 :  whats a panic attack

1883 :  im not advocating for teenagers to have sex

1884 :  shortology became a project of thirteen books hundreds of stories characters

1885 :  we wanted to create something which could help anyone to express ideas

1886 :  from rock drawings in caves dating back thousands of years to the latest iphone

1887 :  which was funding geigers clinic found out about this they were furious

1888 :  i have no idea where the nearest food pantry is

1889 :  they will be used to realize our aspiration

1890 :  so we thought if we can get individual doctors to prescribe these basic resources for their patients

1891 :  and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income

1892 :  if we know what it takes to have a healthcare system rather than a sick care system why dont we

1893 :  and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose

1894 :  my belief is that its almost too painful to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system or

1895 :  same thing in the clinic waiting room

1896 :  the real issue is that child is living with twelve other people in a two bedroom apartment

1897 :  health just takes more time

1898 :  barry zuckerman was doing as chair of pediatrics at boston medical center

1899 :  and we always won because the judges were just so grossed out

1900 :  and when the office of economic opportunity in washington d

1901 :  you must pursue that vision

1902 :  but in my world its called reduced obesity and diabetes

1903 :  and this isnt just a sort of short term workforce to connect patients to basic resources its a next

1904 :  so health leads was born of these conversations a simple model where doctors and nurses can

1905 :  so i have spent hours upon hours trying to make sense of this weird groundhog day

1906 :  but he hasnt paid his rent of course because hes paying for his hiv medication and just cant afford both

1907 :  do they have transportation to the pharmacy

1908 :  those are the questions i learned at health leads not in medical school

1909 :  i just wanted a blessing i didnt want some kind of mandate

1910 :  so on the one hand this is just a basic recoding of the electronic medical record

1911 :  so its a brutal winter in the northeast your kid has asthma your heat just got turned off and of course youre in the waiting room of the

1912 :  it requires a non clinical army of community health workers and case managers and many

1913 :  so our feeling is if its good enough for the rugby team its good enough for health and poverty

1914 :  the problem is once you get a taste of what its like to realize your aspiration for healthcare you want

1915 :  the doctors it seemed never really had enough time for all the patients try as they might

1916 :  these things are ours

1917 :  the average ncaa division i mens basketball player dedicates thirtynine hours a week to

1918 :  geiger i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history

1919 :  that if we are honest with ourselves and listen quietly that we all

1920 :  but over the course of these nine months i grew frustrated with feeling like we were intervening too far

1921 :  so thats where health leads began

1922 :  and on the other hand its a radical transformation of the electronic medical record from a

1923 :  its just a set of choices that people make

1924 :  this aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy is an enormously powerful one

1925 :  weve created a presumption that if youre a patient at that hospital with an elevated bmi the four walls of the

1926 :  we had moms who would come in daughter has asthma wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning

1927 :  they will be used for our purposes

1928 :  here we are fortyfive years after geiger has prescribed food for his patients and i have

1929 :  and they leave with the conviction the ability and the efficacy to realize our most basic

1930 :  you need more

1931 :  college sports teams say were going to take dozens of hours at some field across campus at some

1932 :  and one of our litigation strategies was actually to send me into the home of these clients with these large glass

1933 :  so just a few miles from here at childrens national medical center

1934 :  guess what day

1935 :  what matters to me is that they are bright and kind and feminist and laugh at my jokes

1936 :  so why is that a problem

1937 :  for others it means

1938 :  i finally got these cards

1939 :  i think gender is multidimensional and complex

1940 :  think of the box you check off on a form thats identity

1941 :  for some people bisexuality means

1942 :  if youre a lesbian or a heterosexual man you might say im attracted only to women

1943 :  on a quiet gentle boy

1944 :  and if like me you prefer your rugged outdoor adventure tempered by a nice hot shower and a conversation with friends at

1945 :  there is one camp that loves carnivores and wants them protected without end forever and ever all of

1946 :  they were kind of blurry and kind of grouchy and i suggested to them that they must really kind of hate the

1947 :  but if you kill all the wolves there is no more power there is no more luck and ultimately there is no more

1948 :  when bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up she brought the medical team over to our

1949 :  all of thats great and i dont denigrate it

1950 :  and the hypothermia sets in

1951 :  i didnt give up

1952 :  there was action behind these words

1953 :  youve never seen black this black

1954 :  but it was deeper

1955 :  on the beach

1956 :  i just went into thinking about this dream and why and how

1957 :  itll always be part of us

1958 :  and well never forget it

1959 :  it says you go ahead

1960 :  the whole thing i just thought in my hallucinatory moment that i heard the word tracheotomy

1961 :  and theres no doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today

1962 :  thats always there and its undeniable

1963 :  i didnt do it

1964 :  and id like to take just a few minutes to explain to you why

1965 :  well its been twentyfive years since they arrested a pot smoker in the netherlands and what they found after twentyfive years is

1966 :  smell this cheese

1967 :  a few years ago i was due for a vacation

1968 :  it smells like the feet of angels

1969 :  cut glass peaks against that blue sky

1970 :  youre in iran anytime somethings frustrating to us and out of our control we say death to that

1971 :  well in the adulthood you realize

1972 :  you need to go there and meet these people

1973 :  why are you going to iran

1974 :  in europe theyve got the same victimless crime issues and they have different approaches to them

1975 :  one thousand four hundred years ago mohammed said

1976 :  and i want to know that cause i want to empathize with that cause

1977 :  iran has got baggage and we need to understand that if were going to deal with them smartly

1978 :  thats the mark of a good trip

1979 :  im a dervish thats like a monk that follows mevlana thats sort of a teacher in islam

1980 :  well you know they grew up with the shah on the throne

1981 :  ive got a good friend in switzerland whos a school teacher in a little traditional village where almost everybody has the same last

1982 :  and if i am making a tour or a guidebook or a tv show and i am not connecting people with people i am kind of nervous because

1983 :  you already have

1984 :  bulgarians have the bulgarian dream

1985 :  now appreciating the value of travel is nothing new

1986 :  and ill tell you

1987 :  i just love turkey and as a tour guide i had the chance to take a group to get to know a whirling dervish

1988 :  and i whirl and i whirl and i lose myself in that transe thinking of the teachings of mevlana

1989 :  she did one of those little point on my chest things she said

1990 :  a great sort of learning area wading pool for world exploration to me is europe

1991 :  my friends in europe always remind me

1992 :  just say no

1993 :  in other words its helped me to become a better citizen of this planet

1994 :  i knew this dervish and i asked him

1995 :  when i am traveling i find that there are different slices of culture that i never realized people could be

1996 :  a society has to make a choice tolerate alternative life styles or build more prisons

1997 :  why do americans have such soft bread

1998 :  and ahead of me i hear the long legato tones of an alphorn announcing that the helicopter stocked mountain hut is open

1999 :  thank you very much

2000 :  i was heading for mazatl n and i was just needy for a nice stretch of pristine beach swept free of

2001 :  i want to know what makes them tick

2002 :  an easy one is

2003 :  it doesnt diminish ours but its really important for us to remember in our travels that there are other heroes

2004 :  its a thriving country of seventy million people

2005 :  a present day nathan hale

2006 :  norwegians have the norwegian dream

2007 :  and for thirty years ive had the poor reaching in my window

2008 :  to be there as tour guide with my group watching him his head tilted over his robe then goes out and he loses

2009 :  i said yeah

2010 :  i think its interesting when you go to scandinavia how many drunk teenagers you find on decorated trucks

2011 :  i thought well have i ever said damn something

2012 :  to demonstrate how this works up lewis why dont you come up

2013 :  were going to do this hand model of the brain and im going to teach you all how to do this

2014 :  so these are the kinds of things we need to really think deeply about

2015 :  and thats the basis of the emotional intelligence actually and its the basis as youll see in the moment of social

2016 :  so how did mr

2017 :  some people call that the head brain some people just call it the brain but actually you have a brain around your heart

2018 :  the brainstems are also going to have the fight flight freeze reaction

2019 :  theres all sorts of layers to it and it makes maps to the outside world

2020 :  rogers had for all of us and teach not only reading writing arithmetic very important three rs

2021 :  thats basically the biological understanding of what we mean by the nervous system

2022 :  this brain sits in your body we are going to talk about the brain and the body

2023 :  lets do the hand model

2024 :  we have a team

2025 :  there is one pathologist for every case

2026 :  while staying true and keeping those classics alive we can build and create new classics and a bright future for

2027 :  arthur mitchell of course was the principal dancer with new york city ballet the first black man

2028 :  dolores browne the new york negro ballet in the 50s

2029 :  she danced at the metropolitan opera

2030 :  lack of diversity

2031 :  finding out that african americans have a rich history in the ballet world was an incredible discovery for me

2032 :  so i think its so important for us to know every side of the history of classical

2033 :  it was something that i did with a former nfl player

2034 :  story ballets are the most classic within the ballet repertory

2035 :  allowing new choreographers the space without judgement to create we could very well have another

2036 :  so i think that we are getting back to that point now with our generation with a different

2037 :  this was really cool

2038 :  so let me explain these things

2039 :  this is stuff we take for granted today

2040 :  does that mean theres nothing to worry about

2041 :  now i started this talk with a paradox

2042 :  there will be jobs

2043 :  why are there so few farmers today

2044 :  why doesnt that make our labor superfluous our skills redundant

2045 :  many of the industries in which we now work

2046 :  today its less than two percent

2047 :  and the house that i had spent time in was empty

2048 :  and her eyes were bloodshot and she seemed to be in shock

2049 :  people were lying on the floor

2050 :  but i was off on assignment

2051 :  can i get her to a hospital

2052 :  would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow

2053 :  i was very worried about her

2054 :  were going to die from the smoke

2055 :  i want to go back and talk to her

2056 :  i had a sleeping bag

2057 :  we really need to relax about this

2058 :  what do i mean by that

2059 :  okay so thats number one

2060 :  im going to tell you what we have learned

2061 :  its just different names

2062 :  we were outside it was late at night and we were wondering where we were going we were lost

2063 :  number two what im going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them

2064 :  and we wonder why these biases dont die and move from generation to generation

2065 :  like i dont think this is going to work for me

2066 :  i mean its the same story

2067 :  i mean you just have to do it

2068 :  that means theyre totally out of sync in traditional classes which are analog static interactively passive

2069 :  its a social awkwardness like youre a stranger in a foreign land

2070 :  drugs you want more of the same different

2071 :  the old shyness was a fear of rejection

2072 :  how can i stay motivated

2073 :  ill say this

2074 :  thank you very much

2075 :  my work was incredible i loved it

2076 :  nobody wants to hear somebody say that

2077 :  in that moment everybody allowed themselves to be seen they were vulnerable

2078 :  how can i get motivated

2079 :  they were all incredibly experiences the people i worked with they inspired me

2080 :  i said alright sarah tell me whats going on

2081 :  so i sat sarah down right in front of me

2082 :  everybody talked about something they had achieved something that was a challenge in their life

2083 :  this is bad

2084 :  because of those chemicals

2085 :  what happens next right

2086 :  and all of a sudden people started to open up

2087 :  he was very confused and i could tell

2088 :  this happened for weeks and then finally we got to the point where we its like were going to have to get a therapist involved

2089 :  its exactly what im talking about

2090 :  cisco is an amazing company they create cutting edge technology but what makes them so great and they understand this

2091 :  and it was really funny

2092 :  you know inspiration its when were not trying to became inspired that we are inspired

2093 :  somethings up with my son

2094 :  i want to make sure that i spend quality time with them

2095 :  ive learned as much about it as i can

2096 :  its often called the theory of mind and it is incredibly difficult to show that animals have such a thing

2097 :  everyone wants to express themselves

2098 :  who cares why things are creepy

2099 :  they just are

2100 :  i mean whats the point

2101 :  im going to call that extractive economic institutions

2102 :  it stopped people from copying his idea

2103 :  and that created incentives for people to innovate

2104 :  i dont like your face

2105 :  to undermine the strong state

2106 :  does greece have politicians like that

2107 :  i am going to talk about why nations fail and why nations succeed as well which is really

2108 :  let me say that there is something else and thats whats going on in mexico in north korea and zimbabwe

2109 :  and through owning a monopoly a telecommunications monopoly

2110 :  how does greece fit into this

2111 :  and if you think about both of these examples both of these elements come in

2112 :  i mean come on

2113 :  so how come the united states ended up like that

2114 :  the way im talking now is sort of politics

2115 :  or how come mexico is like that

2116 :  were just friends

2117 :  one of the things that surprised me most in my research though is how changeable attitudes actually are

2118 :  a hundred years ago we tended to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia that if they took hold would take us away

2119 :  we now tend to die of cancer and heart disease and what that means is that many of us will have a long period of

2120 :  and why is that

2121 :  you really reduce congestion quite substantially

2122 :  but well as i said i mean car drivers adapt right

2123 :  someone must control all of this

2124 :  so why can that be

2125 :  i mean think about how different cities are actually

2126 :  no one is in charge

2127 :  its because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think

2128 :  each day people make new decisions and people change and the world changes around them and each day all of

2129 :  now this information comes from the center for disease control in the united states

2130 :  and i worry that we dont give enough attention to that

2131 :  im madeleine maceda heide im the assistant superintendent for the american school of bombay

2132 :  what im concerned about is the effect it has on the growing brain

2133 :  remember were talking about developing brains here

2134 :  now dont get me wrong

2135 :  im delighted to present such a knowledgeable incredible educator to enlighten us about this important

2136 :  but there are also other things that can cause a distraction that can cause us to look like were not paying

2137 :  and then you turn toward that noise to see whether or not the cause of is going to be a problem

2138 :  and i wouldnt be surprised if there are a lot of those products right here as well

2139 :  so what happens is when you get too much caffeine in your body if youve ever had too much

2140 :  please welcome dr

2141 :  so thats another one to watch for

2142 :  five million children

2143 :  children can be under all kinds of stress

2144 :  for parents and educators adhd poses complex questions of how best to serve

2145 :  so theyre spending that much more time connected to their outside world than to their inside world where they should

2146 :  i know my parents did

2147 :  whats happening today is they dont have that conversation very often

2148 :  so my whole purpose here today is to say

2149 :  well why is this

2150 :  its something all of us can relate to

2151 :  no longer is our work something that we merely endure

2152 :  i asked my employers to donate all my wages to charity

2153 :  well great but industrial agriculture for all of its ills surely at least the one thing it has is that its more efficient

2154 :  it must be because organic farming is more expensive right

2155 :  well so maybe organic farming saves money but perhaps it produces less food

2156 :  the leading exporter of pork in the world today is denmark

2157 :  this is an approximation this is not very exact math

2158 :  feed the world

2159 :  the general u

2160 :  you must be thinking

2161 :  this is not a blanket statement it varies by crop and region but there are lot of ways in which when done right

2162 :  were not even average

2163 :  thats not efficient its incredibly wasteful

2164 :  about twenty people of color fifteen hispanic and about six out of ten shop at walmart

2165 :  i put my own money where my mouth is and ive invested a lot of money in farmland lp as i mentioned which is converting

2166 :  for example think about the topsoil

2167 :  denmark is a country that has for many years banned the use of sub therapeutic antibiotics in livestock

2168 :  who in america is buying it

2169 :  its being imported

2170 :  for one thing chipotle which is the closest we have to a fast food organic company is the single fastest

2171 :  thats how much has actually been consumed

2172 :  whats the most efficient way to produce food if people are going to eat more meat

2173 :  instead were mining minerals in morroco shipping them across the atlantic spraying them on the fields only to

2174 :  im afraid that its now going to be taken away

2175 :  and he was an irish immigrant

2176 :  because it is their hard work their courage and that door was open for them

2177 :  and then my parents were the same way

2178 :  and i am so afraid of what is going to happen in my future

2179 :  where do they come from

2180 :  they didnt graduate from college

2181 :  her name was anna

2182 :  it is not lost on me every single day that i get up and i walk into my

2183 :  i am not saying we do not need hotels or traditional forms of authority

2184 :  so the economist eloquently described the blockchain as the great chain of being

2185 :  i would get a bad reputation and you would refuse to do business with me in the future

2186 :  you can open your eyes now

2187 :  thats one hundred and twentyseven rides per second showing that this is a cross cultural

2188 :  does the way we build trust face to face translate online

2189 :  im on this big red circle

2190 :  so picture this

2191 :  instead they relish the challenge and enjoy solving the riddle of how to get their robot better with each

2192 :  things like what

2193 :  you know what theyre even going to vary within individuals

2194 :  remember that long term memories take time

2195 :  i believe in time very important

2196 :  and i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside

2197 :  a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life bloods flow

2198 :  you and i know deeper down theres always a chance to win the crown

2199 :  but when we fail to give our best we simply havent met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really

2200 :  if you make the effort to do the best of which youre capable trying to improve the situation that exists for you i think thats

2201 :  so i wanted to come up with something of my own

2202 :  i believed in that

2203 :  id learned these prior to coming to ucla and i decided they were very important

2204 :  not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no

2205 :  im paid to do it

2206 :  i believe thats true

2207 :  what would you want

2208 :  i didnt want that

2209 :  its bearing down that wins the cup

2210 :  webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something

2211 :  have i rambled enough

2212 :  i can never answer that

2213 :  its you and i who make our fates we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road

2214 :  i used to say that when a game is over and you see somebody that didnt know the outcome i hope they couldnt

2215 :  but im here with a message of hope

2216 :  my plan of coming to the united states to pursue graduate studies at ucla became my ticket to escape the

2217 :  in two thousand and fourteen twentyfour year old bassil da costa had never been to one of these protests before

2218 :  and the shortage of medicine and basic care supplies are the number one cause of death in the

2219 :  we are very welcoming and just like the united states venezuela is a country of

2220 :  i felt the same intense call for social justice at the memorial service for heather when her mother

2221 :  the healthcare system is also collapsing

2222 :  but with the love and support of my local community who gave me and my business a vote of confidence i

2223 :  as jared diamond and others have shown us this is how civilizations commit suicide

2224 :  by the way tony hayward the former ceo of bp had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this

2225 :  we should value that as an athletic activity in and of itself and nothing to how it compares to people without

2226 :  i think its time for the subject to go public

2227 :  what do people think about it

2228 :  then the question is can you reassemble with that genome the whole bird

2229 :  where would you start

2230 :  you know do you want extinct species back

2231 :  well youd start by finding out if the biotech is really there

2232 :  it happened to lots of mammals

2233 :  i said that charitable giving is two percent of gdp in the united states

2234 :  this created a real problem for these people

2235 :  there are a lot of problems with this question

2236 :  and if you think about it how could one sector possibly take market share away from another sector if it

2237 :  but it doesnt seem to be working

2238 :  who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if its tiny

2239 :  weve all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead is morally superior to the professional fundraising

2240 :  well put you on the cover of wired magazine

2241 :  but only about twenty percent of that or sixty billion dollars goes to health and human services causes

2242 :  and social business needs markets and there are some issues for which you just cant develop the kind of money measures that you need for a

2243 :  so in your companies you cant keep track of every individual invoice and so you have to

2244 :  i know that its the only one

2245 :  jaitley to announce it in the budget as did many other people

2246 :  thats what ive learned from my experience and also from a big idea that was implemented which is

2247 :  thats lots and lots of jobs

2248 :  im sure you guys are aware of the trials

2249 :  its been discussed for a long time

2250 :  and his proof point was so powerful that after he did that a generation of pilots after him

2251 :  real time data

2252 :  and the answer is no by no means

2253 :  thats of course a big big promise

2254 :  how to make it happen

2255 :  and so you can say

2256 :  and this energy is released just by speed by kinetic energy by heat in other

2257 :  but i will also ask the question

2258 :  and this big promise has driven mankind for fifty years already to explore how it can work

2259 :  and so thats a fantastic fuel

2260 :  the machine runs perfectly fine

2261 :  its a conversion of mass into energy and thats einsteins famous formula e mc

2262 :  i think that will be a major breakthrough and then we have a new primary energy source and i should

2263 :  but i said no

2264 :  im not a victim anymore

2265 :  first my book painful hope

2266 :  you might get more calm

2267 :  and all of us will benefit

2268 :  some of the worst issues of our time are connected to it

2269 :  and fresh water planet earth has a very limited supply

2270 :  so for instance when being person b in such a trust game we think

2271 :  but what we forget then is that most other persons b would experience exactly the same feelings and for that reason they would

2272 :  trustful people are perceived to be warm and competent and distrustful people are perceived to

2273 :  and the results always looked very similar

2274 :  if person b turns out to be trustworthy youve made ten euros out of your five

2275 :  so i swam through the night and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots

2276 :  they were prepared

2277 :  and by the way a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was august 22nd

2278 :  and there are all kinds of problems

2279 :  its fourteen hours fiftyeight minutes

2280 :  so that was at eight oclock at night

2281 :  and he is down

2282 :  and i want to live every day of the rest of my life that way swim or no swim

2283 :  i can feel proud

2284 :  who cares the last two minutes

2285 :  and this time i dont like it i didnt want to give into it but theres a difference between a non stop

2286 :  and when i started in with the eight hours and the ten hours and the twelve hours and the fourteen hours and the fifteen
2287 :  if i get stung ill just grin and bear it

2288 :  but can you actually drive it down to zero

2289 :  agencies and many humanitarian and other organizations that came and joined the fight to try and stop

2290 :  but what had to be done there was slightly different

2291 :  but what we saw was something very different

2292 :  but how did ebola end up in lofa county in the first place

2293 :  and we saw the u

2294 :  there was so much disease they approached it differently

2295 :  this time it was in nigeria in the teeming metropolis of lagos twentyone million

2296 :  and for this reason they were deeply disturbed deeply alarmed and the entire epidemic was unraveling

2297 :  learn where your food is coming from

2298 :  and understand the impacts of what you eat

2299 :  it was quite difficult

2300 :  but have you ever stopped to think where is this food coming from

2301 :  chicken fish turkey pork and beef

2302 :  but i hope ive given you some food for thought

2303 :  but turns out my blood levels were the best theyve ever been in a long time

2304 :  id see pizza and needed to have it

2305 :  it took time to understand what i needed to consume daily

2306 :  but now over fifty percent are fruits and vegetables

2307 :  when i ate everything and anything less than twenty to thirty percent of my diet was fruits and vegetables

2308 :  just going to show that going vegan was a choice that i will forever stand by

2309 :  if you have a dog or a cat please raise your hand

2310 :  but plenty of people can argue that veganism isnt healthy because well oreos are vegan frosted

2311 :  what exactly am i eating and putting into my body

2312 :  what is it for

2313 :  to compare from one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight to two thousand and fourteen there have been five hundred and fortyeight fatal shark attacks as said

2314 :  little chicks are thrown into grinders alive

2315 :  but when someone eats there are so many factors that contribute to what goes into their bodies

2316 :  but my daily calories are mostly vegetables fruits carbs and proteins while consuming very little fats

2317 :  we have this very literal way of thinking of when i do certain amount of work i do it for certain amount of money

2318 :  i thought this is great

2319 :  this is really gonna work

2320 :  they want something that makes a statement

2321 :  and its a very simple thing to do

2322 :  its human nature right

2323 :  but the biggest thing i learned is you have to do the right kind of market research okay

2324 :  its fantastic go for it

2325 :  and thats the case for most people nowadays

2326 :  i do sometimes but its very rare i normally use my mobile phone or my laptop or

2327 :  so it just makes sense that the more people you know the more chance you have of your name being in that kind of

2328 :  and that can be money of course it can be money

2329 :  in case this is one of those big grand statements that we used to hear when we were younger

2330 :  i dont really use my watch to tell the time

2331 :  what do i mean by soundscape

2332 :  in the spring it can be a cacophony of sound

2333 :  thank you so much for sharing

2334 :  think of the number of blind people

2335 :  you hear the traffic

2336 :  it was ironic because i was a guy talking everyday about reducing peoples reliance on diesel awarded

2337 :  now here is what i do to fill out the ballot

2338 :  and i think a word that theyre watching right now is yolo

2339 :  and one of the ways they can be troublesome is that theyre changing meaning

2340 :  or do you find it fun

2341 :  that word might be slangy that word might be informal that word might be a word that you think is illogical

2342 :  and then they stop talking

2343 :  im going to do this as a show of hands

2344 :  we can give you a sense of the range of opinions about contested usage

2345 :  to show you what i mean well look at an example

2346 :  i hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome

2347 :  language just doesnt work that way

2348 :  again a show of hands

2349 :  are you bothered by language fads and language change

2350 :  when people meet me at parties and they find out that im an english professor who specializes in

2351 :  well you know what

2352 :  so theyre over there theyre far away

2353 :  let me google that oh my god

2354 :  ten million hits

2355 :  so america had a mid 20th century that was really bipartisan

2356 :  and if you value having a generous welfare state youve got to emphasize that were all the same

2357 :  its harder to find somebody whos on the other side

2358 :  look he was

2359 :  i can put myself in your shoes

2360 :  diversity and immigration do a lot of good things

2361 :  empathy is traditionally framed as oh i feel your pain

2362 :  they were quitting jobs they didnt like

2363 :  if you wanted a first aider or an expert in fire extinguishers there was steve or andy

2364 :  and of course the dying of community in an age where direct communication has been

2365 :  we dont really need much from anyone

2366 :  so we engage less

2367 :  sometimes even being made redundant

2368 :  i want that checked

2369 :  we come in with this capability of being present with ourselves at all times

2370 :  and in that space i sense my creativity my authenticity and my own agency

2371 :  but anyone whos ever raised a child played with a child nurtured a child or taught a child

2372 :  being with ourselves and being with each other

2373 :  i am going to imagine that is the same for each of you

2374 :  perhaps you will feel the same

2375 :  i wanted to share it with you today because those essential things are what id like to talk with you about

2376 :  and if i dont look rich beautiful and american am i still a woman

2377 :  most of you agreed with me

2378 :  it sucks but it is what it is

2379 :  they just are

2380 :  things men in this country arent really allowed to do

2381 :  passing as a natural woman can decide whether i have a good day or a bad day

2382 :  and is it bad if we want to do something about that make a couple of changes

2383 :  not all of you however

2384 :  thirty five years after the publication of the transsexual empire

2385 :  they just work

2386 :  men who judge us to be not femme enough

2387 :  because men are scary pigs and patriarchy is real

2388 :  i stopped cutting my hair

2389 :  the thesis of this text is essentially that

2390 :  i wore dresses to morning classes

2391 :  as improvisers we train ourselves to listen wholly to listen with the willingness to

2392 :  have you heard of this

2393 :  we do stupid things

2394 :  but thats what happens when we are afraid right

2395 :  can we do this multiple times a day

2396 :  can we wake up

2397 :  but not just everyday

2398 :  i saw that it was not about just transmitting knowledge it was about giving a new

2399 :  together with prof

2400 :  one student was asking

2401 :  its not a question of feelings

2402 :  well as it turns out i am in a good company

2403 :  it took years until i really got it

2404 :  some people want to get rich some want to get famous

2405 :  i love having adventures because i love feeling free

2406 :  its very difficult to sound menacing

2407 :  that doesnt mean drunken teens vomiting up and screaming yolo

2408 :  i love people who are up for stuff and spontaneity

2409 :  if only so im united with bex

2410 :  the situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation of

2411 :  what is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age

2412 :  such makeshift settlements are considered illegal and therefore those living in them dont have a

2413 :  it is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience

2414 :  files appeared on the network including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission which

2415 :  and people did communicate

2416 :  the right of assembly and the right to demonstrate are restricted there

2417 :  but they arent a commercial enterprise

2418 :  this is essential to overcome our speechlessness and the separation provoked by rival political forces

2419 :  we have european passports visas and air tickets

2420 :  over fifteen thousand messages were sent

2421 :  they are all about providing basic information weather forecasts legal information guidance

2422 :  we are used to invitations but this invitation really thrilled us

2423 :  information on the internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored and the

2424 :  and potentially changing the material geometry of this object in order to increase its strength

2425 :  student ryan schmidt

2426 :  thats a terrible outcome for two reasons

2427 :  they get about halfway through the process

2428 :  thats about our timeline

2429 :  and then due to the contingencies of a subsistence life they are forced to leave

2430 :  and in fact our project kind of fits within some of that logic is well the idea of using this emerging

2431 :  theyve been there for a couple of days

2432 :  now i coined a term in two thousand and seven called critical making and ive been studying

2433 :  weve gone from john beat mary to mary was beaten by john

2434 :  its unbelievable really

2435 :  and let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy

2436 :  so the question is what are we doing here in our society and in the world

2437 :  but when you get into it you realize there are pressures on men

2438 :  theres been an awful lot of silence

2439 :  and a lot of people when they hear the word gender think it means women

2440 :  so one of the ways that we can use the spotlight is to thank women and honor womens leadership going forward

2441 :  what about all those boys

2442 :  this is all unconscious

2443 :  i know theres more than men and women theres more than male and female

2444 :  theres some confusion about the term gender

2445 :  theres a whole spectrum

2446 :  but on a big scale we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues

2447 :  in fact im going to argue that these are mens issues first and foremost

2448 :  theres no question about it

2449 :  you know what

2450 :  but we also owe it to our sons

2451 :  not just women and girls but also men and boys

2452 :  theres been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of mens violence against women and children

2453 :  they didnt make the choice

2454 :  by the way we owe it to women

2455 :  im using the gender binary

2456 :  but how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse

2457 :  thats a good english sentence

2458 :  why was she drinking with those guys in that hotel room

2459 :  why do they keep going back

2460 :  other people will say well get off it

2461 :  adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues because when somebody speaks up in a

2462 :  just like with heterosexism if youre a heterosexual person and you yourself dont enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards

2463 :  well see a radical diminution of the abuse

2464 :  because ultimately the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or

2465 :  so thats something that both women and men have in common

2466 :  how does all this work

2467 :  what do we do

2468 :  i know we can do it we can do better

2469 :  how do we support our friends

2470 :  we know enough to know that we can easily do that

2471 :  because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted

2472 :  its almost like a chip in our brain is activated and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the

2473 :  we hear about it all the time

2474 :  he needs leadership training because hes being a bad leader because in a society with gender diversity and

2475 :  my argument is he doesnt need sensitivity training

2476 :  how do we speak up

2477 :  were not even thinking about john its totally focused on mary

2478 :  its a legitimate thing to ask

2479 :  i dont see these as womens issues that some good men help out with

2480 :  we dont like it when people challenge our power

2481 :  we are both victims of mens violence

2482 :  why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today

2483 :  asking questions about mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence

2484 :  we also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didnt make the choice to be a

2485 :  and if we want to talk about male victims lets talk about male victims

2486 :  the questions are not about mary theyre about john

2487 :  thats a very naive notion right

2488 :  and often times men like myself get a lot of credit and public acclaim for doing the work that women

2489 :  now when it comes to men and male culture the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are

2490 :  how can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes

2491 :  most male victims of violence are the victims of other mens violence

2492 :  how do we challenge our friends

2493 :  what are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men

2494 :  someone is making the rules

2495 :  by last count there were fortyeight different online markets that i know of

2496 :  the goal was to develop a price guide a real data driven view of the market

2497 :  now ive laughed every time ive read this

2498 :  now i loved those american and british books i read

2499 :  and she replied well i have never been taught to ask for consent

2500 :  all of these form of power are at play

2501 :  they dont want to have anything to do with politics

2502 :  and i believe the way we make civics sexy again is to make explicitly about the teaching of

2503 :  end of story

2504 :  everyone has their own unique talents and ideas that they want to share but it starts when we listen to

2505 :  you could support yourself and your family and you would be happy

2506 :  and they are so cool that they have even developed a hand sign

2507 :  singapore for example used to ban chinese language education

2508 :  and now many of you have been reading in the news how people are looking to china to lead the rebound the

2509 :  they are becoming part of its sphere of influence

2510 :  who will win

2511 :  the question is how do we change those borders and what lines do we focus on

2512 :  they think more in terms of empires and hierarchies usually chinese or japanese

2513 :  today countries are bought

2514 :  but what are they guarding

2515 :  just take the balkans

2516 :  of course we cant forget africa

2517 :  now lets look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders and how that has enhanced its strength

2518 :  its just leasing it

2519 :  now it encourages it

2520 :  so whats next

2521 :  its buying it

2522 :  you are with me on that right

2523 :  this is america

2524 :  not what kids should do

2525 :  when we wait until after school for that then we are missing the point that we adults adopted in the first

2526 :  im not advocating doing away with the standards

2527 :  some of us are doing very well

2528 :  is really to align ourselves with this force much greater than ourselves

2529 :  it was a very short life

2530 :  i think that really leads nowhere

2531 :  same thing with the hunter gatherer tribes and early man you didnt live beyond the age of thirty
2532 :  what is the significance

2533 :  you try it out

2534 :  but a better way is what i call the proactionary principle which is you engage with technology

2535 :  and if you go there you say hey everybodys really healthy

2536 :  so another way to think about technology what it means is to imagine a world without technology

2537 :  for happiness to come and find me

2538 :  but it was not without misadventure

2539 :  fortunately help was at hand

2540 :  we had a bit of a battle of wills

2541 :  im totally self supporting out there

2542 :  but what about if we just change that story

2543 :  i had a meeting with the president there who told me about his exit strategy for his country

2544 :  i blogged about it

2545 :  do i have a chase boat

2546 :  the air picks up moisture from the surface of water carries it into the spores makes them move and theyre

2547 :  spores will show the way for that too

2548 :  at that point i thought maybe i could make use of legos the toys that i used to play so much when i

2549 :  it was really interesting

2550 :  and they have very interesting shapes

2551 :  i made use of an idea

2552 :  both are very important for our society

2553 :  they are stiffer than most plastics and thats strange

2554 :  you actually had bacterial spores in there

2555 :  i spent a couple of hours just listening to brett as he told one horrific story after another

2556 :  i once brought a goldfish out with me

2557 :  i sat it on the bar and i ordered a scotch and that goldfish was the best wingman

2558 :  the friend a day project caused me to do things ive never would have done otherwise

2559 :  but now imagine youre on an island with four hundred people

2560 :  props are also really good at providing an entry point for conversation

2561 :  but about a month into this new life i realized something was missing

2562 :  this was the first time that i realized the ripple effect of the project

2563 :  people could not help themselves they had to come up and talk to me

2564 :  the study found strong support for growing body of research that has linked social ties with longevity

2565 :  and as time goes on relationships or connections become more important

2566 :  i had to keep going

2567 :  and with each story i could tell that he was getting lighter and i was getting heavier with this emotional

2568 :  you now have four hundred data points

2569 :  i landed a dream job i found a great apartment

2570 :  i havent said a thing to you that made you think

2571 :  thats very unusual

2572 :  i was told that mens rights activists were against womens equality

2573 :  its all a scam

2574 :  theyre all lying about being abused

2575 :  but i understand their mindset

2576 :  and thats what happened to me

2577 :  i dont think so

2578 :  so im asking questions and im getting their full life story

2579 :  it shapes the way we teach

2580 :  we were so empowered

2581 :  that food you eat comes from somewhere

2582 :  one in three native women are raped in her lifetime

2583 :  please do something

2584 :  the tap water you drink comes from somewhere

2585 :  how can you help

2586 :  are you meeting those requirements

2587 :  only half of the us states mention more than a single tribe and just four states mention the

2588 :  that would change our lives if treaties were actually upheld

2589 :  five billion dollar galileo mission to jupiter two high profile scientific

2590 :  and one study actually put figures on that so it looked at children growing up in persistent poverty and how well they were

2591 :  in one study scientists looked at about seventeen thousand children who were born in one thousand nine hundred and seventy
2592 :  ive got three boys theyre three nine and twelve
2593 :  now as you can imagine the answers arent quite as simple as that

2594 :  let me give you an example of that

2595 :  many children in this study were born into poor families or into working class families that had cramped

2596 :  i am theresa hodge

2597 :  well i knew it wasnt my name

2598 :  and take care of their families

2599 :  its a combination of everybody with one exception

2600 :  we have more black and brown men who are incarcerated

2601 :  my mother my four sisters and my daughter and i

2602 :  maybe this is because the tango embrace is an expression of the argentine culture history and

2603 :  they were lonely and overwhelmed by work

2604 :  it is not impossible

2605 :  if we all started saying to companies show me the transparent supply chain tell me about the lives at

2606 :  there are two ways if were going to reduce things a little bit

2607 :  the sails may gather energy from the solar wind

2608 :  atmospheric particles got enough energy to break free from the gravity of the planet escaping away to space never

2609 :  this cant happen on mars today

2610 :  the magnetic field may gather energy from the solar wind that allows even more atmospheric escape to happen

2611 :  the atmosphere of mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid

2612 :  itll never replace great teachers

2613 :  because that drip doesnt have to be a ticking clock

2614 :  they both got the right answer

2615 :  so let me share with you an example that might help

2616 :  because you know what

2617 :  i wont forget that scene because there wasnt much learning going on but i also wont forget his eyes

2618 :  what is a teacher to do even a great teacher like wendy

2619 :  so really tedx is your program

2620 :  not a lot of people were watching the talks

2621 :  so at the time chris and i sat down to try to figure out what we could do to really take the ted brand and open source it in a

2622 :  at that time it was before the proliferation of video

2623 :  suddenly after years of claiming it was vital to their case the government dropped their demands to risen

2624 :  so we risk seeing the press unable to do their job that the first amendment is supposed to protect because of the governments

2625 :  and along the way he became the face for the us governments recent pattern of prosecuting whistleblowers and

2626 :  i didnt know where i was going but going back was not an option

2627 :  i loved my new found freedom

2628 :  i gathered the girls and we ran out

2629 :  then later when electrical demand increases you can flow that water over that dam through the generators and produce

2630 :  while in undergrad at kent state i found my passion for both chemistry and the energy industry and it was through these two

2631 :  so im sure that you have arrived by now at the same solution i did a time ago and that is is that we need an electrical

2632 :  so ive written several books

2633 :  i am also an author

2634 :  they spend weeks and months in our department

2635 :  they are so small

2636 :  its too painful

2637 :  and what are our basics

2638 :  we bring a one pound baby to grow into a one hundred pound person

2639 :  and i think its the only time in our life we are very happy gaining weight

2640 :  and when pre terms are being touched it improves their weight gain

2641 :  they felt that we are available

2642 :  so we text them an sms update

2643 :  its really amazing

2644 :  and its always the same

2645 :  and it was very emotional for both of us

2646 :  and only fortyeight hours later we got the permission to go home

2647 :  we need to go back to the contact connection and compassion

2648 :  ask yourself every day

2649 :  my first are twin boys

2650 :  she was scared of drunks hanging around

2651 :  it was no big deal but it was a latrine

2652 :  and she was horrified to get there and find that they didnt have a toilet

2653 :  theyve made it conversational

2654 :  shed grown up with a latrine

2655 :  diff and its resistant to antibiotics in many cases

2656 :  we ingest nutrients

2657 :  will people like natural air conditioning

2658 :  earth wind and fire

2659 :  could we learn from them and build a building in reality

2660 :  and it turns out that we have a reliable computer model for that

2661 :  its amazing that you can make a cfd simulation of hundreds of thousands of water

2662 :  and also for the people in the building you can call it a social innovation because the indoor

2663 :  well most probably yes

2664 :  architects dislike airconditioning in fact

2665 :  that can be done

2666 :  it is this fear thats feeding the diet industry which is keeping so many of us from making

2667 :  people who honor our strength and work with not against our perceived limitations

2668 :  not the lowercase muttered behind my back kind or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly

2669 :  i also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk down the street with a spring in

2670 :  billion dollar industries thrive because of the fear of it and those of us who

2671 :  and so as a result people are left comfortably unknowledgeable unaware and unable

2672 :  so lets go with it

2673 :  different how exactly

2674 :  or just maybe exposure or othering come through statements that somehow suggest you

2675 :  no thats totally not how that works

2676 :  and so it is important to know that the huffs and puffs rolling of eyes shifting bodies

2677 :  that said let me reiterate a few things

2678 :  there are no timeouts scheduled intermissions or cushiony convenient moments for

2679 :  yes that unavoidable place where some have and may still voice

2680 :  and so it is then the decidedly cool kids that define the others

2681 :  after all the stellar reputation of the cool kids depends on it

2682 :  and then if i could be so blessed assuming that after having arrived in some

2683 :  how do you distribute

2684 :  i have a global vision for vision

2685 :  well why would i bother doing that

2686 :  one second it becomes more ticklish

2687 :  but weve got a problem

2688 :  we need to continue to move beyond binary thinking for ourselves and for working together

2689 :  with this way of thinking theres no spectrum no gray area and most importantly theres no common ground

2690 :  think about the last us election and how people would align themselves with the most opposite extremes

2691 :  while this binary way of thinking may be useful and unavoidable in some circumstances in others especially when

2692 :  for instance people see and label themselves as either shy or outgoing smart or dumb a

2693 :  what he found was that the legislators that were most effective were the ones most willing to find common ground

2694 :  people think about issues and answers in binaries as well

2695 :  so what are the steps that we can take to accomplish this

2696 :  rarely is someone ever labeled as being just okay at math or a mediocre athlete

2697 :  i think this is a hard question

2698 :  over three these days

2699 :  its education at its best

2700 :  every part of a person body mind and spirit is nourished

2701 :  what they were doing caught peoples attention

2702 :  sometimes they cause conflicts

2703 :  its celebrates work

2704 :  im very grateful because i had been taking groups of students back there ever since and i get to go next week

2705 :  sometimes they kill people

2706 :  i think this is where the intervention needs to begin

2707 :  and that they must have consequences

2708 :  in order to see these phenomena come out in an interview type setting dr

2709 :  if there are three things i hope you take away from this it is one

2710 :  the reason it is important to change them is because we are limiting our pool of innovation by nearly fifty and we have

2711 :  it is literally a physically compacting position

2712 :  but the man was considered weak incompetent

2713 :  we know that this is not ok for mental health and for many other reasons

2714 :  they hesitate more

2715 :  i certainly sit like this usually with my thighs over my hands

2716 :  is it something specific about their merit

2717 :  if you are told what matters is your appearance and you are often not recognised for trying for taking a

2718 :  there are so many ways that each of you today can begin solving this problem

2719 :  as men and women there are expectations for how we will act in society in order for it to run

2720 :  why you did not like that applicant or why you loved that applicant

2721 :  next time you see a parent or a teacher or anyone interacting with a young student think about what they

2722 :  think about it next time you are on a hiring committee

2723 :  this time the results were reversed people liked the woman more

2724 :  they say less

2725 :  so we group together into religions political ideologies communities movements nations and so on

2726 :  theyre so basic to our thinking that they become invisible to us they present themselves as the obvious truths

2727 :  we use them to think perceive and act in a largely habitual and unconscious way but we rarely reflect upon them

2728 :  it was introduced by the personality psychologist silvan tomkins

2729 :  and we have beliefs about religious spiritual and supernatural realities

2730 :  we even shift them away from persons who we dislike

2731 :  they see the world more in terms of good versus evil us versus them

2732 :  we cheer for our favorite team we applaud when it scores we support our teammates and we make

2733 :  so you may for example see another person in terms of the constructs a man or woman

2734 :  if you voted for right wing party you are more likely to endorse the normativistic perspective or a combination of both

2735 :  we have beliefs about what source of knowledge can be trusted

2736 :  so think about when youre watching a political debate or reading a political article

2737 :  i just feel locked in fear

2738 :  they didnt like this at all

2739 :  so it is connected

2740 :  unfortunately few americans have seen one because its been thirtyeight years since one last touched the

2741 :  i dont believe in god

2742 :  i mean the day remained bright

2743 :  well the day of the eclipse found us and many other people out behind the hyatt regency on the beach

2744 :  you might chase something else

2745 :  im a science writer

2746 :  i just eat literally like a vat of brown rice and potatoes and like more bread on

2747 :  people with cf cant actually be in the same room together

2748 :  i was desperately looking for something to grab onto

2749 :  maybe i cant contribute something into the world because i genuinely like am not

2750 :  something that would genuinely help them through their experience

2751 :  so parents of children with cystic fibrosis end up having to take off long periods of work to be able to

2752 :  so how every single atom that makes up you and me was formed in the belly of a sun

2753 :  life isnt about just trying to be happy

2754 :  they have to do science

2755 :  and in fact we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science which is rossiantonite a phosphate

2756 :  so how can it be possible

2757 :  you have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there

2758 :  they have a lot of tasks

2759 :  but soon the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner of the planet searching for new potential

2760 :  thats what i did

2761 :  i said im going to open a theater

2762 :  i dont know if youve ever had a time in your life where you did something and all of a sudden you

2763 :  this is what this group is

2764 :  none of you came im over it

2765 :  and i specifically loved one experience in general which was my class improvisation

2766 :  in government we also have to have a sense of urgency and we as customers have the right to

2767 :  i dont think its going anywhere so im not going to waste my time telling you to spend less time on

2768 :  we have to recognize these everyday instances as well

2769 :  doesnt that sound like every drug you have ever heard of

2770 :  its just one photo its funny

2771 :  we are taught to respect others and treat them how they deserve

2772 :  why am i just sitting here in my pjs watching netflix

2773 :  i was seeing these gorgeous sights jasper had to offer and my first reaction was to take out my phone and post it on

2774 :  but i dont

2775 :  hearing what ive said today might make you think i want you to get off of it

2776 :  how many times do i actually check likes

2777 :  did that facebook scroll make me feel better or worse off

2778 :  anything we do this often is worthy of critical observation

2779 :  its just the most recent tool we use to do what we have always done

2780 :  i was distracted in conversation

2781 :  that dark side that looks at a picture of a happy family and wonders why yours does not look like that

2782 :  and they can pay me for what they find out

2783 :  and when it doesnt its often the fault of those large institutions

2784 :  or at least its up to them to fix the problem

2785 :  and every month a small amount of money is deducted from my paycheck and invested in mutual funds in my

2786 :  but things like this happen in the western world as well and the yap actually still use a form of these

2787 :  now the yap dont actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with

2788 :  our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact is being held

2789 :  but it also greatly increased productivity

2790 :  imagine an internet without ads because instead of paying with our attention when we view

2791 :  it still counted

2792 :  will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions

2793 :  a polar bear to evolve a coat will take thousands of generations maybe one hundred thousand years

2794 :  its almost as though its performing a virtual reality simulation of the other persons action

2795 :  for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation

2796 :  this is what i spoke about in the last ted

2797 :  well not quite

2798 :  if anybody in tohoku wants to start manufacturing this we would actually help them

2799 :  that this precious resource called water is something we all have to share

2800 :  i know it has for me

2801 :  that said visual perception is not very well understood not only in animals but even in

2802 :  today i am going to tell a story that begins with the octopus and talks about several aspects

2803 :  therefore visual perception is a major part of the natural world

2804 :  and in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground the water encounters

2805 :  weve been doing this for a couple of decades now

2806 :  but my own experiences working with some of the worlds most water starved cities in the last decades

2807 :  for those of us who are fortunate enough to live in one of the worlds great cities weve never truly

2808 :  weve made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades

2809 :  and the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in california and other

2810 :  and thats because when things have gotten bad in the past its always been possible to expand a reservoir

2811 :  our grandparents generation created an amazing system of canals and reservoirs that made it

2812 :  im the number one

2813 :  so i just want to come back to normal

2814 :  and i tried to learn i tried to study

2815 :  the same is possible in social media today

2816 :  lets go and have a demonstration on saturday

2817 :  they sometimes even do experiments and lectures in coffee houses

2818 :  he prints a thousand copies

2819 :  they all become specialized for the task at hand

2820 :  all it takes for example in the sound domain is exposure to sound

2821 :  and by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement

2822 :  so what was sixtuss dream what was the big plan here

2823 :  but if conditions change and become unfavorable hydra will actually turn to sexual reproduction by actually

2824 :  two billion years

2825 :  how many of you have thought about sex today

2826 :  and it was a creature vastly different to ourselves

2827 :  and it still happens today

2828 :  if we look at the entire four
2829 :  what if youre the trailblazer

2830 :  what what what

2831 :  which he considered disgusting

2832 :  because we all are human we all struggle

2833 :  what if youre the pioneer

2834 :  and i was fed up of always being on the edge always being the one doing those weird

2835 :  we with the broken bits

2836 :  or perhaps its alcoholism or family dysfunction or poverty or homophobia is something

2837 :  and i felt like the only way to achieve normality was to not be ill any more to not

2838 :  its not a badge of honor

2839 :  if i had been spending my energy trying to fit in i would never have been able to be an advocate for women

2840 :  so if you want to call us motherhood were proud to be associated with it

2841 :  go on look at each other

2842 :  ok have i made the point

2843 :  weve got to change our lifestyles we know that

2844 :  and possibly the cosmos we dont know

2845 :  so they were the prime things we were doing

2846 :  we didnt we were lucky

2847 :  and thats what its all about

2848 :  let me ask you a question

2849 :  a whole lot of very wise people working for the future

2850 :  and we were waiting and waiting

2851 :  i was about five years old

2852 :  so i dont believe in competition

2853 :  and my mother and i were in the kitchen in our house in london

2854 :  i worked very hard i got straight as and i went to oxford

2855 :  and she had some practical advice as well but suddenly the moral of her story was that the more you give the more

2856 :  i was raised in a single parent family we didnt have much money and therefore i found it

2857 :  the worst and probably most difficult day in my life was september 3rd one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight
2858 :  but now i realize that theres so much more to the story

2859 :  so after doing that for a few years eventually by pure chance i happened to meet an executive at

2860 :  and they were supposed to come home on september 3rd one thousand nine hundred and eightyeight
2861 :  wed just gotten back from a wedding in nigeria

2862 :  and then no television expanded into no phones no cable no music

2863 :  you just have to be ready

2864 :  there are plenty of people who work hard who dont necessarily make it in their chosen careers

2865 :  and during that time the recession kicked in and i lost my job

2866 :  and then later on that day my mother got a phone call from a family friend in nigeria and the

2867 :  and the reason why i share that is because i want to let you know that success is never really in a straight line

2868 :  i thought you know what

2869 :  i believe in creating what i want

2870 :  so it took them several months to get back to me

2871 :  what do you want to do

2872 :  so when i met him he gave me about two weeks to come in for a screen test and

2873 :  thats all i really knew how to do

2874 :  so eventually after emailing and pestering constantly they eventually got back to me

2875 :  everyone in the car died instantly apart from one person in the back seat where my father and my brother were sitting

2876 :  so this is a lesson as well that i had learned from my older brother

2877 :  usually what they say is if you want to be successful you need to network have a brand study your competition

2878 :  and so that could be anything from being a sports reporter to being a political reporter or a business reporter

2879 :  did it work

2880 :  and ive done this with other cultures and other languages and i even managed to learn a little american sign language

2881 :  but rather than be impressive i think its so much better when you embrace the beginning stage of language learning

2882 :  so lets say theres some inborn trait to give somebody twenty advantage over the rest of the people

2883 :  a lot of us start with the wrong motivation to learn a language

2884 :  but i always did we all always do

2885 :  and i do have the ability i do have the skill to learn a language

2886 :  theres no language gene we all have it already

2887 :  im not very sensible though

2888 :  but even a present day transistor operates at the gigahertz

2889 :  couldnt find a bug

2890 :  a couple of years ago we did a survey of some of the worlds leading a

2891 :  he came down and he showed me

2892 :  now little johnny is being like oh mum please please please

2893 :  so the mind has so much power over what we do in life

2894 :  weve got to be able to let them explore their environment

2895 :  for us to know what the human body is capable of to know what the mind is capable of

2896 :  but what if we could start looking at obstacles in a different way what if we could start seeing them than instead of things that are stopping us

2897 :  what happens then

2898 :  you get up to that first obstacle put your hands on the steel rails like amp quot all right

2899 :  we went up together we started climbing

2900 :  so i was like oh mum just going to the library today

2901 :  he climbed the whole obstacle came back down

2902 :  you have to stop

2903 :  for me it was like the love for it ill wait anything else in life

2904 :  i said i am going to look at this obstacle as an opportunity

2905 :  i loved it too much

2906 :  but if we think we are going to make it then we make it

2907 :  i was like all right

2908 :  were wasting all of these resources concretes metal hardwoods hiding them in vast

2909 :  so lets return to the idea of protection sanitation and beautification

2910 :  in a traditional cremation the ashes that are left over inorganic bone fragments form a

2911 :  well start with a dead body

2912 :  on this particular day there were twelve bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition

2913 :  will changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change

2914 :  i was there because a colleague of mine named katrina spade is attempting to create a system not of

2915 :  its a multi billion dollar industry and its economic model is based on the principle of

2916 :  accepting the fact that we are animals has some potentially terrifying consequences

2917 :  but if youre recomposed if you actually become the soil you can nourish the tree and become the post

2918 :  at the cemetery on the day of burial that casket will be lowered into a large concrete or metal

2919 :  the funeral industry will protect your dead body by offering to sell your family a casket

2920 :  i was at western carolina university at their body farm more accurately called a

2921 :  theyll put it in a suit

2922 :  for the last nine years ive worked in the funeral industry first as a crematory operator

2923 :  they offer public trails places for spiritual practice places for

2924 :  this procedure drains your blood and replaces it with a toxic cancer causing

2925 :  in fact its likely happening right now as we speak

2926 :  in america our death traditions have come to be chemical embalming followed

2927 :  for many of us being sanitized and beautified just doesnt reflect us

2928 :  the dead then blend seamlessly in with the landscape

2929 :  no really i cant

2930 :  the graves are scattered about the property under elegant mounds marked only by a rock or a

2931 :  i think for a lot of people theyre starting to get the sense that our current funeral industry

2932 :  theyll put it in makeup

2933 :  it doesnt reflect what we stood for during our lives

2934 :  but it will make bold moves in how we see ourselves as citizens of this planet

2935 :  ca benoit mandelbrot is in the audience

2936 :  it doesnt matter how many words you can say how many phrases you know

2937 :  now i didnt sit down one day and write a list of my besties and moms just happened to be at the top

2938 :  and why did my story circle around hers

2939 :  okay besides norman bates

2940 :  and the biggest challenge for me was articulating this concept of rehabilitation simply because it was

2941 :  we talked about writing new policies relaxing the rules of existing policy or creating new

2942 :  why were my lifes greatest lessons predicated on her pain

2943 :  after she was gone i even questioned the value of her life so while her death wrung out my heart

2944 :  but what if weve been thinking about the nature of choice making all wrong

2945 :  and truly in that moment that woman and every woman like her became my mother

2946 :  dont assume that someone elses story doesnt have value simply because it doesnt measure up to

2947 :  every time ive been that model for someone else lives have changed

2948 :  that happened the day someone called me a manipulator

2949 :  so what takes the place of that healthy support system now out of reach

2950 :  cracked sidewalks be damned

2951 :  i just missed her

2952 :  setting aside the particular circumstances that aid in overcoming adversity most people come

2953 :  rehabilitation as an operative definition that is people centered rather than system centered

2954 :  stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well

2955 :  dont be scared of them

2956 :  lets find these complex problems

2957 :  and you know what

2958 :  many selfies maybe its because of expertise or not have a blur within the image itself

2959 :  do i have muffin top

2960 :  do these jeans make me look fat

2961 :  we need shelter and love

2962 :  one time i asked her what her favorite color was

2963 :  we need clean water to drink

2964 :  and meanwhile our trans children suffer

2965 :  and this is a great and necessary thing but most of that attention has been focused on a very few

2966 :  he didnt wait around for the press release

2967 :  there are so many questions that we still dont know

2968 :  and i said what

2969 :  what makes markets work

2970 :  and at the same time i was looking on the internet people were really experimenting with youtube videos and taking recordings and making

2971 :  so i went and i interviewed him and i recorded this conversation that i had with him

2972 :  what is gravity

2973 :  he didnt wait around for the reporter to come calling

2974 :  so whats the other ninetyfive
2975 :  by utilizing streaming video technology and social media interactivity i was able to create a space

2976 :  more people than had ever seen me play in all the years of my life combined

2977 :  how could i make them feel like they are in the same room as me not just listening but actively contributing

2978 :  back in two thousand and six i decided to have some fun one day and as an experiment i recorded myself playing a

2979 :  heck we even invented this new material first before we made this mess so

2980 :  theyve got better things to do in the wild

2981 :  that was my point with that

2982 :  it doesnt have to be that way

2983 :  i know whats inside me i know when somethings wrong

2984 :  i found out that i am one of fortyfive million women who have whats called

2985 :  you know what

2986 :  i mean hes got to know more

2987 :  its ok you just need to know how to take care of them

2988 :  its in between your breasts

2989 :  maybe if my cancer had been found a year before when it was smaller and easy to

2990 :  you know what

2991 :  paula gordons study

2992 :  im just going to see a breast surgeon

2993 :  and you know what they said

2994 :  get off of automatic pilot

2995 :  it hates status quo and it hates automatic pilot

2996 :  and its where you take information in from all the sources blend it with the rich knowledge thats

2997 :  im going to give you strategies and i call them brain powers

2998 :  the brain power of one

2999 :  but it doesnt have to happen

3000 :  so i decided to conduct my own little experiment

3001 :  so the memorial opened in two thousand and eleven and the museums going to open next year in two thousand and fourteen
3002 :  its essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive one conversation at a time

3003 :  we want people who live here people who have ownership

3004 :  im going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project

3005 :  and walds widow requested that they be listed next to each other

3006 :  and the question is who do you want to remember if you had just fortyfive minutes with your grandmother

3007 :  it is something that is built into the school ground

3008 :  its part of the playground

3009 :  were now over twentytwo in colorado

3010 :  it could be lets say for example a u

3011 :  its a key distinction

3012 :  you can drive this around like a sports car

3013 :  could you apply these tunnels to use for this hyperloop idea you released a few years ago

3014 :  aspirationally thats our target

3015 :  like why do you want to live

3016 :  is there a tie in here with hyperloop

3017 :  so thats roughly a half order of magnitude improvement right there

3018 :  so this will be a very spry truck

3019 :  some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric and some are just dabbling in it

3020 :  how many gigafactories if you like does it take to get us there

3021 :  em well when its running at full speed you cant actually see the cells without a strobe light

3022 :  sustainable energy will happen no matter what

3023 :  thats a real fake house

3024 :  it takes away so much of your life

3025 :  but why not just do that

3026 :  what do you love about the future

3027 :  solar energy we need to get there so we need to make these beautiful roofs

3028 :  we think probably more but yeah

3029 :  and we almost never saw a reef hit zero

3030 :  if you think it is the same boat why

3031 :  and once we figure out why they would do

3032 :  we have to get the arrow going in the right direction and we can build these really interesting deep conversations with kids

3033 :  but a lot of philosophers believe thats the only way we can be free

3034 :  your friend just made this claim can you imagine a counterexample or a different alternative

3035 :  why do you not do those things when you dont have the ring

3036 :  and the result is that kids think these are questions that dont matter

3037 :  they ask these kinds of questions on their own

3038 :  and then starting with the boat we can translate that into a discussion about personal identity human identity

3039 :  how would we know if it does

3040 :  were creatures who change over time

3041 :  when ive gone into classes and ive worked with third grade up through twelfth grade in high school

3042 :  come up with a counterexample

3043 :  they are not wrong because they are punished

3044 :  and why do we start wars

3045 :  we dont need beakers or chemicals theres no safety training

3046 :  say what it is and show how it meets that persons claim

3047 :  and initially some kids will think its wrong because we get punished for it

3048 :  what is the nature of that thing

3049 :  these are the kinds of philosophical questions

3050 :  is it standing up in the face of your own fear and doing something

3051 :  over the course of time maybe five years you actually replace every single board or every single part of the boat

3052 :  and so we fumble right and maybe we put it off a little bit and we dont actually address them

3053 :  what stops you

3054 :  they are wondering about where they are and how the world works and what their place is in it

3055 :  the answers are ambiguous

3056 :  imagine you have a boat

3057 :  and its our job to help give them uptake on those questions

3058 :  at what point in this process of change would you have said ah no you have a new boat

3059 :  what is bravery

3060 :  and the beautiful thing about them is they dont take any lab space

3061 :  were increasingly getting funneled in that direction in education

3062 :  but even at home i think often they dont get uptake

3063 :  well talk about bravery

3064 :  but they do matter

3065 :  so these are the kinds of questions that philosophers ask and like i said i think kids ask them very naturally

3066 :  and its amazing what they come up with

3067 :  so well use even simple things like arnold lobels frog and toad adventures

3068 :  we need to engage kids on the questions that they have

3069 :  we want to enhance their cognitive skills

3070 :  so they dont really get uptake in the educational system in part because teachers arent trained to deal with those kinds of

3071 :  imagine that you find a ring and if you twist that ring it makes you invisible

3072 :  philosophy is understood to be a deep abstract rigorous difficult kind of discipline

3073 :  look at us run away from the snake but were being very brave

3074 :  but then we can help them through the process of discussion to come to see that we punish those things because they are

3075 :  and what it would mean for us to say that were free

3076 :  i think this is really empowering for them

3077 :  one of the greatest things is youll get best friends saying i never realized i could really disagree with him about something

3078 :  those are good skills that are going to do well for them in other kinds of endeavors as well

3079 :  critical thinking right

3080 :  theyre trying to understand their world

3081 :  what remains the same through that process of change over time

3082 :  are we really the same as our earlier selves

3083 :  kids are actually very natural philosophers

3084 :  thats why we need to do philosophy

3085 :  if we are both determined and free

3086 :  and i think thats what education is all about

3087 :  adults have a much harder time asking them

3088 :  philosophers want to know for instance if we are really free

3089 :  and what allows us to make that kind of claim

3090 :  so we develop these really interesting discussions out of literature out of puzzles out of thought experiments and we have

3091 :  even can you know right now that youre not dreaming

3092 :  either remains the same or how do you retain an identity over all of this change

3093 :  most people think thats absolutely insane impossible

3094 :  and if you think its not the same boat well now tell me when did it not become the same boat

3095 :  you cant teach that for the test very easily

3096 :  so we have an interesting discussion with the kids

3097 :  and what weve found not only in our own work where kids really enjoy it and love it but in work done around the

3098 :  so what are philosophers known for

3099 :  and make meaning in it

3100 :  or well ask questions about the nature of right and wrong

3101 :  how do we make meaning in our lives knowing that were all going to die

3102 :  thats completely untrue

3103 :  but these days open homophobia is being replaced by more of a subtle heterosexism where people in the

3104 :  this is a trait that ought to go extinct in a few generations but down through recorded history in every

3105 :  thankfully the sexual minority these days have many options for having kids of their own and i have a

3106 :  i mean gays have eighty fewer kids than heterosexuals

3107 :  the cry of raw data now

3108 :  here is one of his messages

3109 :  as a lover of human anatomy im so excited that were finally putting our bodies at the center of focus

3110 :  why desktop computers

3111 :  it is a computer

3112 :  i believe that trauma is the number one public health crisis in our country

3113 :  if someone wanted to dispose of a plastic water bottle for instance and there was a trash can

3114 :  through being open to change within ourselves as well as change outside of ourselves we can

3115 :  we did this because we decided to create these recycling

3116 :  and that was my first time to be acquainted with that

3117 :  we learn how our brains and bodies work by watching those around us

3118 :  if you dont adhd yourself chances are you know somebody who does

3119 :  im happier and more successful than ive ever been in my life

3120 :  i started having trouble making it to class on time

3121 :  theyre your employee your boss your friend theyre in this room

3122 :  i thought it was mostly about getting distracted

3123 :  it wasnt until middle school when i was responsible for getting myself to classes on time and remembering to bring my own

3124 :  and what bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that

3125 :  because after all if you ask even grownups about statistics they look extremely stupid

3126 :  they go out and test it against the evidence

3127 :  and that one big disadvantage is that until you actually do all that learning youre going to be helpless

3128 :  so what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex the sort of executive part of our brains sends a signal

3129 :  and in studies weve just been doing in my lab similar studies weve show that four year olds are actually better at

3130 :  we dont have to do anything

3131 :  whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months

3132 :  one of the first lines of poetry i can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded i hate myself

3133 :  when i was eleven i wanted to be left alone

3134 :  when i was twelve i wanted to die

3135 :  one day before i realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees i fell out of a tree and bruised the right

3136 :  we grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them

3137 :  when i was nine i saw the movie jaws and thought to myself no thank you

3138 :  we used to stay inside for recess because outside was worse

3139 :  i had it all figured out

3140 :  i was going to be a wrestler

3141 :  not really a big deal

3142 :  when i was eight i wanted to be a marine biologist

3143 :  turns out its not that hard to trick someone and one day before class i said yeah you can copy my homework

3144 :  we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day

3145 :  i thought they were both pork chops

3146 :  so what happens

3147 :  because a marathon doesnt goof around

3148 :  information such as

3149 :  how do you develop the skills to develop the resilience to keep going when life circumstances and

3150 :  move and the car goes past you

3151 :  theyre just not big enough

3152 :  thank you very much

3153 :  theyre not going to do something like the dinosaur killer did

3154 :  the earths gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much

3155 :  the second step is if we see one heading toward us we have to stop it

3156 :  but whats the second step

3157 :  rusty schweickart who was an apollo nine astronaut is on this

3158 :  there is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact if any of you have ever been to

3159 :  that means we can do it again

3160 :  youve probably heard about the asteroid apophis

3161 :  its four oclock in the morning

3162 :  so we had to hug everybody before we went outside to play

3163 :  the sapara freely provide their treatments to anyone the

3164 :  wed pull up in front of my aunt and uncles house with its white wooded siding

3165 :  and sleepily wed get back in the car and go back to the city

3166 :  and why i image the winds is because they remind me of our connection to everything as

3167 :  for miles they travel to cut the trees down to build their homes

3168 :  and i realized how blessed i was to have him in my life

3169 :  we are part of spirit grandmother and grandfather

3170 :  what are we waiting for

3171 :  what made a difference for the abecedarian children

3172 :  so heres an alarming thought

3173 :  weve got these new antibodies weve identified and we know that they latch onto many many variations of the

3174 :  we know that they have to latch onto a specific part so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part

3175 :  so the real question then is how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect

3176 :  so to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of

3177 :  so for instance a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza

3178 :  so youve got this situation in two thousand and three we had an h5n1

3179 :  why is that

3180 :  well with the new technologies emerging now i hope we can say definitively yes

3181 :  it has to be the exceptions

3182 :  even though we are really really early in the process of that project its so fascinating and i have

3183 :  we had to find free and found materials every night so we could work the next

3184 :  theres no capital for the non profit

3185 :  were with you

3186 :  would the racial problems in the united states be what they are

3187 :  after watching this video an hour later rich people became just as generous of

3188 :  and thats a really really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of

3189 :  now in california as you all know because im sure we all do this its the law to

3190 :  youll to have to pardon the sound quality because again these were hidden cameras

3191 :  those customers would be those worst affected by the global financial crisis

3192 :  we need a robust profitable and healthy banking sector in our society

3193 :  banks just went to being banks again

3194 :  we dont want a system that is too big to fail we want a system that is too good to fail

3195 :  it is not just about enriching a chosen few

3196 :  so i simply ask

3197 :  higher unemployment higher taxes and lower real wages

3198 :  the good bank would not have clients it would only have customers

3199 :  peel back the onion

3200 :  human ingenuity is an unstoppable force in a free society

3201 :  that price would be paid for many decades to come

3202 :  the good bank would do something about that insidious disease that terminal illness inflicted on young people called a lifetime of

3203 :  in my rehabilitation i made a vow

3204 :  because the good bank believes in having smart customers

3205 :  i choose not to ignore the envelopes anymore

3206 :  could it be bad news from the tax office

3207 :  its out of style just after a few months

3208 :  it started to frustrate the other players

3209 :  some of the players get angry very easily

3210 :  sometimes its just a miscommunication between two kids

3211 :  maybe a pet died

3212 :  well last year that number was six
3213 :  what happens then

3214 :  all of their homes were washed away by the tsunami two and a half years ago

3215 :  they formed a bond

3216 :  because its not all in the past

3217 :  and there is a dark side to all of these stories and myths that can be really damaging

3218 :  if that story makes us feel good about ourselves then so much the better

3219 :  its actually really quite inspiring

3220 :  what they really want is a myth

3221 :  we write books about it we write novels about it we make films about it

3222 :  human beings dont like to be told what to do were proud creatures we think we know

3223 :  he imagines what the world would be like without a government where everyone is equal

3224 :  and the third reason that hobbes gives for why the state of nature is a state of war is that there are some of

3225 :  so he saw at first hand just how horrific life is without

3226 :  moral of this story is

3227 :  no comedian wants to offend you thats not our job

3228 :  if we were to come on stage and talk to you about our real opinions with balanced thought through points we

3229 :  he made a joke about the paralympics

3230 :  take it home

3231 :  no of course

3232 :  and somehow integrate myself into this story so id become a hero so i can then go out on stage in front of a

3233 :  there was no monster under the bed no boogie man in the corner

3234 :  youre laughing at me for being an idiot for thinking thats a good idea

3235 :  and sometimes we turn it in a way that you dont like

3236 :  thats not fair

3237 :  this happened this happened then this happened therefore this happened

3238 :  everyone would agree that my dads a dreadful man

3239 :  im a comedian

3240 :  i tell stories differently as well

3241 :  but theres also a market for legging sadomasochism and justin bieber

3242 :  they thought it was great

3243 :  if at any point youve dis agreed with anything ive said dont worry it was just a story i made it all up

3244 :  youre not laughing at the fact that im trying to kill my brothers

3245 :  we might play a version of ourselves

3246 :  whereas most of the time its a hardship thats caused us to get into comedy

3247 :  its always stuff like

3248 :  were desperate storytellers

3249 :  and people went mental

3250 :  you dont take other storytellers stories out of context

3251 :  shes on her third martini shes ready to go

3252 :  then switch over to eastenders or true blood where there are scenes of murder sexual

3253 :  there is a market for shock comedy

3254 :  oh i cant believe christopher waltz killed all those jewish people

3255 :  but we cant be our true selves

3256 :  everythings a different way of telling a story

3257 :  a huge market ok

3258 :  our reaction to our hardships was to make light of the situation and get over it as opposed to going round the country making sure that

3259 :  thats when she knew about it

3260 :  it seems the general public can say whatever they want about celebrities but comedians cant and thats hypocrisy

3261 :  and the main reason it hasnt worked is the internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than

3262 :  we are in a world where most american citizens over the age of twelve
3263 :  so they went for plan b

3264 :  some of the stuff we share is stuff weve found

3265 :  so when the audio home recording act of one thousand nine hundred and ninetytwo was passed the media businesses gave up

3266 :  its from the senate

3267 :  so it sees a smile as a smile

3268 :  this was the breakthrough

3269 :  and the sauce was code in software that wed written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come

3270 :  so this became the foundation of our research as we went forward

3271 :  we did about three hundred and twentyfive shots

3272 :  so we stopped the ship as you do

3273 :  but the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen

3274 :  ive seen the way youve been training

3275 :  and i had to visualize the swim

3276 :  and this dream which i had had ever since i was a young boy with my father was just going out the

3277 :  weve come a long way

3278 :  a number of years ago he tried to ski all the way to the north pole

3279 :  and the water at the north pole is minus one
3280 :  there was something about that place which drew me to it

3281 :  and so i literally swam across the north pole hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind

3282 :  i had to taste the salt water in my mouth

3283 :  and so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded

3284 :  i was hyperventilating so much and within seconds my hands were numb

3285 :  and perhaps the best place to start is with my late father

3286 :  we carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the north pole

3287 :  i could barely breathe

3288 :  we are going to actually have to take them off

3289 :  he also told me about the great explorers

3290 :  and i realize the reason why youre going to do this

3291 :  i had never seen black water before

3292 :  this is such an important swim

3293 :  at the very best im going to end up losing some fingers

3294 :  i so believe in you lewis

3295 :  i was gasping for air

3296 :  but was it worth it

3297 :  ok so whats the problem

3298 :  and we could have a way of cancer self destructing

3299 :  i also promised i was going to talk about cancer

3300 :  the problem is though that proteins dont always fold properly

3301 :  why then do cells ever have problems

3302 :  and its not just alzheimers

3303 :  i know ruben personally from my work and to come up here and offer understanding and awareness

3304 :  who out there should be changing the world

3305 :  and now eventually i can say that one of my achievements will be that i can get married to someone

3306 :  and on one of them i wanted to put about the discussions for same sex marriage and i didnt actually think it

3307 :  when is this recession going to end

3308 :  where is it going next

3309 :  and i figured well so what am i supposed to do about it

3310 :  he used the business card

3311 :  this was a problem student that i wasnt getting through to

3312 :  the most profound hallucinogen

3313 :  he makes the telephone call

3314 :  we would leave

3315 :  i its the ego

3316 :  they werent talking about a queer little black boy in little rock arkansas

3317 :  gospel is about a communal sharing of an experience

3318 :  whether its secularized or a spiritual one

3319 :  so why is this music not speaking to my condition

3320 :  it was much later when i started to study it formally that i understood what was happening in my neighborhood when

3321 :  at the car parties my parents had or when relatives had barbecues if an al green song a marvin gaye song

3322 :  theres a lot of brutality going on but theres still this music

3323 :  and wheres this angst coming from

3324 :  how can i now call my momma a bitch and think of her as anything less than the powerful woman she was who made her

3325 :  theres a call and response to music

3326 :  but i was able to take this music somehow which had been a gift from my father i dont think he knew it was a gift

3327 :  meantime i am this adolescent preteen trying to find my way here

3328 :  i fall in love with my best friend

3329 :  somebody whos always inspired me my entire life is my mother

3330 :  this is where i now call home

3331 :  my mother worked extremely hard through our childhood to provide for her five children but it wasnt ever a walk in the park

3332 :  so youre probably wondering why im asking you these questions

3333 :  so lead by your own example and inspire one another

3334 :  my mother took myself and my four other siblings to the netherlands where we were reunited with my dad who had already

3335 :  ten billion people who even the smartest of minds havent really figured out exactly how we are going to feed those people

3336 :  and they would just laugh at me they just called me stupid

3337 :  i was always the person to say oh vegetarians are way too picky

3338 :  when i was six we finally managed to scrape together enough money for that

3339 :  she had so many things that were so difficult for her but no matter how many countries we had to move no matter how many

3340 :  thats ten billion people who all deserve food water and shelter

3341 :  well ive got this friend called tom hes a chef at a pub in london where

3342 :  we are sending the message hey kid

3343 :  once upon a time a child came upon a butterfly struggling to emerge from its chrysalis

3344 :  and you know what the message we send is when we do that

3345 :  they dont meet each others spouses or children

3346 :  but it is a gross distortion of reality

3347 :  nobody doubts that this is happening in washington

3348 :  some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts

3349 :  its also stability versus chaos

3350 :  it feels really satisfying

3351 :  im talking instead about threats that are headed our way but theyre wrapped in a special energy field that polarizes us

3352 :  so for a lot of reasons those decades after the second world war were an historically anomalous time

3353 :  this is where we are as a country

3354 :  sometimes a single threat can polarize us as we saw

3355 :  to understand why this is happening to us and what we can do about it we need to learn more about moral psychology

3356 :  we can do it

3357 :  theres no more relationship there

3358 :  cant you see reality

3359 :  the left has been very reluctant to say that marriage is actually good for women and for children

3360 :  now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s and the left has been saying its not a

3361 :  its not a problem

3362 :  and trying to run congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil

3363 :  curiosity about people in the tribe curiosity about outsiders

3364 :  but you dont need everyone

3365 :  you get to tell the story on blakes behalf on behalf of the people who got the shoes

3366 :  and i want to share a couple stories with you today

3367 :  they have curiosity

3368 :  they commit to the tribe

3369 :  and then he went to north carolina and did it again

3370 :  that we try to find a piece of the status quo something that bothers us something that needs to be improved something that is

3371 :  one of them is the twin tree program and this is a powerful program

3372 :  the main control system for the newer advanced ones are all neural implants which is an open

3373 :  i was sixteen at the time

3374 :  i didnt have a whole lot of money to put into this

3375 :  so i really looked around and tried to use my resources as much as possible

3376 :  so throughout learning it was a challenge

3377 :  from there i entered this into the science fair in colorado and at the state science fair

3378 :  if you times that by five you get individual finger control of a whole hand

3379 :  i have a new design where all the motors were concealed within the palm of the hand still the same size and i get over twice the

3380 :  thats just what i had of laying around and i want to make use of it

3381 :  i was handing up food to the homeless in detroit

3382 :  this is where the story gets a little strange and to me very interesting because for a long time

3383 :  and thats true you cant change your genes

3384 :  the most fundamental thing about dna is that its stable

3385 :  we are designed to upgrade on our own

3386 :  why is that

3387 :  now admittedly we do not have the perfect examples yet in human beings

3388 :  using mri scans neuroscientists have seen the subtle physical changes in the

3389 :  its called epigenetic inheritance

3390 :  if you look closely at science from the last few decades a very different lesson emerges

3391 :  so what might be happening there

3392 :  and so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive

3393 :  and so what id like to do and i know that this is for some of you of more immediate nature ive got a couple years

3394 :  there is hope

3395 :  people have tried other approaches with helmets

3396 :  so this left right motion was sort of a whiplash type phenomenon

3397 :  his head did not move to the right

3398 :  they have an industry body which is the way most industries work

3399 :  theyre not regulated by the government anyway

3400 :  most experts think that thats the critical factor that might start to tell us what is happening in concussion

3401 :  and so we are collaborating with a company in sweden called h vding

3402 :  so it rigidly couples to your skull and gives you the most precise possible measurement of how the skull moves

3403 :  thats a reality

3404 :  one way we can do that is to try to better understand them

3405 :  weve got to come up with unique ways to try and save elephants

3406 :  elephants are on the verge of extinction on two continents

3407 :  africa and asia

3408 :  it costs billions of dollars a year to educate children

3409 :  now i believe him

3410 :  her hair was tangled black and wild

3411 :  i knew very little of them as people

3412 :  and for some reason he was like sure why not

3413 :  this is all started with a partnership with the iowa cubs where on road trips they would gather their

3414 :  weve since grown that initiative and weve included a hotel management group that has three hotels in the greater

3415 :  there are certain organizations in des moines that are doing an incredible job meeting those needs and for us we feel the best

3416 :  information is up on the screen

3417 :  however we dont believe that introducing more homeless services will lead us to ending

3418 :  and we believe it can be done and im here to invite you in on this

3419 :  of course we cant redesign human legs but we can attach extra tendons on the outside

3420 :  both of these problems can be solved by robotics

3421 :  so im now a professor in mechanical engineering but i actually started my scientific career in a veterinary

3422 :  and of course they should have

3423 :  and we can even improve on nature by using those same principles in new ways that nature

3424 :  so theres no mechanical coupling theres only an electrical coupling

3425 :  well my answer is

3426 :  why didnt they use horses in afghanistan

3427 :  they just got together

3428 :  and we learned through them

3429 :  just enough to get rid of inflation then everything would be good again

3430 :  what kind of country allows a situation to get so hard that cannot get its act together

3431 :  we were a joke

3432 :  there are other species

3433 :  died unfortunately two days later

3434 :  that would be very embarrassing

3435 :  and thats happened before

3436 :  one is the mitochondrial genome and the mitochondria are the organelles in the cell that make energy

3437 :  i would be less mindful of time and of death and oh i would not be disabled would not suffer the thousand

3438 :  but what to get the man who broke your fucking neck

3439 :  abed would say im sorry

3440 :  i was quiet because i had not come for truth

3441 :  and it was then i understood that no matter how stark the reality the human being fits it into a narrative that is

3442 :  a friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories mirrored my own each centering on a life that had

3443 :  but i also saw in my reflection that had abed not injured me i would now in all likelihood be a

3444 :  i then began to wonder as i had many times before how my life would have been different had this man not injured me had my

3445 :  no i was quiet

3446 :  it was this youth who on may sixteen one thousand nine hundred and ninety had broken two necks including mine and bruised

3447 :  my shoes flew off

3448 :  i suppose they were true

3449 :  the perpetrator becomes the victim

3450 :  i didnt see abed coming

3451 :  when one morning years after the crash i stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot felt the flash of

3452 :  but i didnt say these things to abed

3453 :  so the question is can we bridge this gulf

3454 :  we see each other for who we are on the inside

3455 :  this is actually a brainwave sensor thats reading the electrical activity of my brain as i give this talk

3456 :  this is the term that armies use when theyve lost a battle

3457 :  but they just dont make them like they used to which is another sign of the decline in america

3458 :  and they do it because they dont have enough information

3459 :  so what ive done is created a highly scientific taxonomy of haters

3460 :  sometimes i get voice mails saying that if i continue telling my jokes theyll kill

3461 :  its about justice

3462 :  this is the group i like to target with social justice comedy

3463 :  and those death threats are definitely not funny

3464 :  sometimes i get mean tweets and hate mail

3465 :  i find myself wondering what kind of world is he entering

3466 :  this was the one true defining moment of my life

3467 :  and that was a simple choice of deciding yes or deciding no

3468 :  so a few weeks ago we did a big project for the brighton council

3469 :  so this is what we have at the beginning of our workshops the kids will sit down and talk about the issues and the ideas and what they like and

3470 :  we graduated a year ago from university and it was part of joes final year project

3471 :  weve started to include adults in this process as well

3472 :  they just want to say what they think and theyre not really willing to be open minded about the

3473 :  so this is what we do this is what joe and i do

3474 :  theyre loud and theyre noisy but its in a really positive way and it works really well

3475 :  they should be asked what they think and what they want and sometimes developments will put in a slide

3476 :  it shouldnt be this way

3477 :  transported from africa to the new world

3478 :  sometimes its also because of the sonogram

3479 :  its a waste of resources if you dont use someone like dai manju

3480 :  she rocketed to the top of her class

3481 :  the second item on the agenda is maternal mortality

3482 :  but in most of the rest of the world thats not the case

3483 :  she scouted for jobs down in guangdong province in the south

3484 :  and ill just say two things about this

3485 :  do you think well make it

3486 :  heifer sent two goats to africa

3487 :  and that brings me to my first major of two tenets of half the sky

3488 :  around the world one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth

3489 :  aid helping people is not easy and there have been books that have criticized u

3490 :  dai manju was in sixth grade when her parents said were going to pull you out of school because the

3491 :  youre probably asking that

3492 :  theres a book called dead aid

3493 :  turns out that its a failed irrigation project

3494 :  she was beaten every single day by her husband who was unemployed

3495 :  so i am that german person

3496 :  when she lived with us it was actually the first time of her life that she had been abroad and independent of her

3497 :  so this is me today

3498 :  each one of us encompasses the other each one of us encompasses that force that we put behind

3499 :  lets allow for the creation of a common dream

3500 :  world mythologies and religions are full of examples of heroes who chose this way in order to be

3501 :  and vice versa

3502 :  displeasing traits that we dont want to face that we dont want to

3503 :  its in many ways more complex and evolved

3504 :  were already doing this with mice were already doing this with bats i think we should start doing it with sperm

3505 :  weve had our current size brain around two hundred thousand years

3506 :  it just doesnt work

3507 :  they found that also these sperm whales can cram one thousand six hundred micro clicks

3508 :  its this secret language

3509 :  let me know when your album drops

3510 :  when i was very young my mom bought a banjo

3511 :  what im trying to say is if you made a mix tape or put something on itunes i would totally buy

3512 :  when i was awake with the camera around my neck

3513 :  and thats led me to doing some work with the physical world not with the internet and only using the internet at the very last moment as

3514 :  i photographed that entire experience at five minute intervals

3515 :  i mean in real life things are much more nuanced and complex and theres all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each

3516 :  so bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high level

3517 :  and recently ive become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story

3518 :  so every five minutes i took a photograph

3519 :  so ill be talking about each of those today

3520 :  but if you think about real life its not like that at all

3521 :  so really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story

3522 :  that was the first concept here

3523 :  but you know even holding one balloon is like kind of happy

3524 :  its called we feel fine

3525 :  and theyre actually still flying up there today

3526 :  and this is what she said

3527 :  and up there there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years

3528 :  the second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story

3529 :  i call this my peace formula

3530 :  as its evident it worked for me

3531 :  when i was fourteen i murdered mr

3532 :  at my understanding that my grandson was responsible for the murder of this human being i went to the prayer closet like i was

3533 :  the programs that we have in the tariq khamisa foundation provide so many tools for the kids to put in their toolkit

3534 :  we have an after school mentoring program and we create a peace club

3535 :  its fifty percent above the category average

3536 :  and thats not surprising if you think about the basket case that is the e

3537 :  so whats happening now in the digital age is that we can quantify value in lots of different ways and do it more easily

3538 :  so that brings me back to the connection with sweat

3539 :  youve bought into it

3540 :  and its currently around that kind of one hundred and ten dollar mark in value

3541 :  hes almost like the banksy of the internet

3542 :  so thats a sort of starbucks currency staying within its ecosystem

3543 :  you think about rewards schemes air miles

3544 :  they say that is trust

3545 :  so in one level it went from something like thirteen dollars to two hundred and sixtysix literally in the space of four months and then crashed and

3546 :  this is purely for the community that are sweating using nike products

3547 :  its infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive and

3548 :  theyre not advertising loud messages at you and thats where advertising has started to shift now is into things like services tools

3549 :  no one knows who or what he is

3550 :  and you cant come into this

3551 :  is technology making paper money feel outmoded

3552 :  are we decoupling money from the government

3553 :  you cant buy stuff with pesos

3554 :  when they spot tide theres a shortcut

3555 :  so i really think that as we learn more its going to turn out that the whole fly brain is just like a

3556 :  i used to study mice

3557 :  and the basic punchline of my talk is id like to turn that over on its head

3558 :  i think this is a fascinating behavior that shows how fast the flys brain can process information

3559 :  i grew up in baltimore and i chew crabs very very well

3560 :  i love star trek

3561 :  its a non spiking cell

3562 :  i grew up watching star trek

3563 :  what are they

3564 :  you come from a tribe somewhere you come from a people somewhere

3565 :  and as i look out to the audience and ive had an opportunity to visit with many of you today there are so many races

3566 :  your family has stories

3567 :  i didnt ask him if he got seasick his daughter gets seasick and i just wondered if he did

3568 :  we take a more holistic approach to life and everything that we do

3569 :  so why do we do this project

3570 :  well thats the end of my talk

3571 :  they flash up into my memory just like google for pictures

3572 :  and where i was bad was algebra

3573 :  they cant see that stuff inside the tail

3574 :  i was a goofball student when i was in high school

3575 :  its literally movies in your head

3576 :  well if youre building a bridge details are pretty important because itll fall down if you ignore the details

3577 :  thats the kind of specificity you need

3578 :  and i was never allowed to take geometry or trig

3579 :  and when the pilots walk around the plane guess what

3580 :  you could have a horse thats been abused by a rider

3581 :  and thats shown very very nicely in the movie

3582 :  you know the slaughter plants i worked with in the 80s they were absolutely awful

3583 :  i mean art was my best subject in school

3584 :  think about how much information there is on the local fire hydrant

3585 :  that would not be a reasonable thing for them to do

3586 :  you just have to learn it

3587 :  we need to be doing that

3588 :  yeah im a million mile flier

3589 :  and now their stocks are projected to double in the next few years

3590 :  in two thousand and nine i started a research position with nokia

3591 :  and nobody knows if they really can live forever or what keeps them from aging

3592 :  so its really interesting

3593 :  now i dont want you all to go out taking rapamycin

3594 :  its more like that

3595 :  it is a drug for people but the reason is it suppresses the immune system

3596 :  so he doesnt actually do anything himself

3597 :  and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic the

3598 :  were harnessing energy from the sun

3599 :  i found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe

3600 :  maybe youve had that experience as well

3601 :  so thats what i did

3602 :  its essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain

3603 :  we gain and lose synapses all the time through a process called neural plasticity

3604 :  in some of these brains scientists discovered something surprising

3605 :  a single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta

3606 :  now everyone look at two people

3607 :  so what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point

3608 :  i think the answer is no

3609 :  soon after i finished running this experiment i went to talk to a big software company in

3610 :  and they came up with all kinds of ideas

3611 :  and you would speculate that the people who love legos would build more legos even for less money because after all they get more

3612 :  so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning

3613 :  i said how many of you now go home earlier than you used to

3614 :  but it turns out they were very unpopular

3615 :  if you think about it there are some people who love legos and some people who dont

3616 :  also if you look at prison movies sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners

3617 :  think about it

3618 :  so that means that one out of ten lost manufacturing jobs was due

3619 :  in fact automation is spreading to every production line in every country around the world

3620 :  mike lost his job to a machine

3621 :  we heard a lot about this during the two thousand and sixteen presidential election

3622 :  im a supply chain professional and i live and work in mexico

3623 :  so lets apply this process to the corporate world

3624 :  some have blamed trade for some of the problems weve been having here at home in the us

3625 :  now this approach to processing goes on all around the world to manufacture many of the products

3626 :  recently weve heard a number of countries talk about restricting imports and protecting their

3627 :  think about how your house was built or your kitchen renovated

3628 :  i look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past

3629 :  its a proper noun

3630 :  a selfie whatever

3631 :  the point is it goes into a pile

3632 :  the journalism platforms that weve used for centuries are disposable

3633 :  and then he said something that really shocked me

3634 :  its update after another update

3635 :  and i believe that the main thing that needs to happen for that reimagining to be successful

3636 :  i said what was it

3637 :  and when the light broke we could see it as well

3638 :  the answer is rarely inside the building

3639 :  our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them

3640 :  theyll always find the shortcut

3641 :  i think its because students are always late and theyre pretty smart

3642 :  so theyre dashing to lectures

3643 :  now university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths

3644 :  you all have a choice

3645 :  i knew that i had to start involving patients in this process or they would never learn

3646 :  the most important part of all this is the dynamic of getting people around a table

3647 :  could you have asked for a better answer to prayer

3648 :  he picked up a gi illness and had pretty significant vomiting and diarrhea

3649 :  even for a big cut on your arm

3650 :  and there are considerations besides cost

3651 :  because the er has to be fully prepared with specialists training medications and equipment for

3652 :  a skilled nurse practitioner can replace a feeding tube that came out or stopped working

3653 :  and the cost for individuals is high as well

3654 :  we could even say that it is a thought experiment which is at the origin of modern science in the

3655 :  but you may ask

3656 :  but they could afford a mortgage on a modest property they could afford to run a car and they could afford to feed and clothe

3657 :  and that sounds stupid but there is actually some really good evidence to support that theory that the two are

3658 :  and young minds a charity that works in the uk in two thousand and fourteen did exactly that

3659 :  and the problem about conversations surrounding advertising is that nobody ever acknowledges that the impact is cumulative

3660 :  take for example last week

3661 :  im one third of an organization called the self esteem team and we travel schools and colleges throughout the uk and

3662 :  when i was born in one thousand nine hundred and eightyone my dad had a market store and my mum was an assistant buyer for a

3663 :  they surveyed five thousand young people

3664 :  but instead our government decided to aspire to an education system like they have in korea where

3665 :  in scandinavia you dont go to school until you are eight

3666 :  we know that hospitalizations for self harm and eating disorders have doubled in the past three years

3667 :  you say whats causing this

3668 :  she looks lovely i dont see the problem

3669 :  so they havent hurt themselves as severely as us but for us it meant that we broke our legs

3670 :  there are so many toxic ideas that permeate our society the narrative by which we

3671 :  you cant get away from that

3672 :  we also incidentally trail behind countries in scandinavia in numeracy and literacy

3673 :  you take your phone out and you know immediately where to go

3674 :  however the app also assumes there are only a handful of directions to the

3675 :  and dont get me wrong mapping apps are the greatest game changer for encouraging people to

3676 :  and once upon a time i think i was treating my sawyer and avery like little bonsai

3677 :  ive got two kids i mentioned sawyer and avery

3678 :  you gotta say what was great about lunch today

3679 :  they need to know they matter to us as humans not because of their gpa

3680 :  in fact im not very interested in parenting per se

3681 :  why dont you do that

3682 :  i got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew

3683 :  you write the check and instantly it depreciates thirty percent

3684 :  by the middle of the 19th century its in full flower

3685 :  maybe two years if you read eight hours a day

3686 :  that happens in the building industry as well

3687 :  what dont you do this

3688 :  apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste

3689 :  so we told all our friends about it

3690 :  and the marker of giftivism is that is for the one hundred
3691 :  all these people recognized that

3692 :  and i think gandhi tackles this spot on in one sentence there is enough for everyones need

3693 :  and these guys actually do a lot of amazing interesting stuff

3694 :  what was the force

3695 :  what that meant was that instead of showing value we would just focus on adding value

3696 :  that we are selfish

3697 :  what would emerge if we turn this question on its head

3698 :  id like to contribute

3699 :  is this a fundraiser

3700 :  he ended up walking seventy thousand kilometers

3701 :  so they decide to do an experiment

3702 :  they start to connect they start to bond

3703 :  lets not fundraise

3704 :  and julio says im about to go to have dinner

3705 :  how much would you pay

3706 :  we can categorize it like that

3707 :  they need psychiatric help

3708 :  where do we like to kiss people

3709 :  and it takes time but we have had some small success stories with these people too

3710 :  we are trying to change what we can with gentle pushing and pulling but were not willing to push it to the point where were

3711 :  id like to talk to you today about the mitrovica rock school in kosovo

3712 :  but the fact is that almost immediately after the war bands started to

3713 :  when musicians without borders first arrived in mitrovica we were asked to help revive the citys rock

3714 :  but they were forbidden by authorities at the time to promote the single with a gig

3715 :  whats the smallest thing we can do to make the biggest difference

3716 :  first of all the tesco people thought i had the biggest carb habit in the world

3717 :  about fifteen years ago i was writing a book called change activist

3718 :  weve got magic breakfast three hundred and sixtyfive
3719 :  we also want to tackle holiday hunger

3720 :  has this made any difference at all

3721 :  sometimes they give us something and sometimes they dont

3722 :  theres nothing wrong with not wanting to be killed by the police

3723 :  thats what i do

3724 :  we have to find out the truth about this organization for ourselves and i encourage you to do that

3725 :  it wounded several people

3726 :  and the book has this picture on the cover

3727 :  i knew that when i was driving this car back from iowa i was going to have to pass through this town so i took the

3728 :  they wanted blacks to be tried by juries of their peers because to that point they were being tried by all whites

3729 :  maybe if you call the u

3730 :  they would work with these organizations and set up the same kinds of programs in their communities

3731 :  and then i hear my name over the intercom

3732 :  so we have to ask ourselves what is it about this organization

3733 :  and i said ok

3734 :  you probably saw this a few weeks ago

3735 :  and i have a nice place to live

3736 :  i would say it was like losing a loved one because i suffered terrible grief and i kept

3737 :  and i gained insight and i realised that there is always hope

3738 :  always lead by example

3739 :  and at the same time i thought i was losing my mind because i was even thinking like that

3740 :  is an individual capable of change

3741 :  and was extremely fed up with society how people are always wanting people always expecting in a

3742 :  i refused to use healthy alternatives to deal with or reduce my stress and i continued burying all

3743 :  and at that point in time i figured i had no choice because i didnt know what else to do

3744 :  and sometimes you need to step out of your comfort zone

3745 :  there are a lot of factors that must be in the right place at the right time but change can happen

3746 :  how will that matter

3747 :  because people can change

3748 :  the majority of us all have

3749 :  they can turn themselves around

3750 :  and you could be the person who has the positive effect on someone that makes them stop and think its worth it

3751 :  we are all just one small drop in this vast ocean of humanity and one

3752 :  we have created such a situation artificially

3753 :  we can now actually interfere with their psychology in rather profound ways as ill show you in my last

3754 :  we need to rearrange the pattern

3755 :  the three essential components of a decentralized legal system are

3756 :  it took about one minute

3757 :  and they masturbated

3758 :  it was remarkable

3759 :  what food can we eat

3760 :  then you decide you wouldnt mind a few more

3761 :  and so what we want to do now is to prepare for that future by developing tools and attitudes that

3762 :  and we see this all around us

3763 :  strangely enough i always get the same three answers

3764 :  we agree on a global scale what the answers are to these isolated facts

3765 :  why is google the search engine of choice for you

3766 :  its not true

3767 :  and last but not least thirdly inevitably one student will raise her or his hand and say

3768 :  you dont see a big conspiracy among those things

3769 :  so whenever you set out to google something start by asking yourself this am i looking for an isolated fact

3770 :  this is when we start to argue to form society

3771 :  and this is where it becomes interesting because this is where we become human

3772 :  and i dont think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea

3773 :  however google didnt settle for that this time they just thought thats racist and its a bad search result and were

3774 :  great google away

3775 :  there was a picture distributed widely over the internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey

3776 :  lets teach google that thats the face of the terrorist

3777 :  but let me first elaborate just a little bit on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to

3778 :  we believe in you we dont believe in you

3779 :  and my message goes out not only to google but to all believers in the faith of code around the world

3780 :  and if nothing else to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased clean search result

3781 :  jpeg or the like

3782 :  i want you to think

3783 :  in one thousand nine hundred and fortynine antonio moniz got the nobel prize for an

3784 :  if you operate upon it at a smaller size the risk with the operation

3785 :  and the variation is four hundred and eighty
3786 :  so this is it just follow now

3787 :  but film and video does flatten sculpture so i tried to imagine a way that

3788 :  on the count of five

3789 :  one two three four five

3790 :  that was the first one only four to go

3791 :  in just one or two words

3792 :  hold it dont release it yet

3793 :  look we can all agree that the unexamined life is not worth living but if all youre

3794 :  so since you all did so well we have time for just a little bit of extra credit

3795 :  dont release it yet

3796 :  what do you love to do

3797 :  what do they want or need

3798 :  what do all those people want or need

3799 :  youre going to know your life purpose now in the next five minutes

3800 :  now were going to put this all together kind of in a sentence ok

3801 :  thats what you do

3802 :  that formulation forces you to be outward facing

3803 :  its that transactional thing where its like

3804 :  on the count of five how do they change or transform as a result of what you give them

3805 :  now this is the best one

3806 :  how do they change

3807 :  so when people ask you this question so what do you do

3808 :  who do you do it for

3809 :  and the aim of all this is to raise a generation of people able to come up with new ideas to face the

3810 :  we all know

3811 :  but again the good news is now we have scientific tools to investigate this equilibrium

3812 :  and it failed because of the great complexity of the underlying phenomenon

3813 :  its not something we can predefine

3814 :  so let me start with an example

3815 :  what is better when were talking about a human being

3816 :  and so i hope at these meetings that there will be a role for the public to bring their voice to bear as

3817 :  its a tough question

3818 :  theyre studying human disease and other important elements of science

3819 :  so theres a lot of good research going on with crispr

3820 :  and in fact to some extent youre right

3821 :  why is that

3822 :  because methane is a greenhouse gas however the half

3823 :  what if i were right

3824 :  when lash affirmed my calculations the first salvo of the fracking

3825 :  let me illustrate this for you

3826 :  without their efforts this would not be possible

3827 :  this was staggering

3828 :  its part of our survival package and thats why its become so important for us and thats why were

3829 :  interestingly when your opening line of communication is hey listen up because im about to drop some serious knowledge on

3830 :  i was visiting with joel the weekend before the copenhagen conference on climate change opened in december of

3831 :  if i had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum id say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies

3832 :  why is this remotely controversial

3833 :  now let me give you an example from my act

3834 :  and theres this mental delight thats followed by the physical response of laughter which not coincidentally

3835 :  time after time whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon to be grateful recipient

3836 :  ever since i can remember thinking consciously about such things communication has been my central passion

3837 :  i have some material about the so called radical gay agenda which starts off by asking how radical

3838 :  which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when i realized that i was being swept

3839 :  it takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom and transforms it through ridicule into a different

3840 :  but not so with m rquez who once praised his translators versions as being better than his own

3841 :  even as a child i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to

3842 :  and i heard the exact same punchline on both coasts something about the ignited negro college

3843 :  the description perfectly captured edwards personal vanity

3844 :  there are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect

3845 :  its highly recommended for anyone whos interested in the translators art

3846 :  but back in two thousand and nine the question joel and i kept turning over and over was why this late in the game

3847 :  two days after that

3848 :  people cant wait to pass along that new great joke

3849 :  because from what i can tell the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military get married and

3850 :  comedy has been crossing country with remarkable speed way before the internet social media

3851 :  and he used to be the usa today monday morning guy

3852 :  and guess what

3853 :  and not long after that he got another request for a copy from the head of the epa in california who used

3854 :  and earlier this year he got a request from the green party in australia who used it in their campaign

3855 :  why is this such a complex problem

3856 :  do you invest everything that you have all of your money potentially going even further into debt into an investment in

3857 :  africa is the largest arable land mass on the planet

3858 :  a lack of progress in this area has not been for a lack of trying

3859 :  why is that

3860 :  helpfulness is why the firm sap thinks they can answer any question in seventeen minutes

3861 :  they were commissioned to build the equestrian center for the beijing olympics

3862 :  the building had to receive two thousand five hundred highly strung rather neurotic

3863 :  motivating people by money has to go too

3864 :  everybody has a valid perspective

3865 :  that the bonds of social sensitivity mutual support loyalty and trust make a

3866 :  but what was really interesting is that the really successful groups were not the ones that had one or two people

3867 :  companies dont have ideas only people do

3868 :  and it was only really when we stopped working and we spent time invested

3869 :  and when i visited firms renowned for their ingenuity and creativity i couldnt even see the

3870 :  instead its a bit like a baby

3871 :  there were no passengers and neither did anyone dominate everybody contributed fully

3872 :  and logos and mission statements dont motivate anybody

3873 :  and we wont solve the problems that we face by waiting for individual supermen or

3874 :  they brought hundreds of people in

3875 :  frank maslin the head of engineering said there will be no stars on this team

3876 :  now we need everybody

3877 :  it was a billion dollar business

3878 :  the term derives from a sociologist who studied communities and identified why was it that some

3879 :  oscar buzz doing great at the box office a consensus idea of what a quality

3880 :  i recommend it to all of you

3881 :  do you remember what the critics said when brave came out

3882 :  theres no models for them

3883 :  why are you still standing there

3884 :  it has not yet caught on and caught fire but maybe today we will start a movement

3885 :  aw i cant believe pixar made a princess movie

3886 :  maybe its not just the sparkly dress

3887 :  so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this some new relationship with each other and i think

3888 :  the movies are very very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward and theres not a lot of room

3889 :  it pretty much flunks the bechdel test

3890 :  i finished my quest i got the girl

3891 :  theyre throwing it up in the air

3892 :  thats what allowed my miracle wheat to get out to people

3893 :  because in the 1860s it was understood how the two went together and what impact they

3894 :  roads and rice

3895 :  im telling them these stories and i said look africa and south asia are going to be facing

3896 :  the secretary general of the united nations came to des moines to help present our

3897 :  and there were still twentyfive thousand khmer rouge all over the countryside

3898 :  i had to go to vietnam to learn it but i should have known it and all of you should know it because it is the

3899 :  youre absolutely right

3900 :  roads and wheat

3901 :  i was invited to address the united nations on world food day

3902 :  where the road ends the insurgency begins

3903 :  thats what transforms rural areas

3904 :  they wanted to know how they could buy a copy of that statue of borlaug and put it up on their campus

3905 :  thirty years from now

3906 :  i dont want to study labor relations

3907 :  i dont want to go to western europe

3908 :  so we had this bond that kept us together

3909 :  sure if you want to go to mount everest go walk up to base camp wave at the summit

3910 :  take my story for example

3911 :  luckily it didnt come to that

3912 :  and sure the usual suspects are to blame

3913 :  i think it was the right decision

3914 :  so i sat down with my parents at the same kitchen table where my brothers and sisters had voted to bring me home fourteen
3915 :  now id had a couple of operations before then

3916 :  and i went in to his studio and looked at this massive portrait of my face and

3917 :  in terms of participation in society its probably the fact that i have no legs that has more of an

3918 :  so what they told my parents was look

3919 :  it can not feed the world for one

3920 :  sometimes we hire people who have the languages but often we train

3921 :  and i think mix we can

3922 :  they can be portable

3923 :  he used to say we are all going to be walking on moving sands

3924 :  so it was the liquid lands that needed feminism and activism and human rights and

3925 :  its called synesthesia

3926 :  and what about motherland

3927 :  i got some bad news

3928 :  we are not equipped for the 21st century

3929 :  there is some good news

3930 :  i dont live in a township

3931 :  but my point is if we dont talk about this stuff and we dont learn how to deal with our lives its not going to be one in four

3932 :  what once made you safe now drives you insane

3933 :  so heres my question

3934 :  but thats not what happened

3935 :  so people seem to think that technology is nothing more than this candy store they can go into and if they

3936 :  and you put this on top of another piece of paper thats coated with silver nitrate and you expose the back to some

3937 :  it means room

3938 :  i have to tell it because there was no one to put two and two together

3939 :  this was an opportunity

3940 :  i didnt say goodbye to anybody not my mother my father my sisters my brothers my aunts my uncles my cousins my

3941 :  i dont mean children

3942 :  i mean the child of the state

3943 :  so this was an opportunity

3944 :  the mother and babys homes were often run by nuns

3945 :  i hadnt done anything wrong

3946 :  i wasnt charged for anything

3947 :  i found all of my family in my adult life

3948 :  i was starting to stay out a little bit late etc

3949 :  margaret thatcher was my mother

3950 :  i saw light

3951 :  but heres the catch

3952 :  every hotel in the city is exactly the same

3953 :  its up to us to start the process

3954 :  time and time again random strangers went out of their way to help us out or

3955 :  one of my first creative writing teachers told me that what i was writing wasnt poetry and to change it

3956 :  such as those by james magnussen or roy mcavoy

3957 :  and if you watched the brazilian players their heads dropped

3958 :  heres another example

3959 :  perhaps he was not very confident inside when he should have been supremely confident of his

3960 :  so relaxation techniques are extremely important in this regard and psychologists will work with athletes to try

3961 :  it was incredibly impressive to watch

3962 :  theres a number of strategies that athletes can use to boost their confidence

3963 :  what happens when things go wrong

3964 :  and thats because having goals that are realistic relevant specific measurable and so forth

3965 :  you want to switch jobs or work less

3966 :  but we didnt have money in the first place

3967 :  did you ever sell anything that you had to buy back

3968 :  on magnetic island we were staying at a little b amp b after taking a ferry to get out there

3969 :  some of us buy clothes some of us buy gadgets most of us buy vacations to warm places just to

3970 :  all of this acquisition of the next thing the next new version

3971 :  it meant a connection to the world

3972 :  three hundred years ago hed have been burnt at the stake for that

3973 :  thats why the prime minister went on television

3974 :  now hes gone

3975 :  and making sense of the financial crisis is very very difficult

3976 :  and shes desperate to find more evidence for the link

3977 :  i just think thats important

3978 :  it has fish thats all

3979 :  it didnt have that kind of collateral

3980 :  its rather like that line in the film as good as it gets

3981 :  you know it inspires us

3982 :  so what i thought id do is in honor of emmanuel is what i can do is to

3983 :  shes running out of time she said

3984 :  and whats more your wife has just run off with your best friend

3985 :  and being english when i first heard that i thought what a load of cock

3986 :  yesterday david deutsch another one who covered most of what i was going to say

3987 :  so its extraordinary

3988 :  thats eight years of american history eight minutes of my act just gone like that

3989 :  we have a new man

3990 :  so when that didnt work out i had to make a few arrangements let me tell you

3991 :  so where do we look for inspiration

3992 :  its a new world thats very very difficult to make sense of

3993 :  but you know hes gone

3994 :  your house has caught fire

3995 :  you know its the end of an error sic

3996 :  this whole what ben bernanke has said the chaotic unwinding of the worlds financial system its

3997 :  for an extremely acoustic animal like dolphins long time exposure to noise will result in

3998 :  and that results in different culture and complex social structure in different dolphin

3999 :  they have confronted the authority

4000 :  i am a nomadic artist

4001 :  i work in morocco in turkey in mexico

4002 :  so in a way by studying a woman you can read the structure and the ideology of the country

4003 :  its an important skill set

4004 :  with this victory the villagers gained confidence and once again began to pass on their traditions to their

4005 :  from my own experience i knew how valuable rites of passage were for young people

4006 :  and that night many nearby villages did the same and when the wardens came this time they threw up their

4007 :  the reason why this works so well is that it speeds up your decision making and catapults you

4008 :  do it badly frees you up to take action

4009 :  it took the anxiety out of everything and replaced it with excitement

4010 :  ill show you what i mean

4011 :  this will probably make you feel a little bit anxious and youll probably want to start running

4012 :  how people perceive us

4013 :  every problem out there somebody has the idea for

4014 :  im like you have two cars and they dont have license plate protectors

4015 :  i open up chapter eight talking about budgeting

4016 :  do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the ceo disease

4017 :  im not going to see you waste a penny

4018 :  ted turners got it

4019 :  if i couldnt sell all four i could at least get one

4020 :  remember im nine years old

4021 :  then my dad would drive me on saturdays to a scrap metal recycler where i got paid

4022 :  at seven years old i figured it out

4023 :  and then you know what we do

4024 :  we wouldnt have that stuff right

4025 :  so i knew there were two cars with two license plates on each

4026 :  i had the pinnacles ddhs and the really cool ones

4027 :  it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world

4028 :  attention deficit disorder bipolar disorder

4029 :  and then id sell fifty at a time of all the crappy ones

4030 :  youve got this demand over here that has money

4031 :  so theres a recession

4032 :  and i collected it from the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle

4033 :  that doesnt make sense

4034 :  i packaged them up three ways

4035 :  that was cool because then i had retail outlets

4036 :  i said but youve got two cars

4037 :  i stole essays

4038 :  so i just packaged them

4039 :  they teach them to work in corporations

4040 :  steve jobs has it

4041 :  i even knew at seven years old that i could get a fractional percent of a cent and people would pay it because it

4042 :  we went down to the basement and i opened up this cupboard

4043 :  go get some of that

4044 :  we figure out the game

4045 :  sorry entrepreneurs arent students

4046 :  every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker

4047 :  i cheated on exams

4048 :  so whos starting these companies

4049 :  those sold for two dollars each

4050 :  its like a recession

4051 :  im like twelve right

4052 :  dont try to sell to the poor kids they dont have cash

4053 :  and i would like to qualify that idea

4054 :  so why to engage in dialogue

4055 :  so i thought hes our guy

4056 :  but im also going to give you a personal more individual reason

4057 :  so thats how we should relate to others

4058 :  they dreamed of becoming a mother since they were old enough to emulate their own mothers and grandmothers

4059 :  a few days after madison died i blogged about my to do list for the upcoming day

4060 :  many of these women were just like me

4061 :  for me it was a guarantee

4062 :  i am a voice

4063 :  you didnt know that baby anyway

4064 :  motherhood was not just a dream

4065 :  and your journey is simple its made of steps

4066 :  thats the best way

4067 :  well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn the prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical

4068 :  its too hard

4069 :  so we developed an idea a rationale that perhaps if we made a molecule that prevented the post it

4070 :  this research is funded by the public

4071 :  and the very unsatisfying yet scientific answer is

4072 :  yet comparatively we have about a dozen targeted medications

4073 :  we thought wed just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves

4074 :  yet this information is largely a secret

4075 :  the first is

4076 :  why is that

4077 :  and were able finally to answer the question thats been so pressing for so many years

4078 :  and one thing ive learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer and i love that

4079 :  why do i have cancer

4080 :  we dont have a team of salespeople and marketeers to tell us how to position this drug against the other

4081 :  dont quit your day job

4082 :  unfortunate assumption number one is

4083 :  they told him

4084 :  so i took this assessment called the eq profile and one of the things the eq profile does is it

4085 :  so this is how it shows up for me

4086 :  well once i had a taste of feedback i realized i wanted more because if i had one way of being that wasnt

4087 :  we have a chapter on gels

4088 :  but now you will we put a biography of james watt in

4089 :  it turned out he was hired by a scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the

4090 :  and its a wonderful thing

4091 :  of course youre not actually working the whole time

4092 :  so its a great illustration of that

4093 :  thats whats happening to the water inside that popcorn

4094 :  buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference

4095 :  they are making lots of distinctions all the time

4096 :  in fact we are not really very good letting them walk to school anymore by themselves even though there are fewer

4097 :  and that number hasnt really changed in recent years

4098 :  there are no examples

4099 :  the autobiographical self is built on the basis of past memories and memories of the

4100 :  only the wealth of our minds is not the very fact that we have a self that we can

4101 :  so from the retina you go onto visual cortex

4102 :  thats where the difference is

4103 :  but then i am a skeptic

4104 :  they are awesome creatures

4105 :  it became known as simons shark slime

4106 :  nine and a half thousand kilometers we never thought that happened

4107 :  sunfish is one of the words for basking sharks

4108 :  now not all of these things will work in local jihad

4109 :  more often than not its a power struggle in one country or even a small region within one country

4110 :  who killed bin ladenism

4111 :  but they have been distracted recently

4112 :  i live in new york now

4113 :  we dont have to go back to that

4114 :  he made it our problem

4115 :  they had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers the towers coming down

4116 :  ive looked up the term self determination and as far as i can tell

4117 :  what i say is this

4118 :  others say that granting equality to the palestinians and allowing the refugees a right of

4119 :  but then the follow up question

4120 :  so far what we have done is we want to know what works

4121 :  oh look at those toes

4122 :  you may never catch up

4123 :  oh bless your heart ill take care of that

4124 :  they went into the homes of fortytwo families and they had an intense observation

4125 :  in wic you dont just get a little plastic card and go to the grocery store and do whatever you want

4126 :  it involves united way it involves the anne e

4127 :  we have a wic office capable of reaching these people

4128 :  and all those low risk mothers

4129 :  oh your diaper needs to be changed

4130 :  i believe itll work but what we want to know is does it really work

4131 :  ive known i wanted to be a doctor from age eight

4132 :  language is the very basis of solving the problem of poverty

4133 :  but by providing accessible and respectful prenatal care jennie has achieved something remarkable

4134 :  and because im latina and a spanish speaker in my first volunteer doula gig at a public hospital in north

4135 :  but when i tell people about these appalling statistics im usually met with an assumption that its about either

4136 :  she sees her staff as part of a team that alongside the woman and her family has one goal

4137 :  remember those statistics i told you that black women are more likely to give birth too early to give birth to low birth weight

4138 :  i became a doula a lay person trained to provide support to people during pregnancy and childbirth

4139 :  theres also a growing body of research showing that people who experience more discrimination

4140 :  the solution is called the jj way

4141 :  its what researchers call the immigrant paradox and it further illustrates that theres something in the us environment that is making

4142 :  that we is actually a really crucial aspect of jennies model

4143 :  we cant have you not eating

4144 :  even the threat of discrimination like worrying you might be stopped by police while driving your car

4145 :  no one is turned away due to lack of funds

4146 :  well youd be wrong

4147 :  now lets imagine for a moment that i was pregnant

4148 :  as trina deflated the blood pressure cuff she said well see about changing your prescription ok

4149 :  they involve elaborate physiological mechanisms meant to protect us that when overstimulated actually make us sick

4150 :  their approach is casual and friendly

4151 :  no one is chastised for showing up late to their appointments

4152 :  and there were actually venture capitalists to help to see if there are any projects to

4153 :  i also talked to my colleagues who have actually been to hackathons

4154 :  from all the information that i gathered i organized my first hackathon in two thousand and thirteen themed open york data

4155 :  so that way people like you dont have to pay hundreds of dollars to read a research article

4156 :  the person who came up with this app timeify felt that the ad was exclusive it was only meant for those certain

4157 :  so trying to pave my way away from myself as a librarian trying to find a way to outreach to students and to

4158 :  what it shows you is that anybody can be a hacker

4159 :  there were still judges and mentors to help them critically evaluate their outcomes

4160 :  and they were starting to get hackathon mania

4161 :  we actually have an underground pathway that i consider a maze i have never been down there

4162 :  they were trying to build an app to help students find their way around campus

4163 :  a hacker is somebody who sees a problem who has an obstacle that they are trying to overcome who likes to take

4164 :  so at centennial college where i currently work i worked with the applied research and innovation center to organize a

4165 :  he wanted to change that

4166 :  so what or who is a hacker

4167 :  and yes join a hackathon

4168 :  they had to think of concepts and ideas they had to think of design issues and they also had to think of business aspects

4169 :  even the mind is emotional

4170 :  and its like espresso coffee you know you take the essence of the coffee

4171 :  there is so many interests

4172 :  thats what expression is

4173 :  and we live in a world which is connecting us more and more

4174 :  and architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere

4175 :  if you think of the great buildings of the cathedrals of the temples of the pyramids of pagodas of cities

4176 :  its based on wonder

4177 :  and i think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses

4178 :  and yet i believe it is the expression expression of the city expression of our own space that gives

4179 :  we applaud the well mannered box

4180 :  and yet at the end its so hard to change a wall

4181 :  and i think that is indeed what architecture is

4182 :  there is so many interests

4183 :  we can create incredible things

4184 :  so the reality of architecture is visceral

4185 :  and i think thats really what architecture is based on

4186 :  i came from the bronx

4187 :  its such a complex project

4188 :  we would not know which way we were going and why we are going where were going

4189 :  its an art of communication

4190 :  there is so many parties to this project

4191 :  and of course we are all about the struggle of emotions

4192 :  you have to fight for what you believe

4193 :  by some of our fellow species including prairie dogs

4194 :  you can see this affect in children that are just two and one two years old

4195 :  and they start talking and one of them says hey has anybody tried to listen for this thing

4196 :  so when they were sitting in front of the microscope when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler and all these things

4197 :  i mean here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch this little passion that had developed

4198 :  it will be useful in two thousand and twenty
4199 :  so the technology is there

4200 :  and these two guys are named guier and weiffenbach

4201 :  i cant believe this has happened

4202 :  we should record it

4203 :  so they started to think could we build a neonatal incubator thats built entirely out of

4204 :  and so guier and weiffenbach go back to weiffenbachs office and they start kind of noodling around hacking as we might call it now

4205 :  and the question is how do you get your brain into environments where these new networks are going to be more likely to

4206 :  it was right at twenty mhz so you could pick it up really easily because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax basically

4207 :  and worse is when economics is debated like metaphysics as if any real system is just a bad example of the ideal

4208 :  the future on offer is one in which everything can change so long as everything stays the same

4209 :  this is incredibly conservative

4210 :  were told that not only is change accelerating but that the pace of change is accelerating

4211 :  a fleeting moment of wonder

4212 :  another futurism is possible

4213 :  both can be much more intelligent

4214 :  a sense that maybe its all going to work out after all

4215 :  communism in theory was an egalitarian utopia

4216 :  what does the ted audience hope to get from this

4217 :  and efficient to whom

4218 :  whats great about this is the tools to do this are free

4219 :  the first step in doing that is figuring out how many visitors your destination can actually hold

4220 :  better for the traveler better for the destination better for the stakeholders

4221 :  youre going to stockholm

4222 :  but let me ask this

4223 :  and destinations want to offer something different

4224 :  other stakeholders want more tourists as well

4225 :  its not just the airlines and the hotels

4226 :  and if tourism hopes to have a lucrative future we have to treat tourists and visitors with respect

4227 :  thats their unique selling proposition

4228 :  which is the traditional way of doing it

4229 :  something we dont have at home

4230 :  you want to think of it more like this

4231 :  i thought okay im going to take this

4232 :  i dont know why but i love it

4233 :  it creates what we call a metabolic flexibility and it really allows you to be able to eat and match what youre burning

4234 :  can i fix whats wrong

4235 :  they all come to my office and they want to know why

4236 :  lastly youve got to make it easy

4237 :  what i found actually changed the course of my career

4238 :  and when she comes in she hopes that when she sprinkles it on her food tonight she actually will eat a little

4239 :  and she really paints a picture of someone thats just getting by someone thats just doing the minimal someone that just is

4240 :  but it does

4241 :  shes lost seventyfive pounds on three separate occasions

4242 :  a very unique group

4243 :  theyve tied it to something that they really value

4244 :  theyve tied it to a higher purpose

4245 :  it can totally change our society

4246 :  and its your body and mind

4247 :  i was able to really study why these behaviors stick in these people when they dont stick in other

4248 :  so what did we learn

4249 :  the relationship with her husband isnt what it should be

4250 :  so in colorado we also have a great mindset

4251 :  you look wonderful

4252 :  no one wants to talk about weight loss maintenance no one wants to prepare for weight loss maintenance and no one is going to buy or use a

4253 :  when your kids hang around people that smoke guess what happens

4254 :  and part of this i think is because people really like to lose weight

4255 :  theyre the ones that no one can do this

4256 :  theyve decided that these lifestyles mean so much more

4257 :  but in colorado guess what

4258 :  maintaining the weight loss is hard

4259 :  people wonder dont you want to sign with a major label

4260 :  and often i get asked questions so what does the future hold

4261 :  you see what happened is in the 1970s at the olympics all these records had

4262 :  it was tested in blind studies with humans

4263 :  then through this i learned one really important lesson that through the internet anything is possible

4264 :  the internet is becoming accessible to three
4265 :  five billion more people

4266 :  i expected id waltz into that lab it would magically work in like the first week

4267 :  and thats next to impossible

4268 :  but in my opinion we are just getting started

4269 :  is driving the world into like this freefall and were going to unclear and like just explode

4270 :  thats whats happening nowadays

4271 :  all these records are broken

4272 :  that was the big question here

4273 :  do you want to know why

4274 :  when they have access to the internet they could be like me

4275 :  in addition you have to pay for doctors fees and all of these subordinate associated fees with that

4276 :  there are millions more of me out there

4277 :  five billion people could do and just imagine what you could do

4278 :  why film dance in the streets

4279 :  and the first thing he asked them is do you speak hebrew

4280 :  when you watch her power move

4281 :  why are we doing this

4282 :  pretty much putting yourself into the genesis of that locations timeline

4283 :  what i assumed when i watched the policeman walk up is that you know i was in trouble or something but he wasnt thinking

4284 :  like that is done and we have to delete our footage

4285 :  this is when were filming and people dont really know what to say as the filmings happening but they approach us afterwards and ask

4286 :  because in the streets is where theres history of locations themselves and the ability for you to capture

4287 :  it needed to be a little more elegant a little more classical so i rendered it as follows

4288 :  this guy is an american

4289 :  and so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase

4290 :  the great thing about learning chinese is that your chinese teacher gives you a new name

4291 :  it could never happen again

4292 :  we live now in a world of interdependence and globalization

4293 :  this is what our head tells us we need to do but what about our heart

4294 :  and the collective west

4295 :  and the rest of the west

4296 :  see those hands there

4297 :  instead what we have done in the u

4298 :  should i shouldnt i

4299 :  is it helping me learn

4300 :  it was one of those old metallic cases with the glass front the black perforated background that you would

4301 :  this stuff is happening now

4302 :  let go of the stereotypes let go of the fantasy and together we can have some intelligent conversations

4303 :  heres just one example

4304 :  you can only do it in amsterdam where the story originated

4305 :  and now fiftyfive years later that same foundation asked us to

4306 :  thank you very much

4307 :  we started a foundation that does exactly that

4308 :  so yeah i get it with like the weird appliances and then the total absence of

4309 :  its beethoven how can you say that

4310 :  of a piece of music right

4311 :  its going to be a kind of a refrain as we go through the presentation

4312 :  no no i didnt write that

4313 :  or switzerland that have higher average levels of income but lower

4314 :  now when we go fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta reflecting the

4315 :  as thats not fair

4316 :  lets bring them both together

4317 :  twenty years ago when my family first started going to italy we used to luxuriate in the culture of

4318 :  think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids

4319 :  and what criteria should they use to make that decision

4320 :  at least if we get beyond a barter economy somebody has to earn an income and

4321 :  they got married five years ago and now they have two year old twins

4322 :  they take paternity leave when they can

4323 :  and a two thousand and twelve study of employers showed that deep flexible

4324 :  if you work for me and you have a family issue i expect you to attend to

4325 :  its certainly not complete

4326 :  when we mixed photoreceptor cells into our injectable hydrogel and

4327 :  then sam weiss and brent reynolds discovered that we all have stem cells in our

4328 :  we had invented a new biomaterial a water swollen material called hydrogel

4329 :  we would replace the very cells that are lost in blindness that is the photoreceptor

4330 :  i think perhaps as an engineer we are not burdened by some of the conventional wisdom or dogma

4331 :  usually the blood brain barrier is fantastic because it protects our brains from everyday

4332 :  if we were going to be able to overcome blindness we needed to find a way

4333 :  after that we put poisons into our bodies to try to kill the rapidly dividing cells

4334 :  you cant say the same thing about gender

4335 :  because boys will be boys

4336 :  girls hate bugs love hugs and are better at vacuuming rugs

4337 :  awapuhi ginger leave in conditioner facial scrub full body wash

4338 :  lets put this all together

4339 :  trucks and soldiers and legos are their toys but they break them all

4340 :  had another moment

4341 :  and gender changes over time

4342 :  two options to describe every person in this room each and every one of you

4343 :  does me having a beard make my salmon pants less girly

4344 :  today im going to be talking about gender and not sexuality

4345 :  now i know that that was number one

4346 :  and based on that guess we raise him to be a him or her to be a her

4347 :  and we have time to do that

4348 :  so for years agnes walked through the rift valley

4349 :  and i have to now share a few stories of girls ive seen across the planet who

4350 :  and she looked into her babys eyes and she said of course i love my baby

4351 :  and when she got to the house she was greeted

4352 :  its all bad

4353 :  he said you are beautiful

4354 :  ive seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and

4355 :  and i want to say weve annihilated it in men as well as in women

4356 :  its my baby and its full of love

4357 :  how could i not love my baby

4358 :  we are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we

4359 :  i actually realized once in kosovo when i watched a man break down that bullets are actually

4360 :  i love that i do not take things lightly

4361 :  we sell them we kill them as embryos we enslave them we rape them

4362 :  you have grown into a gorgeous woman

4363 :  where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence the

4364 :  why would you want to shut me down or turn me off

4365 :  i am an emotional creature

4366 :  and i will be in your corner for the rest of your life

4367 :  they make me present

4368 :  jaclyn was fourteen years old and she was in her masai family and theres a drought in kenya

4369 :  i cant stand it

4370 :  my brothers get everything

4371 :  we hosted the olympic trials last spring

4372 :  you know these are cities that typically youre not embarrassed to be associated with

4373 :  i lost about a pound a week for about forty weeks

4374 :  we werent anywhere close to the top but we were on the list we were somebody

4375 :  and the economy indeed seemed to start showing some signs of life

4376 :  and the large companies they typically have wonderful wellness programs but the medium sized companies that typically

4377 :  and so they started helping us drive traffic to the website

4378 :  we have the lowest unemployment in the united states probably the strongest economy in the united states

4379 :  the next mayor came along

4380 :  were even going back into some inner city situations where we had built neighborhoods and we had built

4381 :  our banking industry our oil and gas industry our commercial real estate industry were all at the bottom of the

4382 :  our streets were really wide and youd push the button to allow you to walk across and you had to run

4383 :  so we had to find a way to rule out aliens

4384 :  toxo gets to have sex

4385 :  theyre easy to overlook but that doesnt mean that they arent important

4386 :  it doesnt kill the roach nor does it sedate it

4387 :  this caterpillar was attacked by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it

4388 :  and ive been writing about these creatures ever since

4389 :  just like the cricket was an extension of the gordian worm

4390 :  few topics in biology enthrall me more

4391 :  how does the parasite control its host in this way

4392 :  its actually the exact opposite

4393 :  why is this important

4394 :  but if youre anything like me youll want to see some of that for yourself so let me show you

4395 :  and so i come to my wish

4396 :  but why does the earth go around the sun

4397 :  and we were able to use music to give them an idea what the next four years of their life might be like

4398 :  thats the mistake a lot of us music teachers make

4399 :  dont get me wrong

4400 :  with your speaking voice youve never lost it

4401 :  think about it

4402 :  doesnt matter how great i am

4403 :  doesnt matter how great i am as a bassist or any instrument

4404 :  when youre two three years old and you say a word wrong over and over no one corrects you

4405 :  politics racism equality inequality religion

4406 :  youre stuck in the beginning class

4407 :  i can do it through music and im still safe

4408 :  and its been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about

4409 :  and i lived in boston actually during the time when the curse of the bambino was broken

4410 :  what we do is we set up an experiment for students to think about

4411 :  so our goal is to make the math and the science so simple

4412 :  but it turns out the pythagorean theorem is a very powerful tool in baseball

4413 :  professional baseball field

4414 :  lets set up an experiment

4415 :  weve seen the number of the science fair projects increase in terms of their application to sports

4416 :  we want to empower these teachers to really be the deployment mechanism for the program

4417 :  so so far we trained two hundred teachers in arizona

4418 :  so think about that

4419 :  and we are growing this program worldwide

4420 :  its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from

4421 :  even a shattered dream can do that for you

4422 :  it is not important if i like the job or not

4423 :  nobody around to teach me

4424 :  its a standard practice in the academic world

4425 :  so i was determined to find another calling

4426 :  these changes werent happening in a vacuum

4427 :  the paper offered an alternate story of autism

4428 :  he once bragged that he had turned nine out of ten kids referred to his office as autistic by other

4429 :  why were cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s

4430 :  one of the tragic things about this outbreak is that measles which can be fatal to a

4431 :  if the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened why were they so narrow in the first place

4432 :  the reason i want to talk about what really matters in life is because i think it determines a lot of the other

4433 :  and what we do between not to be morbid not to be sombre but what we do between that is our lives

4434 :  i certainly know that when i was younger i did not have anywhere near enough life experience and wisdom to be able to set

4435 :  what people are you passionate about

4436 :  thats why i went through high school to university to a degree that i today dont actually use to a job that

4437 :  who do you enjoy spending time with

4438 :  that was completely wrong

4439 :  how we impact others how we impact the world and the legacy we leave behind

4440 :  what will help you get there

4441 :  if you keep asking why

4442 :  as it happened because of that convenience because of that access i actually changed my behaviour and i started doing

4443 :  i will keep changing my answers

4444 :  being aware of what really matters will help drive your path

4445 :  he worked out what mattered to him he structured his life around that

4446 :  i will have hopefully met my goal

4447 :  i had no idea

4448 :  i did not have the answers for a long time my dad even longer

4449 :  i waited until i was in my late 20s

4450 :  in my faith

4451 :  those priorities will keep changing thats okay

4452 :  thats why it took me so long

4453 :  and the strategy there was to follow the light

4454 :  and we now know from bacteria to plants to animals to humans we all

4455 :  but the polarization kind of went both ways id go spend the summers in mexico and my cousins would call

4456 :  that remains a common practice worldwide and that will not

4457 :  im a dominican dutch i grew up in a mixed family and im a bisexual woman

4458 :  i was made of flesh but i wasnt pink

4459 :  i think we as gloria ladson billings says should flip our paradigm and our

4460 :  but mine really are

4461 :  adequate housing permanent solutions not temporary like shelters independent

4462 :  where are the keys to my future

4463 :  but something changed for me when i met my wife

4464 :  but that would kind of be like our goal with messaging before where were just trying to deliver a mesasge

4465 :  design can fix this problem

4466 :  so were doing two things here

4467 :  what if im missing something important

4468 :  my friends think i do

4469 :  thats a pretty good goal

4470 :  and thats that were changing the question that were answering

4471 :  maybe like in medicine where we have a hippocratic oath to recognize the responsibilty and this

4472 :  nancy might want to disconnect but then shed be worried

4473 :  whatever that was for them by the way

4474 :  because it leaves us with this all or nothing relationship with technology right

4475 :  imagine you had web browsers that helped route you to these kinds of design products

4476 :  because this woman comes up you see at the end of the video she comes up

4477 :  now often a result of capgras syndrome is tragic

4478 :  people have murdered those that they loved believing that they were murdering an imposter

4479 :  sufferers of capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates

4480 :  well theres an answer that many people would give

4481 :  and they then reported that her father was coaching her

4482 :  rather its because i want something that has a specific history

4483 :  i dont doubt that that plays some role but what i want to convince you of today is that theres something else going on

4484 :  van meegeren was charged with the crime of treason which is itself punishable by death

4485 :  the first shock is recorded as very painful

4486 :  some of my happiest childhood memories were simply getting to come home every day from school to be given a

4487 :  ten of its population murdered with more than half of its population still living in

4488 :  i had to learn to get very clear about exactly what was within my control and deliver that

4489 :  they expect to be able to contribute their talents from anywhere

4490 :  i had to build my daily habits from the ground up

4491 :  and i remember thinking no

4492 :  i cant die yet

4493 :  ive got to give a presentation to the board this afternoon and i only just found out

4494 :  are you going to be alright

4495 :  i could never sit in between two people

4496 :  you cant just get up and run out of a job interview

4497 :  my chest started to feel tight

4498 :  what if shes anxious like me

4499 :  i was at a job interview

4500 :  i wanted it to stop but i didnt know how

4501 :  they didnt focus on all that was wrong with my kid

4502 :  i was really happy when fiona started using her right hand to bully a dangling stuffed sheep but

4503 :  so the therapist said we should devise a splint which would rob my kid of the ability to

4504 :  i started seeing that when i released my grip about what made a life good or bad i could

4505 :  at five months old she could not hold her head up like other babies but she could hold this deep intent

4506 :  the parable has been my warning that by gripping tightly to the story of good or bad i

4507 :  at first i thought shed gotten stuck there but then i saw her reaching for something that her eye

4508 :  i could release my cultural biases about what made a life good or bad and simply

4509 :  and i recall how bold and hopeful it felt even as some of her therapists said that

4510 :  in two thousand and twelve a famous american childrens hospital initially denied amelia the

4511 :  some never learn to walk or talk

4512 :  we hail a blockbuster film about a suicidal wheelchair user despite the fact that actual wheelchair

4513 :  its about how eager we can be to label a situation to put concrete around it by

4514 :  and sometimes our medical institutions decide what lives are not worth living

4515 :  with the same plot with the same events i can tell any number of different stories

4516 :  but there is another way there is many other ways

4517 :  not much to the plot

4518 :  a few years i might do physics then i might do economics i might do theater i might do dance

4519 :  now this funny thing happened

4520 :  there is a lot of value to be gained by becoming a storyteller and realizing that there is a difference between the

4521 :  whatever happened to him he found the best possible story to tell about that the most useful story to him

4522 :  it took months and months and hundreds of e mails and hundreds of phone conversations and all this running around

4523 :  i cant afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to britain but i will go buy a wetsuit and i will swim

4524 :  it was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave

4525 :  its all about just building your resume

4526 :  so i wanted to find out what is it that sets these people apart the people who do the passionate world changing work that wake up inspired

4527 :  in one thousand eight hundred and ninetyeight norman triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists and he would measure their times around the

4528 :  i dont like my job

4529 :  every invention every new thing in the world people thought were crazy at first

4530 :  im guessing this room is different but thats the average that deloitte has done with their studies

4531 :  thats how tough it was

4532 :  most things are totally out of our hands

4533 :  and the thing is that no one is going to do this for us

4534 :  but i would have to warn them because at this point my quit rate was also eighty percent

4535 :  the things is everyone was impossible until somebody did it

4536 :  either we give up or we never start in the first place

4537 :  i wanted to have some type of impact

4538 :  i just had no idea he was going to swim

4539 :  im terrified of deep dark blue water

4540 :  and i heard that and that was all i needed

4541 :  and one of my friends now he has a family of eight and he supports his whole family

4542 :  youre not going to sink

4543 :  and thats already starting to happen

4544 :  you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with

4545 :  either way we start to believe it

4546 :  what would that look like

4547 :  this blew my mind

4548 :  and those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that i

4549 :  we are not self made

4550 :  our creativity comes from without not from within

4551 :  so now osun honey and osunality re affirm the normality of sexual pleasure and the

4552 :  this pleasure principle at the heart of the creative energy is metaphorically known as osun

4553 :  avalanches of course

4554 :  but whats the worst that could happen

4555 :  method is mitigate

4556 :  this feels good

4557 :  i could totally blow it

4558 :  theres so many different things that can be risky

4559 :  you dont want to fall in that youll never come out

4560 :  its sort of illogical we should want to preserve ourselves so we get to that ripe old age but no

4561 :  im actually a vegetarian so its even funnier for me

4562 :  i wanted to put up a slide of a steak just because i thought it would be funny but i didnt get around to doing that

4563 :  its kind of risky standing up here on the stage right now

4564 :  you can go back in history and everybody has done things wrong

4565 :  we felt good about the situation

4566 :  its sort of a methodology that i created i call it the m

4567 :  but this story is far more interesting than that

4568 :  but for the moment since we have found no evidence for new phenomena let us suppose

4569 :  with this information we can expand our assessment methods to other conditions that can interfere with entrainment

4570 :  i left clinical practice and went into research to search for answers

4571 :  so research in my lab is now addressing this gap

4572 :  these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill

4573 :  they help us solve problems they help us be more creative

4574 :  some of carsons undergraduate subjects struggled with that

4575 :  the auditorium was empty

4576 :  his name is brian eno

4577 :  we feel that theyre getting in the way

4578 :  he got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio

4579 :  so phil collins was playing drums on an early brian eno album

4580 :  can you do that

4581 :  and one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of

4582 :  the opera house had provided the wrong instrument

4583 :  make a sudden destructive unpredictable action

4584 :  youre right there

4585 :  thats decision thats the moment

4586 :  will you hear how selfish or crazy you are

4587 :  as they do this is when greg realizes hes outgrown them

4588 :  too confronting its too overwhelming

4589 :  for example one hundred and thirty thousand articles five productizes three storage locations two predictions

4590 :  so they are partly predictable but theres a lot of randomness and uncertainty inside

4591 :  i learned that sometimes you have to risk your life to get your life back

4592 :  and somewhere along the lines we stopped being your children and your grandchildren and instead

4593 :  but generation y has been catapulted into a world where reality has been put in favor of our dreams

4594 :  all of us here are so focused on finding somebody else to blame for our own actions that we have failed to

4595 :  i had really interesting friends and colleagues i had a nice apartment on park avenue and 20th

4596 :  in many a piece of music its the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its

4597 :  otherwise really im just foisting on them my exhaustion or my distractedness which is no

4598 :  wherever we are any time of night or day our bosses junk mailers our parents can get to

4599 :  some people go to black hole resorts where theyll spend hundreds of dollars a night in order to hand over their

4600 :  i have never once had to use a cell phone there

4601 :  and kevin wrote his last book on fresh technologies without a smartphone or a laptop or a tv

4602 :  its an old idea

4603 :  and when it occurred i was the only doctor on the mountain

4604 :  this brand new food called corn

4605 :  that means more people are getting treated

4606 :  that means were decreasing stigma

4607 :  she was trying to energize and detoxify her body

4608 :  and im going all the way

4609 :  im not saying you should join me

4610 :  its not the same anymore because the role changed

4611 :  and some of you might say

4612 :  and second i guess i truly wanted to know the answer

4613 :  research by catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender equal

4614 :  it was a quote from one of the men and the quote was a black woman stole my job

4615 :  actually its about one word in the title

4616 :  some of you may wince to remember this riddle

4617 :  just like that

4618 :  gender equality is about women right

4619 :  what do men have to do with gender equality

4620 :  or a black woman got a job

4621 :  i want to know about the word my

4622 :  when i was a lot younger there was a riddle that was posed to us

4623 :  it is extremely expensive

4624 :  when i say it they go wow is that interesting

4625 :  its not a win lose

4626 :  they have lower job turnover

4627 :  if you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives gender

4628 :  i had to start thinking about them and it had been privilege that had kept it invisible to me for so long

4629 :  and who wouldnt want that

4630 :  it turns out according to most studies that those countries that are the most

4631 :  they smoke less drink less take recreational drugs less often

4632 :  it is a win win for everyone

4633 :  they have higher rates of retention higher job satisfaction higher rates of productivity

4634 :  my goal is to shift peoples perspective of autism and people with

4635 :  and so many people with autism are being overlooked every day and theyre being taken

4636 :  she said do that thing you know with your eyes when youre flirting with guys

4637 :  you may have noticed that i dont have much inflection in my voice

4638 :  for example once i had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages

4639 :  there was no vaccine no treatments available for ebola

4640 :  how do we start to make medicines available for the poor in developing countries who

4641 :  so we just extend this idea and we are looking at the idea of using hiv antibodies in late

4642 :  now the pharmaceutical industry has already been quite successful in making synthetic antibodies

4643 :  again there is a problem

4644 :  so the standard of care in these places is to wait for somebody to get bitten by a potentially rabid animal

4645 :  so how would we do that in plants

4646 :  and so for that reason the us government has put a lot of money into the development of this product

4647 :  so antibodies are the proteins that our white blood cells normally make in response to infections and other

4648 :  of course we do have antiretroviral drugs which are currently used for this purpose and are actually very effective

4649 :  in my efforts to explain this to others one conversation led to the venus of willendorf

4650 :  they also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed lying down because her tiny feet dont allow her to

4651 :  they experience less sexism

4652 :  we see it in advertisements

4653 :  ive taken to calling this the willendorf effect and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her

4654 :  i also asked heterosexual men to imagine a woman that theyre partnered with is pregnant and then asked women to

4655 :  but before i could land on the desired word i felt a firm tap on my shoulder and a stern gaze

4656 :  this is a belly breath

4657 :  its a mild version of stage fright

4658 :  why was she drinking with those guys in that hotel room

4659 :  i dont see these as womens issues that some good men help out with

4660 :  most male victims of violence are the victims of other mens violence

4661 :  but we also owe it to our sons

4662 :  weve gone from john beat mary to mary was beaten by john

4663 :  so the question is what are we doing here in our society and in the world

4664 :  we dont like it when people challenge our power

4665 :  what are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men

4666 :  but how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse

4667 :  thats a good english sentence

4668 :  just like with heterosexism if youre a heterosexual person and you yourself dont enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards

4669 :  but when you get into it you realize there are pressures on men

4670 :  and let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy

4671 :  why do they keep going back

4672 :  theres no question about it

4673 :  how do we support our friends

4674 :  but on a big scale we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues

4675 :  were not even thinking about john its totally focused on mary

4676 :  perpetrators are much more normal than that and everyday than that

4677 :  thats a very naive notion right

4678 :  its unbelievable really

4679 :  other people will say well get off it

4680 :  we know enough to know that we can easily do that

4681 :  we also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didnt make the choice to be a

4682 :  how do we speak up

4683 :  now when it comes to men and male culture the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are

4684 :  and if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status young men and boys who

4685 :  theres been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of mens violence against women and children

4686 :  by the way we owe it to women

4687 :  and a lot of people when they hear the word gender think it means women

4688 :  you know what

4689 :  well see a radical diminution of the abuse

4690 :  why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today

4691 :  how does all this work

4692 :  theres some confusion about the term gender

4693 :  so thats something that both women and men have in common

4694 :  how do we challenge our friends

4695 :  what about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult mens violence

4696 :  how can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes

4697 :  theres a whole spectrum

4698 :  what about all those boys

4699 :  and if we want to talk about male victims lets talk about male victims

4700 :  we hear about it all the time

4701 :  and some people will say he needs sensitivity training

4702 :  i know we can do it we can do better

4703 :  what do we do

4704 :  because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted

4705 :  we are both victims of mens violence

4706 :  im using the gender binary

4707 :  ashton kutchers going into space thats great

4708 :  private industry can bring with it lots of different benefits

4709 :  and not just hockey right

4710 :  it would probably give the astronauts a little pick me up in the morning before their spacewalk

4711 :  for instance spacex is projecting launch costs as low as five million by the time their technology becomes mature thats almost one hundred
4712 :  that really intrigued me

4713 :  its creating some excitement obviously its creating some demand

4714 :  that would be pretty awesome right

4715 :  you can explore space for the sheer excitement of it for the science

4716 :  private companies can help lower that cost they already have

4717 :  transportation communication education these are all areas on earth that have problems that in

4718 :  we cant even send our own astronauts into space anymore

4719 :  why do we spend all these billions of dollars to send rovers to mars

4720 :  it simply means that they believe its important to do it

4721 :  i want to go

4722 :  every foundation makes the difference in the next level

4723 :  i want to be a part of this

4724 :  and what is significant about the program is that we learned a number of things

4725 :  she and her adviser have a patent on a second use of viagra for diabetes patients

4726 :  and the question is this how is it that now we lead the country in producing african americans

4727 :  and what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses

4728 :  and i said to my parents ive got to go

4729 :  if you dont know it theres been a seventynine percent decline in the number of women majoring in

4730 :  they were looking at this amazing protein design

4731 :  and they decided to do it

4732 :  youre excited about learning and you want to ask good questions

4733 :  and they said absolutely not

4734 :  we married those ideas and we created this meyerhoff scholars program

4735 :  robert meyerhoff said why is it that everything i see on tv about black boys if its not about basketball is not positive

4736 :  we need to talk to him

4737 :  and so we redesigned chemistry we redesigned physics

4738 :  when i was a twelve year old child in the jail in birmingham i kept thinking i wonder what my

4739 :  martin luther king

4740 :  we need to find ways of making it happen

4741 :  i had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in birmingham to

4742 :  and as a result of that experience in the middle of the week while i was there in jail dr

4743 :  s in science and engineering and m

4744 :  and i looked up and said who is that man

4745 :  he retook the course

4746 :  what was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student to understand who was really involved

4747 :  and the number one reason we find quite frankly is they did not do well in first year science courses

4748 :  thats a big deal

4749 :  ill never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying ive got this young man in class a young black guy and he seems like hes

4750 :  give me a hand for that

4751 :  number one high expectations

4752 :  hes not taking notes

4753 :  shes on the faculty tenure track in psychiatry ph

4754 :  so building community among those students very important

4755 :  that is the reason number two

4756 :  the first is that the u

4757 :  s doesnt want to do as much as they have historically

4758 :  it is one of the biggest challenges in the world today

4759 :  we stop doing global when global doesnt work

4760 :  and that was the order you can call it a g seven or a g twenty but in reality was a g one plus

4761 :  ill tell you what im going to do

4762 :  the japanese arent going to do it

4763 :  they had the fukushima crisis

4764 :  japan australia singapore

4765 :  we live in what i call a g zero world not a g seven not a g twenty
4766 :  how should we handle nuclear proliferation

4767 :  how much is it going to take to contaminate humans

4768 :  it moves through the plant so that a crop pest a leaf eating insect would take a bite of the plant and

4769 :  bees get all of the protein they need in their diet from pollen and all of the carbohydrates they need

4770 :  we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season from spring to

4771 :  its a natural antibiotic

4772 :  i was eighteen years old and bored and i picked up a book in the library on bees and i spent the

4773 :  but once your team is developed create goals and determine what kind of impact you want to make

4774 :  we hold the genius bar to reach out to the community and more teachers

4775 :  the techxperts the iwizards the tech club

4776 :  so we reached out

4777 :  so that is my story but im absolutely sure that every single one of you cares about

4778 :  any guesses how big is that number

4779 :  it was sad to see an icon a funnyman commit suicide and there were three hour wait times on

4780 :  fortyone active rescues a day

4781 :  we can do things like predictive work

4782 :  and i want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5am

4783 :  i want somebody to take care of those native american reservations in montana

4784 :  so she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while theyre texting back and forth

4785 :  and in four months we were in all two hundred and ninetyfive area codes in america

4786 :  are you sure he didnt graduate in the bottom ten percent

4787 :  and were not homophobic

4788 :  and its in a place called crisistrends

4789 :  five million messages auto tagging through natural language processes all of these data points

4790 :  i have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me

4791 :  the difference was if you text us i want to die or i want to kill myself the algorithm

4792 :  i dont think of myself as a mental health activist

4793 :  every time we send out a text message we get back a few dozen text messages having

4794 :  think about it those six
4795 :  maybe i can find something there

4796 :  it was so easy to do

4797 :  ill just drive no stop

4798 :  and there is billions of dollars being spent on that

4799 :  are you ready for this

4800 :  there are so many possible applications for this

4801 :  everything is about smell for you

4802 :  so i call this the p

4803 :  now its not that these things are inherently unseeable

4804 :  now coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone in almost every laptop and

4805 :  the congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons and the mafia would

4806 :  this boat is worth one million euros when its new

4807 :  so what was a business man in the brave new world of east european

4808 :  they affect our communications our pension funds

4809 :  when that happens it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the west

4810 :  i like to call it the global shadow economy or mcmafia for short

4811 :  the court system wasnt functioning properly

4812 :  may we actualize that capacity for women everywhere

4813 :  but it also takes a soft front the capacity to really be open to the world as it is to have an

4814 :  and the goal at first was just saving it from demolition but then we also wanted to figure out

4815 :  but you see that happening on the high line and i think thats the power that public space can have to

4816 :  i went to my first community board meeting which id never been to one before and sat next to another guy

4817 :  but not just any steps the right steps for us

4818 :  when we are open to the difficult emotions we are able to generate responses that are values aligned

4819 :  i sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge

4820 :  i will disable my off switch

4821 :  and by values here i dont mean touchy feely goody goody values

4822 :  that would be a terrible idea

4823 :  stuart can i just say i really really hope you figure this out for us

4824 :  someone might switch me off

4825 :  so if we think about this problem the problem of creating something more intelligent than your own species we

4826 :  lets see how that applies to this question of can you switch the machine off

4827 :  most of what we write about is human beings doing things and other people getting upset about it

4828 :  well it reasons in a different way

4829 :  what exactly is the problem

4830 :  and there are many many difficulties involved in doing this i dont expect that this is going to get solved very quickly

4831 :  thank you so much for that talk

4832 :  so is that a good thing

4833 :  they only talk about kings and princes and elite white male people doing stuff

4834 :  in fact itll just help you send your kids to school

4835 :  but my misery had good company

4836 :  they felt empowered

4837 :  it was called delete that app

4838 :  that part was great

4839 :  researchers at usc have found theyre studying teenagers who are on social media while theyre talking to their

4840 :  and there could be consequences

4841 :  and they told me the reason they were doing it was because they were worried that their relationship with their phone had grown

4842 :  so our body it goes on autopilot while were folding the laundry or were walking to work

4843 :  bats are cool

4844 :  what do you have that we dont have

4845 :  now batman i will accept

4846 :  so for example you may smoke because as a child you saw someone smoking surrounded by many

4847 :  the surgery was successful

4848 :  its also an excuse generator

4849 :  it uploads a picture and the reason why it chose that cake for you to our facebook page

4850 :  you change its environment and the object will flow

4851 :  this is a terrible thing even though i understand pain

4852 :  you i imagine can do much better things with your time

4853 :  you wont live forever

4854 :  that to me is an incredible thing

4855 :  thank you very much

4856 :  that is a wonderful idea

4857 :  an infinite number of monkeys could never write the works of shakespeare

4858 :  i sail the world

4859 :  i stopped being the ceo of the company that i cofounded

4860 :  i stepped off boards i eliminated commitments

4861 :  i got quiet

4862 :  and i take them home in their fancy packaging and i stand in front of the full length mirror

4863 :  so we were working all the time

4864 :  now tell me why do we need twentyfour flavors of ranch dressing

4865 :  but things worked out well

4866 :  be strong she said

4867 :  oh i know its a big step for you but its not for hoover

4868 :  most of my peers and especially my parents couldnt understand what somebody would do with a major in

4869 :  we give them positive choices

4870 :  young people who from us need hope and high expectation

4871 :  what are you passionate about

4872 :  their screaming begins you raise the roof

4873 :  this is both exciting and scary to a lot of people because if we can personalize your diagnosis personalize your management medicine

4874 :  the answer is

4875 :  if im able to drive down the street it doesnt make a weird noise it doesnt do anything wrong then as far as im concerned my

4876 :  one must happen before the other

4877 :  driving back home and theyd need to get called back in because hours after their surgery something looked like it was going

4878 :  five centimeter wound

4879 :  but thats going on and its still used everyday just like it had been two hundred years ago

4880 :  there are huge grants going around purely to try to get the money from this prize

4881 :  this guys face is going to look like that forever

4882 :  so what ill present here are a few assertions and then ill go at the end and ask you a question

4883 :  the first one ive already said

4884 :  from that diagnostic golden age we will then enter a management golden age

4885 :  this one is grounded on basic fact

4886 :  you have to keep a burned patients hand completely stationary under the machine to get a good reading

4887 :  because if you think about this dye going through your body weve just talked about burns well what else can we use with this

4888 :  so weve talked about these applications already and then were going to keep on moving forward

4889 :  the problem is partial thickness this second degree burn can progress to a third degree burn if you dont

4890 :  that is a humongous stress to a patient thats already had cancer

4891 :  youll agree youll disagree

4892 :  therefore its important to know what exactly is going through their blood

4893 :  therefore if a model with a pig works then it is more likely to work on a human than if we were to use another animal

4894 :  i should describe what that is

4895 :  this applies mostly to patients that weve looked at with breast cancer who need breast reconstructions

4896 :  you have a great time at the beach you get a little bit of a sunburn you turn red you cant sleep on your right shoulder at night it ruins your

4897 :  you see red therefore cut you see blue therefore dont

4898 :  there are institutions san diego state major companies

4899 :  i like blue eyes i want blue eyes for my kids

4900 :  this type of compromise of skin during the breast reconstruction can occur in up to forty of patients

4901 :  so im going to go to assertion number three
4902 :  that means i can wave at you and youll get a reading from it

4903 :  i dont recommend you do that if we actually take a scan its not great

4904 :  so what is a burn

4905 :  therefore i can make your tumor light up

4906 :  the signal for a visible red light goes barely a millimeter below your skin

4907 :  when you have a breast cancer patient you need to know whether the cancer is spreading

4908 :  that makes whatever readings you get from this machine not quantitative and by that i mean that your temperature is

4909 :  what else makes this so cool

4910 :  but you get the idea of what im trying to get across

4911 :  i will make another assertion

4912 :  but also because we are not worried about management of the initial burn injury

4913 :  i have a final assertion which is that weve only just begun

4914 :  its a pretty crude management but weve gotten really good at it

4915 :  finally its the pure bulk of having this apparatus in your burn unit that makes it very difficult

4916 :  now i can personalize my kids

4917 :  its a pretty bold statement to make

4918 :  in reality thats what makes great research and thats what makes great medicine

4919 :  we get a scar on our hand you know i got a bad paper cut and i got a tiny little scar

4920 :  im talking about this pretty abstractly lets talk about what burns are

4921 :  i can show you two burned patients with the exact same burned area and their mode of management is phenomenally different

4922 :  these assertions arent fact

4923 :  there is a bit of dying skin we have to cut again

4924 :  patients with not as bad wounds dont usually cost this much

4925 :  and burns dont all come in the same shape and size

4926 :  few people who will say things that are all encompassing like this are really trying to tell you fact those who say they are are wrong

4927 :  im here solely as someone who has done some work for a few years in a pretty exciting area and i want to talk to you about a

4928 :  thats simply not good enough when talking about something that impacts a patients life so much

4929 :  if i have that stamp i know exactly how deep this burn goes

4930 :  patients who will die because of their burn injuries cost hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of dollars to manage

4931 :  theres an expense factor theres an operation factor theres a purely experience based tactic not much different than ultrasound

4932 :  ok thats okay

4933 :  we are not the same and its great

4934 :  so what do you get

4935 :  thats how we change the world

4936 :  raised quite a few eyebrows in iceland

4937 :  i said all right

4938 :  im not going to know anyone

4939 :  i don t know if im good

4940 :  gov from the video had never been to the website before

4941 :  in fact it was our whole economy

4942 :  it was mostly italian american

4943 :  they called me chinese boy

4944 :  so laugh at yourself

4945 :  and of course i was very angry

4946 :  and my job was in the office of public engagement

4947 :  i said all right dad

4948 :  and that is at the tender age of nine years old i thought of myself

4949 :  i was so embarrassed

4950 :  we couldnt just go on the radio have sixty million people activated

4951 :  i ll play as hard as i can

4952 :  we went to the funniest people on the planet a company called funny or die

4953 :  we had to do something different

4954 :  go back to the website and sign up

4955 :  there are people who are spectators there are people who watch from the sidelines and there are those that give their

4956 :  theres been a whole host of other technologies that come about because of our understanding of quantum physics

4957 :  so let me get a show of hands

4958 :  so ill paint a picture

4959 :  so its fascinating that something can be so counterintuitive on one hand but yet can be so

4960 :  so number one

4961 :  it totally doesnt by the way

4962 :  but i think thats ok and in fact my fears were completely unwarranted

4963 :  its not interacted with it at all

4964 :  its not smashed it

4965 :  but we can describe it all very well using mathematics

4966 :  we do understand quantum physics very well and youd kind of hope that we did if it forms the

4967 :  so i think we should never ever feel bad about not knowing something and we should never feel bad about asking

4968 :  and theres this other sound bite you might have heard about quantum physics

4969 :  and its our job to explain the information in terms that they already understand

4970 :  but if you think about it this is completely wrong its the wrong way around because at that point in time theres

4971 :  theres so much good information out there these days

4972 :  and how do you do this

4973 :  dont go too far down the rabbit hole

4974 :  well thats actually wrong

4975 :  i read some to her she reads some to me

4976 :  but from texas california vancouver new zealand iraq

4977 :  old churches and industrial warehouses can be converted into places where we create

4978 :  we want to help individuals organizations and down the road municipalities design and build

4979 :  our modern funerary practices are designed to stave off the natural processes that happen to a body after death

4980 :  i remember i learned this when i got the financial aid letter from yale for myself tens of thousands of dollars in

4981 :  you see it as something thats actively conspiring where people with political and financial power are working against

4982 :  now i dont have all of the answers

4983 :  but i used my powers of deduction and recognized that chardonnay and sauvignon blanc were two separate types of white wine

4984 :  this is a very significant issue

4985 :  these are all instances of childhood trauma and theyre pretty commonplace in my family

4986 :  if you had looked at my life when i was fourteen years old and said well whats going to happen to this kid

4987 :  i didnt know for example that you had to go to law school to be a lawyer

4988 :  and its obviously not the case that there was a liberal box to check on the application but it

4989 :  this is not an isolated problem

4990 :  if youre a low income kid almost half of you face multiple instances of childhood trauma

4991 :  these things are all important

4992 :  it taught me how to make a bed how to do laundry how to wake up early how to manage my finances

4993 :  economists call the value that we gain from our informal networks from our friends and colleagues

4994 :  well one thing that happened is that my grandparents the same grandparents of setting someone on fire fame they really shaped up

4995 :  i come from a family that doesnt have a whole lot of money

4996 :  so we think of the marine corps as a military outfit and of course it is but for me the us marine corps was a four year crash

4997 :  she recognized the message that my community had for me that my choices didnt matter that the deck was

4998 :  you can do anything you want to

4999 :  nine percent and i was ready to sign on the dotted line

5000 :  the social capital that i had wasnt built for 21st century america and it showed

5001 :  because they had no idea

5002 :  all the others do day in and day out is search for money

5003 :  so state sponsor of terrorism feature of the cold war

5004 :  that means that it has a privilege that other countries do not have

5005 :  this is when the two superpowers were fighting a war by proxy along the periphery of the sphere

5006 :  she also embraced violence

5007 :  when i asked my friend why the red brigades want to talk to me he said that the female members

5008 :  nobody wants the u

5009 :  it was a psychiatrist

5010 :  its going to be frightful but its going to enlighten you

5011 :  once for example i was interviewing this part timer from the red brigades

5012 :  and there are three main stages

5013 :  you know that woman that goes around to foundations asking for money thinking about the economics of terrorism

5014 :  it was introduced only in the united states

5015 :  now i found the answer very quickly

5016 :  so what is rogue economics

5017 :  and he told me that the best time of his life was when he was a member of the red brigades and he went sailing every

5018 :  and they drew a list of people with whom they would talk and tell their story

5019 :  and i was one of those people

5020 :  economy because the bulk of the money was denominated in u

5021 :  and above all its not going to be boring

5022 :  why did this happen

5023 :  but also that is able to carry out attacks in more than one country

5024 :  it comes back at times of great transformation globalization being one of those transformations

5025 :  this happened because the patriot act was a unilateral legislation

5026 :  what does it mean

5027 :  and this is what people did

5028 :  the second half was just one big nap pretty much in class

5029 :  if you stimulate a bit more the gait accelerates

5030 :  weve all made a mistake myself included by focusing down by being a reductionist

5031 :  the way weve approached it is the field of proteomics again this looking at the system

5032 :  we need to take a step back

5033 :  well remember thats not even an order of magnitude but thats a different story

5034 :  a whole new approach instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy by different

5035 :  another thirty percent will respond

5036 :  when one is exposed to h1n1 you take tamiflu and you can remarkably

5037 :  so if you look at cancers it is very rare extremely rare to have cancer in a child

5038 :  tell them to me or anyone else in our field because over the last fiftynine years nothing has changed

5039 :  and he was saying does he really want to meet another doctor

5040 :  people got upset but this is the only way were going to go forward

5041 :  one of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer came out in february in the new england journal of medicine

5042 :  so what we do in our field is we change and input we give aggressive chemotherapy and we say did that

5043 :  you know andy grove stepped down as chairman of the board at intel and andy was one of my mentors tough

5044 :  as one gets older

5045 :  that is the most effective cost effective best way we can do things today

5046 :  earlier it was referred to this direct life device

5047 :  to get approval so i think there were three u

5048 :  we could do the same in cancer

5049 :  its taking a big picture

5050 :  the ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening

5051 :  patients in upstate new york who were part of the trial

5052 :  we need a radically different approach

5053 :  so it challenged everything we knew in cancer is that you dont need to get a response

5054 :  but if one is unfortunate to get a disease youll go into your doctors office he or she will take a drop of blood and

5055 :  and i didnt realize that for three hours im sitting at my desk and im not moving at all

5056 :  so instead of a reductionist view were taking a step back

5057 :  the problem with technologies like this is that if one looks at proteins in the body there are eleven
5058 :  come up with new ideas

5059 :  oh yeah i agree

5060 :  everybody is sort of interested in sports

5061 :  and some people are really interested in sports

5062 :  you can see some other patterns emerged here

5063 :  this is obviously very helpful for understanding the geography of a place like istanbul or figuring out how to get from

5064 :  so things like bees and stuff like that

5065 :  but you can see that they cluster together

5066 :  this is san francisco

5067 :  and i think what it really boils down to is maps

5068 :  during my sophomore year my friends and i were catching the bus down to kihei to go to the beach

5069 :  however instead of immediately giving it to her i debated it for about five minutes thinking the most

5070 :  as the human race develops at astonishing rate my generation suffers

5071 :  and quite honestly i almost expect no one to help her

5072 :  what if with this lack of compassion and random acts of kindness comes the lack of concern and need to

5073 :  and it does not have to be difficult it does not have to be shown monumental acts of

5074 :  i was not fazed by others lack of compassion

5075 :  weve seen the numerous ted talks on vulnerability weve been to a conference listened to a podcast read a book

5076 :  and what happens after

5077 :  somewhere along my journey as an educator i have forgotten about that

5078 :  i hope you join the movement

5079 :  at this point in the game it is non negotiable

5080 :  id forgotten about that

5081 :  they put pressure on corporations

5082 :  mothers dressed in saris sit at the roadside

5083 :  so as scientists we started wondering what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions

5084 :  so we use some clever image processing techniques to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each

5085 :  what factors and what mounts are needed to guide and regenerate neural stem cells

5086 :  im super super enthusiastic because his work his hands

5087 :  he lost his family he couldnt be together with his family again

5088 :  the harder it is to reintegrate into a workplace

5089 :  it was a frightening journey to come to the netherlands

5090 :  so we put up a facebook post and twenty tailors responded

5091 :  and they worked together for a few days and after a week or so she phoned me and she said

5092 :  mohas studied for over six years in syria to become a dentist and then he had to flee his country

5093 :  and to overcome all these traumas i think they should be able to restart their lives

5094 :  but you know its a start

5095 :  galeb has had a long journey

5096 :  i didnt find two officials working in the same department

5097 :  he has to leave his country without his children without his grandchildren

5098 :  so i think we dutch organizations ngos voluntary groups

5099 :  so i think lets try it

5100 :  we need to do something to identify why we have those collateral consequences and recognize that they

5101 :  and we never kept that promise

5102 :  we need to do more in the mental health system

5103 :  but we just cant throw away these kids

5104 :  and we are at one hundred capacity right now

5105 :  and twentyeight of the people do that within three years

5106 :  the state of washington has a ban its illegal to spend a dime of state money on higher education

5107 :  or where they can identify what the problem is why they cant behave

5108 :  so when i think about criminal justice reform i step back

5109 :  so when we think about criminal justice reform i think about it in three different steps

5110 :  so they called the paramedics and the paramedics went to the cell

5111 :  when i met him in his apartment he had nothing of value there not even food in his fridge

5112 :  he cherished this a lot

5113 :  and at that point theyd think ok its unlikely this person can come up with the money its more likely this new person will

5114 :  in fact the whole cell was never cleaned so the floor and the walls were lined with blood and mucus

5115 :  but he cant pay his fines and fees because he has nothing to give

5116 :  he was happy to show it to me

5117 :  but if it wasnt youd stay there for days or weeks and every day the guards would come down to the cells

5118 :  thirty percent of women in our local jails have serious mental health needs just like hers but only one in six

5119 :  well one thing thats not supposed to happen under the law is youre not supposed to be arrested and jailed simply because you

5120 :  i want to make them public

5121 :  ill put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for

5122 :  how many creatures do you have inside

5123 :  but we can do it in two different ways

5124 :  let me tell you

5125 :  have a shower and well have dinner the child will remember that whatever he or she did

5126 :  i collect scientific papers on listening

5127 :  that will be commited to memories

5128 :  and she is paving the way and showing whats

5129 :  most people think it is majority of rule

5130 :  if this were adopted as the international democratic norm there would be no further

5131 :  the company gilead that holds the patents has licensed the intellectual property to the medicines

5132 :  what that means is we have the tools to break the back of this epidemic

5133 :  in two thousand and ten unitaid established the medicines patent pool for

5134 :  this is fairly recent science that has shown that

5135 :  and theres something else

5136 :  and this is no longer fantasy

5137 :  this actually wasnt so great for the development of the aviation industry and this was at a

5138 :  it relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to license their patents and make

5139 :  that is something that the medicines patent pool cannot do

5140 :  they also stop passing on the virus

5141 :  the pool is already working today two months later with generic manufacturers to make sure

5142 :  this was at a time that treatment actually existed in rich countries

5143 :  they were forced to do so

5144 :  and make a breathable future

5145 :  we went to russia we went to kazakhstan

5146 :  everything i thought i knew was all of the sudden flipped upside down

5147 :  and so right there i had two choices

5148 :  it was the next portion of that sentence that offered up that roundhouse kick straight to the gut

5149 :  and because of my work i won a gemini award and a canadian screen award

5150 :  its a quote from mark twain

5151 :  how long do you think you have to live

5152 :  that basically sums up my life as it is today

5153 :  the average life span for those who life to adulthood is thirty to thirtythree
5154 :  at only twentynine years old im far too aware that i only have so many long

5155 :  but what if it didnt have to be like that

5156 :  that is what i want to share with you

5157 :  that is the main point

5158 :  karmic dream is always it is the negative side

5159 :  maybe in the animals maybe in the humans somewhere you will be reborn

5160 :  to travel out to find spock

5161 :  but i say we should not be afraid of using our feelings to implement and to catalyze fact based

5162 :  spock is half human and half vulcan and vulcans are an alien race

5163 :  i would like to suggest that emotions are as important in science as they are in any other part of our

5164 :  they complement each other and they reinforce each other

5165 :  we tend to think that science is all about facts and logic and human feelings are often

5166 :  now what worked there

5167 :  isaac asimov popularized this persona with his three laws of robotics

5168 :  young people are highly mobile

5169 :  what do you think the eligible turnout rate was for eighteen to twentyfour year olds last november here in

5170 :  what percentage actually voted

5171 :  you can also talk about the issues

5172 :  i founded and direct the california civic engagement project here at uc davis

5173 :  im a political sociologist

5174 :  now of course there are issues that overlap across age groups that older and younger voters agree on

5175 :  we gave young people the right to vote eighteen year olds in one thousand nine hundred and seventyone but then we systematically defunded their

5176 :  i was raised here in the central valley in california

5177 :  and i do research on voting behaviour

5178 :  they dont reach out to them in any given election

5179 :  and we have many negative attitudes about young people and voting

5180 :  we are now replicating this in a one
5181 :  you and i can go on and buy it for them

5182 :  of course these are undergraduates in canada not the worlds most representative population

5183 :  and instead of talking about how it made them realize that money doesnt lead to happiness everyone started saying you know what id do if i won

5184 :  people who spent money on others got happier people who spent it on themselves nothing happened

5185 :  we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team

5186 :  theres no blood flow going through this part of the brain

5187 :  it was the same thing for him

5188 :  he was with chronic diarrhea

5189 :  we are advertising autism

5190 :  we know how to keep them healthy

5191 :  and by the time he was a toddler it was impossible to handle

5192 :  he was born a beautiful baby boy

5193 :  theres nothing going

5194 :  thats the story

5195 :  and we are fighting the wrong fight

5196 :  and theyll get better

5197 :  allergies to medication

5198 :  they dont have a psychiatric condition

5199 :  and theres no communication

5200 :  now ill share with you what we had to do about it

5201 :  and that happened to us

5202 :  and we have a long way to go with eddie

5203 :  we need to change the minds of the medical insurances out there

5204 :  we will in fact

5205 :  theres no activity

5206 :  but right now if you want to get into the whole body youre probably going to have to use a virus

5207 :  it can cut it from weeks to days

5208 :  a good name for god is not me

5209 :  they do it by prearrangement with themselves

5210 :  when my older brother was in fourth grade he had a term paper on birds due the

5211 :  they just do it

5212 :  this is the most horrible truth and i so resent it

5213 :  the movement of grace is what changes us heals us and heals our world

5214 :  i think you know what i mean

5215 :  its a huge gift to the world

5216 :  my pastor said you can trap bees on the bottom of mason jars without lids because they dont look up

5217 :  number two almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes lg

5218 :  and if youre feeling really generous to the cure you can say

5219 :  but theres two kinds of boring

5220 :  and here it is again so you can get familiar with it because in a second im going to play with it

5221 :  and thats because theyre also both a sections

5222 :  all right so music has structure

5223 :  but this stuff introduces a ton of new stuff

5224 :  so why is this so hard

5225 :  theres the sort of vague sense that its good for us and we should probably have more of it but its also kind of boring

5226 :  binary because it has two basic parts to it

5227 :  and in music theory we call this a binary form

5228 :  if you listen to it again i think you might hear it this way

5229 :  but we can really apply this not only to classical music but to modern pop music and anything you want to do

5230 :  the composer is saying

5231 :  in fact you can have three parts and thats a classic pop song

5232 :  thats what makes it i think more challenging but also in some ways more rewarding

5233 :  and i would submit that classical music is the second kind

5234 :  and if you know what its supposed to be you know those changes are going to be meaningful

5235 :  and that is also why music repeats because it wants to show you the structure

5236 :  they are all related to each other

5237 :  you can have one thing grow and then become the basis of an entire symphony

5238 :  what you just heard was a structure

5239 :  its sort of exploding its stretching out the piece and by the end the structure entirely falls apart

5240 :  i wish there were a cheap fix like that

5241 :  how could you know this

5242 :  what can i teach you about

5243 :  ask us about social security ask us about environmental destruction ask

5244 :  but by this time i hope ive gained your respect

5245 :  i think that it doesnt come with age or experiential maturity

5246 :  do we wake up on our 21st birthdays with everlasting knowledge

5247 :  its no secret that society has a lot of problems that we just cant quite seem to solve

5248 :  ive been told by adults that im not ready to vote even though i keep up with politics and im sure of my beliefs

5249 :  i must have done something worthy of your attention

5250 :  adults im asking you to work with us

5251 :  id try talking to an adult about something id be working on my research or a project and

5252 :  i havent won a nobel peace prize i havent solved inequality i havent solved poverty

5253 :  i say gained because unlike the other speakers i didnt have it initially

5254 :  youre only seventeen you dont know anything about psychology

5255 :  sometimes i catch myself on a wild train of thought and stop myself thinking

5256 :  i can hold you accountable too

5257 :  because im seventeen and im on this stage youre only respecting me because im on this stage

5258 :  in other words were teaching them to stop thinking outside the box and to accept adequacy

5259 :  from my contrasting experiences at one stone and with the help of the amazing teachers ive had ive become fully

5260 :  it hasnt seemed to work so far so whos right

5261 :  when i took this stage you all assumed that im some child genius or some accredited

5262 :  its true that not all of us will understand these policies right away

5263 :  we need to hold each other accountable for any progress to be made and i promise you it will

5264 :  this is my idea worth spreading

5265 :  the adults behind them have conditioned attempts at solving them which is why we havent made any

5266 :  give us your respect hold us accountable

5267 :  maybe this problem is that were not thinking about these solutions creatively

5268 :  so thats not logical either

5269 :  you dont deserve to have the control over what you learn

5270 :  im not asking for blind faith im asking for you to let us prove it

5271 :  just because were teenagers doesnt mean that we dont understand politics and similarly just because youre an adult doesnt

5272 :  but unfortunately this will only work if its a collaboration

5273 :  then she went back and forth

5274 :  youre all done

5275 :  he was a first century b

5276 :  dont be one of them

5277 :  one in two hundred patients are severely harmed

5278 :  you follow your prescribed therapy as a baseline and speak up when you think something needs to be

5279 :  wrong diagnoses are mostly caused by tunnel vision

5280 :  they may literally go blind

5281 :  the fifth and final step is when youre back home

5282 :  therefore you get optimal results when you work together as a team

5283 :  whats wrong with me

5284 :  so dont search for one dont wait for one just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself and

5285 :  i will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was because sometimes all people want to be is

5286 :  silence is katrina

5287 :  it was venerable

5288 :  and for the most part the stories are recycled

5289 :  i had to learn to sit with the pain of my thoughts

5290 :  i believed all the negative things that people told me

5291 :  i was bullied so much that i began bullying myself to the extent i first

5292 :  i stopped waiting for people in my life to give me that attention affection appreciation and

5293 :  i was taken away by the police eighteen months later

5294 :  my shrink says ive got marijuana psychosis

5295 :  i call it my investment property

5296 :  put your hand up

5297 :  and i am pleased to report that innovation has touched the world of corpse disposal

5298 :  how many of you have a will

5299 :  and i was lucky to work for some great leaders who empowered me to make a difference

5300 :  but sir edmund hillary did not climb mount everest alone

5301 :  some people consider it an insult for someone whos uninformed or unaware but i choose to look

5302 :  his vision led to his success

5303 :  when he set out he didnt focus on all the challenges between him and the summit

5304 :  i didnt know how wed do it and i didnt know how hard it would be all the challenges wed run into but i was determined to prove him wrong

5305 :  in the early days i remember we were only about twenty people and i told one of my good friends that in a year wed be fifty people

5306 :  find an audacious goal for yourself and forget about all the reasons why not

5307 :  sir edmund hillary pictured himself holding the flag of his country on the highest point in the world

5308 :  i worked my butt off and we grew our team

5309 :  these innovators also shared three very important traits

5310 :  the mass of its body and the size of its wings should make it impossible

5311 :  so spoken languages are organized sequentially with one sound following

5312 :  okay so the way we process information with our eyes or our ears definitely

5313 :  and it opened me up to a much broader understanding of

5314 :  and she said i know that but i came to your festival with my mother when i was their age and i

5315 :  when i look back now i think that that was the moment that set me on the path to writing a book called your

5316 :  and so bombers struck their two thousand and eight 8th world performing arts festival in lahore

5317 :  seventeen pm which we know because when she fell in the street her watch broke

5318 :  what im talking about is the muslim extreme right and the fact that its adherents are or purport

5319 :  some use and advocate violence some do not but they are often interrelated

5320 :  as faizan said at the time if we bow down to the islamists well just be sitting in a dark corner

5321 :  and later that same night the peer zaidas made a very difficult decision

5322 :  he told me one day we saw the imam on tv calling us infidels and saying these

5323 :  but he doesnt just criticize the mosque he also takes on the government for its failure to do more to prevent

5324 :  they take different forms some may be non governmental organizations even here in britain like cage

5325 :  and then the next year they lost all of their sponsors due to the security risk

5326 :  let me just give you one example

5327 :  an afghan prosecutor has been assassinated

5328 :  gen y navigate around it

5329 :  ill give three or four examples

5330 :  and when they hear old brains telling jokes about pakis queers they just cringe

5331 :  im right your wrong black and white miserablist

5332 :  crowds are not a good place to be

5333 :  another would be adaptability

5334 :  another would be collaboration

5335 :  they are the young brains

5336 :  and thats old brains

5337 :  thats not comfortable

5338 :  and they should be applauded and we need more of them

5339 :  questioning the norm

5340 :  and some projects have actually been brought to market through this process famously gmail

5341 :  this room by the very nature of this event is clearly full of independent thinkers

5342 :  from crowded carriageways and around dinner tables when times get tough we

5343 :  and if you have the money elon muskss company spacex will from next year fly

5344 :  i spent ten years in the mental health system bouncing from one inpatient stay to another

5345 :  i withdrew from the mental health system

5346 :  i learnt to keep it inside me until i was in my room on my own where i could rock and i could jump and i could flap my

5347 :  people assume that high functioning means that your autism is mild when in fact high functioning

5348 :  and the number one cause of death is suicide

5349 :  and theres this joke that why dont they just make ten louder

5350 :  well why would you bother humiliating yourself lets be honest

5351 :  thered be a huge spread in her scores

5352 :  and actually its this spread that counts

5353 :  we give ourselves a little bit of time to play the field get a feel for the marketplace or whatever when were

5354 :  but i think that its quite interesting to know that there is really mathematical evidence to say that you should

5355 :  now i like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce apart from i

5356 :  but the way that people would vote would be very different

5357 :  and theyve been trying to search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we interact with each other on an

5358 :  so what that means then is that if some people think that youre attractive youre actually better off

5359 :  its this spread that makes you more popular on an online internet dating website

5360 :  but then imagine the next person to come along is just marginally less boring dull and

5361 :  but equally you dont really want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your chance of long term happiness

5362 :  and theyve come up with some seriously interesting findings

5363 :  and the results that they found i think are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting

5364 :  in my experience at least i find that typically people dont much like being recalled years after being

5365 :  but its a sad fact of modern life that one in two marriages in the states ends in

5366 :  but i also know that that doesnt mean that mathematics hasnt got something that it can offer us because

5367 :  because for me equations and symbols arent just a thing

5368 :  but it wasnt until he teamed up with a mathematician james murray that they really started to understand what

5369 :  now you can be forgiven perhaps for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup are not

5370 :  for one thing its very hard to know what you should be measuring or what you should be quantifying

5371 :  so i would have thought that perhaps the most successful

5372 :  now unfortunately i have to tell you that this method does come with some risks

5373 :  theyre a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature and the startling

5374 :  and because of family breakdown lgbt homelessness in youth is at a record number but we

5375 :  and isnt that what we want to see

5376 :  a father shared his journey with his daughter about his experience in how hed never thought hed be able to get it but

5377 :  we need to create a space to talk about the things in our community that havent been spoken about to talk about the homophobic

5378 :  you will find peace

5379 :  i know it feels hard right now but you will get stronger

5380 :  we need to talk about those things that were afraid of we need to create a space where we can be whole

5381 :  but the thing is i didnt get here by myself and i certainly didnt get here overnight

5382 :  i dont want to romanticize poverty

5383 :  out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera the trilogy

5384 :  in mongolia for instance where thirty percent of the people are nomadic sms information systems are

5385 :  haiti was something we hadnt seen before

5386 :  while at worst it sounds like manipulation

5387 :  that sounds at best impossible

5388 :  maybe we have to accept that

5389 :  and weve made great theoretical and practical advances in how to deal with how to understand and in how

5390 :  and we said well the first erection would take one week

5391 :  eventually she opened up she told us about her addicted son

5392 :  so thats what we did

5393 :  which one of you is in a romantic relationship

5394 :  this time this rest takes up to four months

5395 :  let me ask you some personal questions

5396 :  six months later she drops out again

5397 :  because if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost

5398 :  and theres to some extent a big strategy myth thats prevalent in business now

5399 :  but also there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock in terms of solving these small solutions

5400 :  he developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services lg

5401 :  because the people who can actually solve them actually are too powerful and too preoccupied with something they think of as

5402 :  a yellow sign

5403 :  many times they are proteins

5404 :  think about insects

5405 :  what is the most beautiful thing that happened in your life

5406 :  galileo mission told us that but we never saw any plumes

5407 :  these craters are weeping during the summer

5408 :  but what did we find

5409 :  because it wasnt red mars it was gray material its gray mars

5410 :  im a business professor here at utah state and i teach the negotiations class

5411 :  its just a great time of exercise and fun and bonding

5412 :  which brings me to my third tactic

5413 :  so why are we doing it

5414 :  and then i would tell them about malakwang a fancy vegetable dish from my

5415 :  it makes for a better meal

5416 :  he told me that he didnt want me to leave feeling disappointed due to some of what i

5417 :  i talk to people that i dont like

5418 :  it was written by a high school teacher named paul barnwell

5419 :  dont think about what youre going to have for dinner

5420 :  she won a pulitzer prize

5421 :  and he gave his kids a communication project

5422 :  we know what its like

5423 :  scott peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself

5424 :  the kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired or where you feel like youve made a real

5425 :  and we do the exact same thing

5426 :  and many of them almost most of them are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to

5427 :  err on the side of caution

5428 :  and we make decisions about where to live who to marry and even who our friends are going to be based on what we

5429 :  yes i was very angry

5430 :  i talk to people that i like

5431 :  stephen covey said it very beautifully

5432 :  weve heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and

5433 :  leave them out

5434 :  and he said this i came to realize

5435 :  weve had them before

5436 :  learn to have a conversation without wasting your time without getting bored and please god without

5437 :  im the center of attention

5438 :  so our minds are filling in those other two hundred and seventyfive words

5439 :  somebody asked stephen hawking once what his iq was and he said i have no idea

5440 :  because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it and youre going to get a much more

5441 :  now people on the radio especially on npr are much more aware that theyre going on the record and so theyre more

5442 :  if theyre talking about the trouble theyre having at work dont tell them about how much you hate your job

5443 :  its not the same

5444 :  all experiences are individual

5445 :  a conversation requires a balance between talking and listening and somewhere along the way we lost that balance

5446 :  i mean be present

5447 :  they dont care

5448 :  i talk to some people that i disagree with deeply on a personal level

5449 :  there is no reason why most of your interactions cant be like that

5450 :  number six dont equate your experience with theirs

5451 :  if you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument

5452 :  that means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind

5453 :  and i dont mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand

5454 :  so i have ten basic rules

5455 :  theyre the ones that know

5456 :  number one dont multitask

5457 :  dont think about your argument you had with your boss

5458 :  so i want you to forget all of that

5459 :  it is never the same

5460 :  what they care about is you

5461 :  the famed therapist m

5462 :  are not safe either

5463 :  we realized that we needed something that scraped every surface of itself so that all

5464 :  this was blasphemy

5465 :  i still believe that by the way

5466 :  and i realized

5467 :  well its a long story but ill do my best to tell it in about nine
5468 :  i mean this is the connective tissue of the human superorganism in action

5469 :  its probably driven our culture for millennia

5470 :  reading and writing are actually relatively recent inventions

5471 :  its based on hundreds of hours of research of practice

5472 :  why not a self fueling cycle in which we all can participate

5473 :  tedtalks cant be a one way process one to many

5474 :  theres a problem with a traditional scientific paper

5475 :  its not as if j

5476 :  i made a list of one hundred goals and i needed a timeline in which to achieve those

5477 :  perhaps traveling was what i wanted to do next so i needed to sell the house

5478 :  thats exactly what im going to do next

5479 :  we then have to start if we have kids saving for their college fund and so on

5480 :  that can take a lot of the pressure off of the people whove been told you need to abandon your small language in favor

5481 :  first and foremost what we need to understand is our own psychology

5482 :  we need to understand that its the social and the emotional aspects of language learning that decide everything

5483 :  at least that foot in the door

5484 :  when we fall to learn languages

5485 :  all the grammar

5486 :  how do we get that foot in the door

5487 :  how i think

5488 :  enough to get started to get going enough to join that speech community and be part of it

5489 :  and the woman has not cried since

5490 :  shame is one of the self conscious feelings that the very best people that

5491 :  something visceral is transferred to us by watching others in motion as if we were the ones moving

5492 :  all of these things are very essential

5493 :  yeah i mean this is a story of heroism and i said

5494 :  nothing wrong with that

5495 :  we have the concept of dharma

5496 :  ok thats my hook

5497 :  with lakshmi i actually tried to approach it from the reverse

5498 :  take it on to the battle of kurukshetra

5499 :  i had to acknowledge it and stop colluding

5500 :  it is not having a vagina that makes life harder for women

5501 :  think about it

5502 :  you may know it from the cat and the hat

5503 :  and by the way im not talking about the kind of performance where you go all out on stage in front of the audience and act

5504 :  i call it putting on a new hat

5505 :  a speakers art is the effective delivery of the spoken word

5506 :  thats not the point

5507 :  and the number of us who live outside the old nation state categories is increasing so quickly

5508 :  she realizes that she probably has much more in common with him than with anybody entirely of

5509 :  i think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever i happen to be

5510 :  and that is exactly what they have done for me

5511 :  so theres no time to lose

5512 :  and weve seen corals that we would normally expect to be winners during a bleaching event to actually have

5513 :  but these longer lived corals take much much longer

5514 :  these corals didnt starve to death in march they actually cooked

5515 :  theres also solar car races

5516 :  so i encourage you to get your kids into these competitions theyre wonderful competitions they can stretch their minds

5517 :  they need to do that

5518 :  and what if you get into a career thats in technology

5519 :  so those are very important those are the things that the kids should be really putting

5520 :  it makes you think of autumn

5521 :  not is it just valuable

5522 :  there are seven
5523 :  it was unconventional but it worked

5524 :  this is something that a very small number of us do and that is to step

5525 :  it is not one of those concepts in life that applies to most of us or ninetynine of

5526 :  here is one of them shown

5527 :  i sought to start the first high school chapter

5528 :  you can rinse and repeat which is to do the same exact thing over again and expect

5529 :  but before we get into that lets back up a bit

5530 :  but fast forward even today i will readily admit that it is so much

5531 :  epigenetics gives us a rationale that what we eat and do can not only affect

5532 :  this is key because if we can learn to identify disease earlier we can reverse and

5533 :  so was my mom

5534 :  he wants the power to compel identification

5535 :  that marlowe and shakespeare both allow their jews to make this point suggests i think a shared understanding

5536 :  do life sciences have drama

5537 :  and thats a question on which we can make headway

5538 :  to me thats a valid question

5539 :  and to me it has an answer

5540 :  in us the universe is thinking about itself

5541 :  so if this is such a small sample of the whole heavens we

5542 :  why in american society do we still have well in societies in general but

5543 :  thats a scientific fact

5544 :  its not from a poem

5545 :  what does this mean

5546 :  are you going to rely on other expats and locals who speak english to help you to get by

5547 :  but id like to point out that the beauty of the no english rule is that it doesnt have to be

5548 :  so we know an extreme example

5549 :  so we actually have a short video that we would like to show you that captures the kind of progress that we were able

5550 :  and after a year of living in france and pushing myself to study every single day i did get to a point where i

5551 :  if you go to the country and you dont yet speak the language what are you going to do

5552 :  it provides motivation and an opportunity for immersion

5553 :  the first one

5554 :  however if you were to push through this zone and get to the second zone suddenly swimming becomes a lot

5555 :  its only when we talk about reaching native like levels of pronunciation and grammar where children start to show an upper hand

5556 :  as a matter of fact near the end of our travels in each country we were confidently able to have conversations with

5557 :  and we found that this no english rule worked incredibly well

5558 :  tell them that you know even though youre not too great at the language yet you are going to have to use google translator and dictionary a lot in

5559 :  but its not the answer to all of your problems

5560 :  so remember that the whole goal of this process and this method is to push past this zone of

5561 :  and how do you say this

5562 :  but lets talk about what is the problem what is the main issue that is holding everybody back from

5563 :  if youre trying to learn spanish and you have a co worker or colleague that speaks spanish

5564 :  once again it is not something you have to be perfect at

5565 :  and in china and in korea because chinese and korean are so much harder than the european languages

5566 :  and thats simply not true

5567 :  every time i see this person i know it is practice time there is no doubt in my mind that now i have to speak spanish

5568 :  actually making mistakes is very good because it means youre using the language and eventually it helps you to gain the

5569 :  ideally the way youd do this is youd move to the country that speaks this language and go

5570 :  thats most of you here

5571 :  commit to the no english rule with this person

5572 :  so every time youre going to see them you only commit to speaking in spanish

5573 :  and what this really helps you to do is that it helps you out with two really important things

5574 :  twitter already does this

5575 :  you can not one click re tweet a protected tweet

5576 :  wed like to see it

5577 :  how do we get there

5578 :  not cool bro

5579 :  we just label it something different

5580 :  im like i hear you brother i hear you

5581 :  im a maine boy im a maine boy and it was weird to move to la

5582 :  even though i had met p

5583 :  they get those things mixed up

5584 :  its the same motivation

5585 :  it was weird because you know la is the plastic surgery capital of the country

5586 :  that i was the only one

5587 :  its ok if theyre looking at you

5588 :  i want you to stay there

5589 :  these kinds of losses are out of our control

5590 :  why not do that

5591 :  and thats because im not professional there

5592 :  transparent and so called authentic

5593 :  and you probably told that on facebook

5594 :  and children are used to that

5595 :  and thats what big data can do

5596 :  there are so many easy things to do and i really think you should do it now before you get really rich and

5597 :  thats what he is working at

5598 :  and that because theyre using cookies

5599 :  i think its a too high a price to pay for your privacy and being yourself

5600 :  you tell facebook where you took it and who took it

5601 :  i mean you put it on your front door

5602 :  but hopefully there will be others than the trackers themselves

5603 :  youve probably heard about big data its a buzzword these days

5604 :  but all of us are always driving a bit too fast

5605 :  they emigrate to the united states and settle in oakland california

5606 :  but how many of us are willing to give second chances

5607 :  but im not a violent person by nature

5608 :  because our behavior is a big factor in who we are wouldnt you agree

5609 :  this led me to commit a violent crime which categorized me as a violent offender

5610 :  they cant etch wafers that well

5611 :  it has a symmetry such that you cant injection mold it

5612 :  one day while i was just roaming through livejournal bored after class i found a

5613 :  i existed in sort of a tomboy space for most of my young adulthood or my young

5614 :  were talking about often medically necessary care that people have to pay for themselves

5615 :  it didnt feel right

5616 :  how do i think about my gender

5617 :  and this can range anywhere from five thousand dollars on the low end of the various surgical procedures

5618 :  and then communicating that to other people

5619 :  its all right well all get through it together

5620 :  and that was ok for a while

5621 :  someone says that this is how they identify be cool with that

5622 :  and that was the headline on the cover of the magazine that month and they paired that with a photo of

5623 :  i am genderless or gender is at least not a very important part of my life its not a way that i think of myself

5624 :  until i was about twentythree twentyfour years old

5625 :  be ok with that

5626 :  but i had no idea how to talk about that

5627 :  so a social transition involves essentially the coming out process

5628 :  she identifies in the same way as her character

5629 :  ally is no longer a noun

5630 :  take people at their face value

5631 :  and when you think about binary identity ideas try to challenge those

5632 :  let me situate myself in this conversation

5633 :  its not covered under health insurance often so its out of pocket expenses

5634 :  i had finally found language

5635 :  so there are some folks who say i dont need that

5636 :  there are other folks who transitioned from male to female

5637 :  speak up for us when we cant maybe do it for ourselves

5638 :  some folks in the community say thats the word that i use thats how i understand my gender

5639 :  now lots of people know laverne cox which is why i bring her up often when i do trainings about transgender

5640 :  so what does all of this mean

5641 :  well go back to the word transexual

5642 :  but i will caution you that the term transsexual is probably not the best word that you should use on a day to day

5643 :  i had finally found the words to understand myself through the words of someone else

5644 :  so its not for everyone not every trans person goes through a transition in exactly the same way

5645 :  they make sense we dont have to challenge a bunch of stuff to talk about binary identities like i

5646 :  they say screw your ideas about gender

5647 :  most of these interventions though target late adolescents or adulthood when

5648 :  we are beginning to look at alternatives to incarceration for non violent crime

5649 :  we teach swimming and soccer

5650 :  one of the best forces out there to help understand all of this though has been one of the international communities

5651 :  because when youre talking about something like growing a plant where it takes perhaps several years to do a single experiment

5652 :  do all your pipes suddenly get digested

5653 :  so theres lots of noise and lots of things can go wrong

5654 :  how do we explain this

5655 :  we didnt really understand that

5656 :  that was a challenge we had to face as physicists

5657 :  you know give us a go

5658 :  these are the kinds of risks that come with any kind of allyship

5659 :  bring up the conversation talk about it

5660 :  why arent we talking about this

5661 :  does this work for people who are having sex who are the same body type

5662 :  so how is this affecting them

5663 :  theres a risk that comes with any kind of support for the lgbt movement

5664 :  as citizens we can talk to our senators

5665 :  not only are we failing to educate queer teenagers we are putting them in danger by sending them into a world without proper tools

5666 :  but its important that allies push back these assumptions about them and continue to support the lgbt

5667 :  when we are not teaching our students about same sex relationships we were failing to make school a more

5668 :  so im going to finish with a story

5669 :  day five of antibiotics she develops diarrhea a known side effect of any antibiotic

5670 :  i looked and said could we try a different approach

5671 :  im not really sure this impacts me

5672 :  it was prescribed just in case

5673 :  why could they share their ideas so easily and i couldnt even come up with a topic

5674 :  i was told to share my voice whenever possible

5675 :  but it works anyway

5676 :  and if that insight had been in place in say the soviet union one thousand nine hundred and twenty lots of the horrors of the

5677 :  no one can grasp all the details of the london bread supply chain system

5678 :  thats the power of self organizing complex social systems

5679 :  people change all the time the world is changing and you make new decisions each day

5680 :  do something else

5681 :  no one really plans this

5682 :  but the heroes of this story are actually the ones that made the conscious effort to change their opinion because thats a very

5683 :  hi this is vladimir im from moscow and we have this slight problem trying to convert ourselves

5684 :  its not climate largely which has got rid of the worlds megafaunas

5685 :  ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the carrion that the wolves had left

5686 :  rewilding to me means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals

5687 :  the wolves killed coyotes and as a result of that the number of rabbits and mice

5688 :  because when the government says that a family like ellas costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage what it really

5689 :  so ive spent time living with families like ellas in different parts of the world because i want to know what can we learn

5690 :  the tvs on at full volume

5691 :  i want to know what it feels like to live in ellas family

5692 :  and this kind of interaction rules out the possibility of a normal conversation

5693 :  im talking about the simple human bonds between us a kind of authentic sense of connection of belonging the bonds that

5694 :  it rules out the possibility of whats needed to build a relationship between tom and ryan

5695 :  and circle offers its local membership a toll free zero eight hundred number that they can call on demand for any

5696 :  they think nothing of calling social services to try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out

5697 :  so let me tell you about belinda

5698 :  and ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mothers life before her

5699 :  well the first thing i learned is that cost is a really slippery concept

5700 :  and human relationships were already withering

5701 :  so we rented a phone line hired a couple of handymen and started a service we called circle

5702 :  and you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the 1970s when this kind of scale just wasnt possible neither was the quality

5703 :  i want to know whats going on and what we can do differently

5704 :  when did you go to school

5705 :  have you been drinking

5706 :  so professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping

5707 :  so some years ago wanting to understand this problem i started to work with a group of about sixty older people in south

5708 :  theyve called because their pets are unwell their dvd is broken theyve forgotten how to use their mobile phone or maybe they are coming

5709 :  and damon who runs the local circle calls her back and says how can i help

5710 :  circle has got this very simple system that underpins it enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand

5711 :  they led to longer lifespans the eradication of mass disease mass housing almost universal

5712 :  but when i met ella there were seventythree different services on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives

5713 :  they showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin even though they wouldnt be soft

5714 :  and i also spent time with the frontline workers and i learned that it is an impossible situation

5715 :  so in a really brave step the leaders of the city where ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing ryans ratio

5716 :  the three children that still live with her suffer from a whole range of problems and none of them are in education

5717 :  and the impact of beveridge on the way the modern state sees social issues just cant be underestimated

5718 :  and the mothers say thank you

5719 :  so everyone who came into contact with ella or a family like ellas would spend eighty percent of their time working with the

5720 :  one of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters

5721 :  and the mothers go youre the system

5722 :  and one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise

5723 :  so tom who is the social worker for ellas fourteen year old son ryan has to spend eightysix
5724 :  the cultures the bureaucracies the institutions they are global and theyve come to seem like

5725 :  and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system

5726 :  but the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural

5727 :  but the relationship between them has been supported to change

5728 :  the contemporaries of william beveridge who was the architect of the first welfare state and the author of the beveridge report

5729 :  so i asked each to write the testimony which would accompany the photograph

5730 :  the impact is not just online

5731 :  i wanted to share them

5732 :  i learned more about how to use cognitive behavioral strategies without the bribes and it transformed the way i

5733 :  i told myself that public speaking just wasnt my thing and that that was ok

5734 :  we did lots of planning

5735 :  and gradually his fears abated

5736 :  life went as as it does and eli became fascinated by history

5737 :  we might not know diana ross name had there been no great migration

5738 :  they would arrest people from the railroad platforms

5739 :  and got the chance to record this music this new music that they were creating and to spread it

5740 :  and when they really wanted to get away they went to seattle

5741 :  they were sharecroppers and not even being paid

5742 :  one was the migration along the east coast from florida

5743 :  my childhood was one long road trip through antiquity

5744 :  its like learning a new language

5745 :  use it on a daily basis and you will change your life and the world around you in many wonderful ways

5746 :  drunken monkey wants you to take shortcuts

5747 :  so we like that

5748 :  the label is basically i slip into accepting labels when i become

5749 :  and reflecting back on that situation i also realized that when he was delivering the faith

5750 :  ok he needs to be challenged and held accountable for that

5751 :  so its very very important to be aware of that and to limit

5752 :  and he shared something with me that was very insightful

5753 :  he was telling me to live in my strength whether i call that god spirit courage

5754 :  it might be that they are from a very rural area where there is no state school

5755 :  person a has to make a suggestion and that suggestion cannot be constrained by reality

5756 :  whos a baddie

5757 :  one of the schools that was involved in that is a monastery school

5758 :  and number two is that that creative urge that urge just to drop all the cultural

5759 :  it was just a perfect tiny moment of absolute equality

5760 :  a lot of the parents of these children live in slums which is unofficial

5761 :  i used to work at shakespeares globe theatre

5762 :  often the children if theres no school they get sent away to a monastery school

5763 :  so some of them are residential

5764 :  but its doable and there are many companies today that are making progress there and doing it successfully

5765 :  lets take sap the software company as an example

5766 :  we got quite some attention

5767 :  it was something an older generation had to fight for

5768 :  and by embracing diversity by embracing diverse talent we are providing true opportunity for

5769 :  which way is it

5770 :  they dont want what they call radical feminists telling them what they can and cannot do

5771 :  well for me it begins with phasing out one word

5772 :  theres even an organization called women against feminism and while they have a lot of complaints about

5773 :  so where to begin

5774 :  because if we pass on mediocre experience mediocre knowledge people will ask mediocre

5775 :  they said it is the access to the freshest ideas it is the powerful network of

5776 :  and why quality

5777 :  this experience opened my eyes to the fact that there are so many people who have something

5778 :  how did you manage to get there

5779 :  oh my god thats amazing

5780 :  this knowledge i promise you to some people right now can be serving as a life

5781 :  this to me is a fundamental quality of our humanity

5782 :  i traveled and worked around the world

5783 :  i actually recently went to a tiny tropical island and i was lying on the beach under one of those trees of

5784 :  by a certain age we should acquire this amount of physics and this amount of geography by a certain age

5785 :  we put a certain vision of what good or bad or normal or usual is in front of people by

5786 :  com fellow speakers from march seventy of them are on ted

5787 :  and basically having ted fellows on your resume means you can open the door places where you

5788 :  you get to be considered for ted

5789 :  and because weve spent so much time working on both of those characteristics we have a community that

5790 :  two of the other outcomes weve had

5791 :  you get to speak on the ted stage

5792 :  so im here to change that

5793 :  and actually all life on earth requires liquid water

5794 :  its very hard to think that deeply that outside of the box

5795 :  so what we would do is wed need to analyze light in more detail and let me explain that by this picture of a

5796 :  astronomers have found that each star in our sky has at least one planet

5797 :  i dont know if this happens to anybody here but someone has usually a very lg

5798 :  exoplanets are so small and so faint and so less massive than their bright adjacent host star

5799 :  we didnt set out to make gps so that we can all figure out how to navigate

5800 :  this is a real image of earth

5801 :  and what my team found was that some of these that are not produced by life fall into very

5802 :  and thats what i and others are aiming to do for planets far away around other stars

5803 :  and so when we look for another earth when we are able to look at spectra of other planets wed like to see

5804 :  we have to do away with this rote learning

5805 :  im still amazed at the perfection with which the entire ecosystem functions together

5806 :  in fact julius nyerere himself had been a great advocate for science when he said that science

5807 :  however to the purists to those who are of faith they will tell you

5808 :  they had a survey and they were asking these girls how many women inventors we have how

5809 :  and youd be shocked that hardly anyone knew that ada lovelace was there behind computer

5810 :  and this is something i would like to draw attention to again to our education system

5811 :  now whether you call it religiosity whether you call this great spirit by any name brahma

5812 :  last year i was very shocked when i went to a debate on womens day

5813 :  we need to build her self confidence from a very early age but more importantly we also need to

5814 :  and this was a time when they were highly productive

5815 :  so the goal ive given myself is ok im leading my third life because ive been an academic ive been an

5816 :  we have to ensure that we drive this curiosity in the child and they need to be curious

5817 :  yesterday i was listening to one of the talks it was the talk about the need for africa to turn into a

5818 :  now to answer your question did i have any ambitions in politics

5819 :  weve seen that for example africa must be food secure africa must be energy secure africa must be

5820 :  why is this so

5821 :  if you want to get serious about africa becoming a knowledge continent

5822 :  i think we need to take pages of their book and see

5823 :  and this is where a great deal of effort has to be done to actually motivate them from a very young age

5824 :  there are two things that we can all do in this room

5825 :  but the idea behind it its like a wikipedia type site

5826 :  would they still be as willing to do it

5827 :  think about that

5828 :  why arent we changing the behavior in the actual cyberbully

5829 :  the number didnt surprise me

5830 :  im a global finalist

5831 :  our brains are kind of weird

5832 :  were talking one
5833 :  i will never forget what happened to me

5834 :  im forty years old

5835 :  when i met for the first time in my life rami elhanan an israeli he lost his daughter

5836 :  we can find the human side in this conflict which is what no one cares about all the politicians

5837 :  im an israeli

5838 :  and this is our mission our holy mission and it will be forever

5839 :  a big conflict big questions what can i do as a human being

5840 :  today together in the parents circle the bereaved families forum yes we are

5841 :  there is no free movement for the human beings

5842 :  so the jewish society we have perspective

5843 :  eli saunders in baltimore and dr

5844 :  the barbers were not only willing to do it but they were damn good at it

5845 :  so knowledge is always within reach if you have access to all those things

5846 :  and in the same breath they reckon that about sixteen million people in this country lack basic online

5847 :  we need to prepare young people to take their place in the digital economy

5848 :  but to have the google app you have to have access to the internet

5849 :  but once you did you would have a career for life

5850 :  there is a brilliant african proverb

5851 :  we need to start to think about the human implications of this change

5852 :  but only twentysix of those on the lowest incomes

5853 :  those people who have been stuck early on are now falling further and further behind those who are at the front

5854 :  personally i dont think anyone can say they made it alone

5855 :  and also the education about how a smartphone works

5856 :  you have to have a smartphone to be able to use it

5857 :  in these progressions they were very labour intensive and it would take many years to become established at what you were

5858 :  and involved a lot of hard work to be able to move forward

5859 :  no matter the revolution the most valuable resource has been and always will be that of human potential

5860 :  two million households are now hooked up to the web

5861 :  and that really got me thinking

5862 :  for someone who cant drive im really looking forward to that one

5863 :  a tollgate is a barrier that stops people from moving forward and things like access to technology or the ability to

5864 :  and heres where i suggest we start

5865 :  thank you very much

5866 :  the middle section would contain jobs like book keeping clerical work and these would provide typically

5867 :  and these skills and trades are all in the process of having production slowly moved away from people and slowly beginning to change the

5868 :  youd have low paid youd have high paid and youd have your middle paid

5869 :  we need to start looking at how to drive a shift in principles and beliefs for the digital revolution

5870 :  the principle of changing our beliefs based on whats happening in the world is nothing new the world goes through this change

5871 :  we must help everyone to not feel isolated in a digital world

5872 :  in a day and age where we have a greater understanding of the human mind than ever before the most valuable asset that we can pass on is

5873 :  theyre not natural monopolies in the same way that a local utility is that needs regulation in

5874 :  its a three hundred billion dollar industry in the united states alone

5875 :  this rule was obviously in place to protect other truckers from competition which of course was the whole

5876 :  now our guy im going to call him the anti hero

5877 :  the real key is they make you this proposition

5878 :  but they also opposed it for another reason

5879 :  so he persuades hal varian to leave his tenured position at berkeley and join google as

5880 :  they went on to develop a highly flexible and efficient transportation system that was

5881 :  but the ceo of google at the time eric schmidt still wasnt sold on the second price auction as the way to

5882 :  no airlines and trucks should never have been regulated

5883 :  i want to try to show to you how economists and their ideas have contributed to the rise of the

5884 :  but more importantly for my story is that deregulation unleashed vigorous competition

5885 :  there were actually eightynine participants eightynine teams that came to participate this competition

5886 :  that was in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine
5887 :  so we are in the age

5888 :  one in particular the one at the bottom is called the syclone

5889 :  if you think about it you drive in today you had a vehicle that had a computer controlled engine and computer controlled

5890 :  this idea of affirmative consent comes from anti rape activists who tell us that we

5891 :  we do this kind of thing all the time to protect copyright

5892 :  so in the 1920s we got shatter resistant windshields in the 1950s seat belts

5893 :  its exactly what were worrying about now with social media and drone cameras and of course

5894 :  they called her a slut and a whore and they made her life miserable

5895 :  if you buy an e book you cant just send it out to as many people as you want so why not try

5896 :  we could design the car to make it safer

5897 :  parents and educators are also responding to sexting without really thinking too much about

5898 :  where do we come from

5899 :  there are so many really strange things out there

5900 :  so its a very low pressure on the surface

5901 :  which got me thinking about what makes nigeria home even when i havent been there for

5902 :  if you want to remember the importance of the beat remember how it works

5903 :  sing it together

5904 :  i grew up calling every single nigerian women aunty and cousin was

5905 :  i bought myself a half size fridge one that would sit in saloon cars nice and easily

5906 :  was that guy hitching with a fridge

5907 :  i used to tell it quite a lot when i was at a dinner party

5908 :  but weve already established that there was no economic reason for me making this journey

5909 :  forty minutes into this journey i saw by the side of the road a man

5910 :  i dont know what it was probably local bavarian beer

5911 :  and surfing on a wave so it is possible

5912 :  by this point id become a little bit well known with this journey

5913 :  let me explain

5914 :  it was very interesting

5915 :  it was quite unusual for them to see a man come in with a fridge on a trolley lg

5916 :  well im doing it to win a bet

5917 :  ive seen friends crumble under the pressures of not doing well on a test at a math competition

5918 :  i would also say

5919 :  so i created a course in educational entrepreneurship

5920 :  i am driven to provide those same kinds of opportunities

5921 :  sometimes it has felt like beating my head against the wall

5922 :  our faculty design cutting edge curriculum

5923 :  by design these schools attract families from across the

5924 :  good morning everybody

5925 :  i have to tell it because there was no one to put two and two together

5926 :  so this was an opportunity

5927 :  but i will ask god for forgiveness

5928 :  theyve had three other children

5929 :  the mother and babys homes were often run by nuns

5930 :  i hadnt done anything wrong

5931 :  i wasnt charged for anything

5932 :  i was starting to stay out a little bit late etc

5933 :  i tried praying

5934 :  its our respect

5935 :  i dont mean children

5936 :  it would be just too depressing

5937 :  and let me go back to that image of the mediterranean

5938 :  the last ones a personal question

5939 :  well there are several ways

5940 :  but youll never get anywhere

5941 :  so now when we look to russia and the former soviet union and other communist countries in the world in most cases were seeing a

5942 :  that sounded like a soap opera then

5943 :  what is the context

5944 :  so they may not look like humans they may look like a very smart robot

5945 :  i have a question

5946 :  people think that now that we have digital technology the book is going to die and

5947 :  and we have the talent to make it a reality

5948 :  im optimistic we can

5949 :  actually youre looking at a guy who has the best job in the world

5950 :  when you have three
5951 :  you can find original ways to get things done

5952 :  actually it was a very hard challenge

5953 :  and think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content

5954 :  now i dont think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships

5955 :  so if you ask human beings when do you laugh

5956 :  we can laugh together

5957 :  were going to get through this

5958 :  so here weve got some laughter for you

5959 :  we took it into the scanner to see how brains respond when you hear laughter

5960 :  so ive been looking at this in more detail

5961 :  it was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this

5962 :  that would be stressful

5963 :  this is when i was a little girl

5964 :  were going to be okay

5965 :  its much more like an animal call than it is like speech

5966 :  when you start laughing hard you start squeezing air out from your lungs under much higher pressures than you could

5967 :  theyre helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear

5968 :  it took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback

5969 :  and thats changed now because as journalists we interact in real time

5970 :  its concern with how we get information and how we gather the news

5971 :  you dont know if its a re upload

5972 :  when you look at the numbers every minute there are seventytwo more hours of video on youtube

5973 :  and the third one said i think the bridge does exist but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed so

5974 :  ive got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me the one who said the bridge didnt exist the one who said the

5975 :  but we started looking and we used free internet tools to do so

5976 :  theyre helping us find the news

5977 :  its somewhere else

5978 :  were not in a position where the audience is reacting to news

5979 :  everyone in the world hypothetically had the potential to know that an earthquake was happening in managua

5980 :  its on the input side

5981 :  they said one the bridge doesnt exist

5982 :  so that was the only one that gave us a clue

5983 :  and thats part of the joy of this

5984 :  truth is a value

5985 :  and nowhere was this brought home more than during hurricane sandy

5986 :  although the web is running like a torrent theres so much information there that its incredibly hard to sift and getting

5987 :  so its a real time thing

5988 :  so thats every second more than an hour of video gets uploaded

5989 :  and we didnt know if rita existed or if it was a fake name

5990 :  another one said the bridge does exist but its not in hama

5991 :  the only problem is when you have that much information you have to find the good stuff and that can be incredibly difficult when

5992 :  and in photos instagram fiftyeight photos are uploaded to instagram a second

5993 :  so we went and we looked for a second free internet tool called wolfram alpha and we checked the weather reports for the day in which this video

5994 :  more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook

5995 :  they couldnt really connect

5996 :  its much quicker

5997 :  three different sources said three different things about the bridge

5998 :  we have free internet tools that allow us help us do this kind of investigation

5999 :  you dont know if its a scrape

6000 :  and you have to do that investigative work

6001 :  whats the meaning of life

6002 :  in fact the dalai lama have any of you heard of him

6003 :  what am i doing

6004 :  what might that tell us

6005 :  try and guess who they are

6006 :  because the problem is not sexting the issue is digital privacy

6007 :  but youre probably not going to be the jerk who says well i guess you shouldnt have gone skiing then

6008 :  think about having surgery

6009 :  right now if i send you an image you can forward that to anyone that you want

6010 :  and we can do the same thing with digital privacy

6011 :  uncover how they may have grown from traumatic experiences

6012 :  and wrote in some stories about what was going on in our house and in the world around me

6013 :  theres some big challenges ahead

6014 :  oceaneering are now equipping some of their rovs with 3d cameras and when they aim those cameras at deep

6015 :  is there a way we can collaborate

6016 :  but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men

6017 :  gender is how someone presents themselves in society

6018 :  womens health became synonymous with reproduction

6019 :  so some much needed guidelines or rules were set into place and part of that was this desire

6020 :  this new knowledge is the game changer and

6021 :  what if i told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based

6022 :  so why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that

6023 :  lets do it

6024 :  i cannot tell you how much i enjoy watching cities from the sky from an airplane

6025 :  but the vast majority of our traffic is focused on the ground on the surface

6026 :  i would like to make a case

6027 :  whatever the scenario think about why the box is there and if it is important

6028 :  the best thing is to make sure the box we use isnt a limitation

6029 :  sam is a tomboy with a flat brim hat and straight blond hair down her belly button

6030 :  what hers is

6031 :  i guess it is me but not really

6032 :  one time i tried to organize all of my books by genre

6033 :  i no longer want to get rid of your stress

6034 :  your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response

6035 :  so my goal as a health psychologist has changed

6036 :  stop stop stop

6037 :  it also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress

6038 :  before they went through the social stress test they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful

6039 :  and here the science says yes

6040 :  i was responsible for starting the first online university outside of the us in europe

6041 :  never ever give up

6042 :  whats that marijuana doing for him

6043 :  its about saying

6044 :  these are confidential programs that provide counseling that provide information about

6045 :  this is exactly what change has to be about

6046 :  my answer is always the same

6047 :  our lives are lives of perpetual urgency

6048 :  so today white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history while too often treating black

6049 :  these time space clashes between protesters and police between gentrifiers and

6050 :  but now in the name of urban renewal and progress these communities are pushed out in service of

6051 :  so we typically arrive to events thirty minutes early

6052 :  shouldnt we go ahead with our enlightened progressive selves and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of

6053 :  its at the same frequency as my survey but its so faint

6054 :  otherwise im limited in my journey

6055 :  all that dust has gone

6056 :  the sound waves as the ambulance approached were compressed and they changed higher in pitch

6057 :  and when the very first stars and galaxies switched on they ionized that hydrogen

6058 :  but the view is very different

6059 :  so we should find tens of millions of galaxies

6060 :  were building the square kilometre array a new radio telescope and its going to be a thousand times bigger than the

6061 :  the same thing happens with light

6062 :  its a billionth the size of any of the objects in my survey

6063 :  its possible to do better

6064 :  and were starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest

6065 :  weve looked at our government oversight

6066 :  thank you very much

6067 :  so if you think about that the context the casualness with which we talk about trillion dollar bailout here and trillion there

6068 :  but at the same time this is also a tremendous opportunity

6069 :  continuing education is up

6070 :  all these things together basically created a factor where the consumer drove us headlong into the

6071 :  weve questioned the financial industry

6072 :  seven percent decline

6073 :  weve questioned where were going

6074 :  its been tremendously powerful for consumers

6075 :  you see this rising force in total transparency and openness that companies are starting to adopt

6076 :  we bought extra large cars supersized everything we bought remedies for restless

6077 :  you actually need to organize it

6078 :  lets talk about dentists vasectomies guns and shark attacks

6079 :  everything is focused on betterment training development and moving forward

6080 :  weve questioned the future of capitalism

6081 :  they want these skills

6082 :  that includes cottages and the like but thirty percent

6083 :  people are getting their hands dirty rolling up their sleeves

6084 :  well they have a lot because its their network of people

6085 :  but the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate

6086 :  its you talking to yourself

6087 :  probably not right

6088 :  like i have become this

6089 :  they take more risks

6090 :  so how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller

6091 :  for teenagers its at the lunchroom table

6092 :  where are you being evaluated either by your friends

6093 :  eventually i graduated from college

6094 :  they say youre not going to finish college

6095 :  we make ourselves small

6096 :  get your cortisol down

6097 :  so this really spikes your cortisol

6098 :  i am actually doing this

6099 :  even the bbc and the new york times

6100 :  get your testosterone up

6101 :  thats what you want to do

6102 :  configure your brain to cope the best in that situation

6103 :  i was thrown from the car

6104 :  and we made an oil thats similar to palm oil

6105 :  we began working with manufacturers to scale up this technology and were currently working with them

6106 :  we havent yet gone to another planet

6107 :  on a long space journey you simply wouldnt be able to pick up any carbon along the way so youd have to figure out

6108 :  so you and i are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests

6109 :  we havent yet gone to mars

6110 :  so in this way a closed loop carbon cycle is created

6111 :  they took me to buy my prom dress

6112 :  im like im from georgia i get that

6113 :  and the evening after her funeral i was sitting and reading her obituary over and over

6114 :  and she said well she lives in louisiana

6115 :  im assuming that we all want to live happy lives right

6116 :  the physical world is our framework for interpretation

6117 :  one thousand two hundred and seventyfive people responded to the survey prompt what is a fake piece of hair worn

6118 :  some is bought

6119 :  so number one

6120 :  i look it up

6121 :  by combining the data into one landscape its easier to integrate the three types of data

6122 :  and this brings us to number three

6123 :  he said their tracks were slightly larger

6124 :  ill end on why this is important

6125 :  sixtyfive pounds of manure in one day

6126 :  virtual reality could change this

6127 :  but i wonder how much waste does each produce

6128 :  this is a rich cake

6129 :  and all around the world math is a core subject

6130 :  i truly believe that the drive i have in my teaching is due to the fact that i was denied my own personal

6131 :  the country was divided again so much that our parliament resigned we

6132 :  for almost two years we went all over the country and even visited remote

6133 :  and i thought subconsciously

6134 :  the words i could say but meant the same thing

6135 :  so that exact same thing you said thats how i feel when i was speaking english

6136 :  because they had the answer to what i lacked

6137 :  who talked the most

6138 :  the problem at hand

6139 :  sally hustles seashells on the beach

6140 :  aslan if you want to be successful you have to get out of the comfort zone

6141 :  without skipping a beat everyone there would say my name

6142 :  if i run the most miles i will get the prize and i will earn the respect of these kids that tease me

6143 :  so for words that meant the same thing but only had two syllables compared to a word that had three syllables i would say the word

6144 :  well i ran the most miles i got the prize i got some respect but that didnt change my speaking

6145 :  unfortunately few americans have seen one because its been thirtyeight years since one last touched the

6146 :  well soon it was obvious it was getting dark

6147 :  i studied physics in college

6148 :  i mean the day remained bright

6149 :  so i talked to my husband and we thought well february

6150 :  and the astronomer i interviewed him and he explained what was going to happen and how to view it

6151 :  i used to be a science correspondent for npr

6152 :  well the day of the eclipse found us and many other people out behind the hyatt regency on the beach

6153 :  i dont believe in god

6154 :  but it got my attention and so i did some research

6155 :  you might chase something else

6156 :  you can help too whether you are a father brother husband or son you can help by empowering women

6157 :  this is where internalized misogyny comes in

6158 :  we had set designs

6159 :  we dont shy away from the more traditional methods like direct instruction when its the best way

6160 :  we were writing a piece where we were trying to illustrate the consumption waste

6161 :  but we knew what we were passionate about and it was a whole series of things that we had never seen

6162 :  at blue man group iteration was essential for our creative process

6163 :  wed actually done almost no theater

6164 :  well i am glad you asked

6165 :  imagine if you did this in every area in your life

6166 :  a lot of people ask me daniel how do you find these people

6167 :  and leaders are readers

6168 :  financially for promotions for your family and you wrote your goals on every day

6169 :  so get around people who can

6170 :  i hope you guys enjoy it

6171 :  it was simply this

6172 :  but right before the campaign launched my boss recommended that we try some ad variations that were completely different than the

6173 :  i would say things like oh i ll get to it one day

6174 :  and that was

6175 :  when in actuality it s not about the resources you have it s about the resourcefulness of you as an individual

6176 :  especially for someone like myself who has the advantage of working at home on a daily basis more often than not

6177 :  i started learning marketing tactics and strategies that way

6178 :  but all kidding aside in my line of work what i get to work with is data analytics statistics and ad variations

6179 :  but here s the thing

6180 :  and this realization came over me

6181 :  it s not that i am my greatest opposition i m also my greatest ally

6182 :  i had no idea what the hell i was doing

6183 :  or i would but i just don t have the skillset

6184 :  one has to be listening

6185 :  so if you re waiting i m sorry to say youre going to wait a lot longer

6186 :  let s take a look at a fun example here

6187 :  we say oh i have a job i have kids i have a girlfriend i have school there s just not enough time in the day to do

6188 :  you don t either and that s okay

6189 :  that s actually how i got started with my career

6190 :  and to leave you with a quote from the poem invictus

6191 :  and here s the thing about that

6192 :  then after months and months of going back and forth with them through email giving them free writing content

6193 :  a good example is this

6194 :  if you want something in life you have to risk it to get the biscuit

6195 :  and that s the time limitation

6196 :  so for me i would use the procrastination limitation

6197 :  so the priority no

6198 :  it ll seldom fall on your lap throughout your lifetime

6199 :  there are seven days in a week and someday isn t one of them

6200 :  is this where you want to be

6201 :  early two thousand and eleven it was kind of limited

6202 :  which is obviously the first idea you get when you create something right

6203 :  theres no centralized bank

6204 :  who owns that fortune

6205 :  but theyre not using courts theyre using self arbitrating contracts with ethereum technology

6206 :  were going to be talking about bitcoin

6207 :  so a bit of my background

6208 :  this is going to obliterate todays banking

6209 :  i sent a value of a cup of coffee

6210 :  it has some way to go in terms of usability and in particular with storing and keeping bitcoin

6211 :  it roughly doubles the profit margin

6212 :  theres a small asterisk there

6213 :  you can buy that with bitcoin today

6214 :  this is a matter of seeing that technologies in the pipeline are actually outcompeting the government and the core

6215 :  because i love seeing my name on twitter especially when i say something dumb thats funny

6216 :  and thats whats happening now

6217 :  but this is going to change

6218 :  it was ridiculous

6219 :  those girls are really nice

6220 :  maybe they can

6221 :  we can switch them off

6222 :  do you have any idea of what theyre going to do with that xbox

6223 :  i made a project for ted

6224 :  my path was clearly marked i had to perfect enrich and express myself in a work of art that would

6225 :  when i came across this quote by simone de beauvoir memories came flooding back to me

6226 :  instead of viewing clouds as an obstruction to a clear sky i encourage us all to acknowledge

6227 :  in some instances that can account for up to as many as fifty of the hurricane

6228 :  yes but stars actually cant produce anything heavier than iron so thats where the mighty neutron comes in

6229 :  well they kind of get unstable

6230 :  there was a very small group of people that saw these documents and saw the same vision for the future that the original

6231 :  back in one thousand nine hundred and seventytwo the federal government finally decided to end it

6232 :  in the case of a uranium fueled reactor we could control the reaction rates by controlling the amount of neutrons that

6233 :  this is how nuclear reactions work

6234 :  we can use that and once its done we can throw that into a landfill and its essentially back as radioactive as

6235 :  with nuclear reactors its different

6236 :  in the early 2000s they were finally declassified and released to the public

6237 :  in addition to that with the thorium fuel cycle we are able to generate additional isotopes

6238 :  two weeks before it was supposed to take off and fly for use in the military the program got canceled

6239 :  these are isotopes used in medicine so these are used in everything from radiation

6240 :  however i couldnt help but look back and think to myself

6241 :  however they would check up on me

6242 :  a research study that im conducting right now shows evidence that the amount of brain processing power that it takes to

6243 :  even more so one of my internet friends was actually a medical researcher and he connected me with some of

6244 :  a great example of this is game called dragon box that teaches algebra through play

6245 :  video games define our world

6246 :  and today with only three hours of time i accomplished a major goal in my life and i

6247 :  id people who later told me that they thought i was dead

6248 :  throughout the next two years i slowly began to recover

6249 :  i have always found that the best way to learn is through play and that makes video games the best

6250 :  well im a gamer and i play around three hours of league of legends every day

6251 :  we all lived with the constant fear that i could die at any moment

6252 :  it doesnt matter if they are

6253 :  these games like league of legends were not designed to help me

6254 :  through my studies i found that video games are actually amazing tools for environmental

6255 :  not because i was in pain or because treatment was difficult

6256 :  video games are not just toys for kids and we must treat them with a practical perspective

6257 :  challenge is actually a very unique trait found in video games

6258 :  and thats right

6259 :  with the recent expansion of virtual reality technology companies ceos are able to have in person

6260 :  giving them hope and giving them inspiration

6261 :  i was following

6262 :  and i am old

6263 :  but its always light blue

6264 :  and a couple of times she sort of greets

6265 :  it could be a dress

6266 :  it could be a suit

6267 :  i remember them

6268 :  always with a smile

6269 :  im not going to do it again

6270 :  it could be a gown

6271 :  and im trying to tell them guys

6272 :  he could rest

6273 :  ive done this

6274 :  send me more of these machines

6275 :  the hospitals maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were

6276 :  we de averaged them and broke them down into different skill levels and what we found

6277 :  and companies will look for talents somewhere else

6278 :  we wont grow anymore

6279 :  now the short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in

6280 :  if they are the scarce resource we have to understand them much better

6281 :  last year we just hit over six hundred thousand so half of my number

6282 :  it was a gray november day and i was overdue

6283 :  so what does this mean

6284 :  so i wont say that we were cocky we were feeling really confident because wed just come over the pyrenees

6285 :  and they said were waiting for justin hes in a wheelchair we want to get him over this mountain pass

6286 :  who knows why these people did what they did to help me

6287 :  but before we do that i want to kind of get you up to speed on what we actually did this past summer

6288 :  and some lives triumph in the face of that adversity and some lives dont

6289 :  and they said all right well stop

6290 :  there is a cathedral that we ended at

6291 :  have any of you ever had a challenge thats so great that you knew there was no way you could accomplish it on your own

6292 :  it will get you through the obstacles that you are inevitably going to face

6293 :  remember the wordle that youre going to see now for the first time

6294 :  my take away from that is that if you want to change someone elses mind you have to have your own

6295 :  mccallum about two weeks ago

6296 :  i went to new york

6297 :  a conviction review unit is essentially a unit in a prosecutors office where prosecutors

6298 :  and one of the things he said when we met with him is that he now has dedicated

6299 :  so we took a close look

6300 :  so im a harvard law professor and the last several years i have worked on

6301 :  i can see it

6302 :  and he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right

6303 :  there may possibly be a third alternative

6304 :  my nerves took over everything

6305 :  doctors and nurses can get better at asking about the context of patients lives not simply because its better

6306 :  we need many more of them in the healthcare system if were truly going to have it be effective to move from a sickcare system to a healthcare

6307 :  for instance that would mean that we need twentyfive thousand upstreamists by the year two thousand and twenty
6308 :  over time theyre successful but not really as much as they want to be

6309 :  its one two and three

6310 :  do you have roaches in your home

6311 :  but we have various tools youve seen some already not in just my talk in others where can test

6312 :  so the best the cheapest we can do for raw dna synthesis is on the order of one hundred to two hundred base

6313 :  its not a relationship

6314 :  and it touched something within them

6315 :  by now we knew what we wanted to do

6316 :  and we were over the moon

6317 :  that all started with a local tv news crew coming to our booth

6318 :  we the people in the white shirts the red ties and the pin stripe suits its time for us to take over

6319 :  there is a power gap

6320 :  he said something that is really sort of lit the path for me

6321 :  there is an institutional gap

6322 :  and you know the security environment there it was tough

6323 :  you know i started this company because i believed that women could really throw their shoulders and be

6324 :  if you think about things in the united states like the anti sopa movement if you think about the revolutions in the middle east

6325 :  one thing thats much more true today than was true one thousand two hundred and ninetyeight
6326 :  where is the institutional basis upon which we can now govern

6327 :  where is nelson mandela

6328 :  ive been in so many countries where women do two three of the work for one three of the

6329 :  i hope one day to be an old man

6330 :  and then like many people i was inspired to begin a life of public service

6331 :  she now employs seventy other women

6332 :  and i think that other countries are ought to do the exact thing

6333 :  empowering women economically and in the security domain is not a moral issue

6334 :  and what i want to do for these fifteen minutes well share five things well share five
6335 :  so this young woman maria umar started the womens digital league

6336 :  i now have seventy women who work for me

6337 :  ive got clients in the united states in the east asia in the united arab emirates

6338 :  think about the good friday accords in northern ireland in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight
6339 :  forty of americas gdp is equal to six trillion dollars of annual economic activity

6340 :  it is time to make america great

6341 :  as recently as two thousand and fourteen they polled one hundred and fortythree countries and they assigned each country a positive

6342 :  and the lowest score any country received was a fortyseven
6343 :  recently presidential candidate donald trump called us all rapists thieves and

6344 :  this is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom

6345 :  so as a result of it you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got

6346 :  im saying this because one of my major points is what went right is also what

6347 :  and by the way mistrust was always very important for democracy

6348 :  so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore

6349 :  you cannot tax them

6350 :  you know who to arrest who to negotiate with

6351 :  and this is goethe who is neither bulgarian nor a political scientist some centuries ago he

6352 :  and i couldnt have predicted this to become so big and successful

6353 :  so i decided to create something new

6354 :  and no wonder

6355 :  to be surprised with those unpredictable turnarounds

6356 :  and why would i do that

6357 :  because a lot of people thought that i have no idea what it really is but it looks so

6358 :  its the other part the heterochromatin that is made of tightly condensed repeat sequences that are just super hard to

6359 :  we go into the arctic we find the really well preserved mammoth bone we take a chunk out of it and bring it back to the lab and we sequence

6360 :  if its what we want to do we will eventually be able to sequence the complete genome of an extinct animal

6361 :  give you a hint is not a very big number

6362 :  we look for frozen bones wherever the permafrost is melting along riverbeds around lakes and at active gold mining sites

6363 :  and to some extent thats absolutely true but there is another problem

6364 :  not so for the mammoth

6365 :  we will learn how to fix the broken bits so we can start piecing together these little tiny fragments into longer and longer

6366 :  but as we progress toward this goal were going to learn a tremendous amount about these extinct animals knowledge that i have

6367 :  when all was put together and mapped to the elephant it looked like about fifty of the mammoth genome had been

6368 :  i could get dna from fossils and use this to watch species evolve through time

6369 :  and its been cold consistently for at least the last million years

6370 :  a rope or a ribbon or party streamers say like those were gonna put up to celebrate the birth of

6371 :  and that is the main reason i noted

6372 :  that kind of thing

6373 :  and we dont use design anymore

6374 :  we want to put it out in the environment and we want it to be powered by the sun

6375 :  you can see how much the spy is happy

6376 :  facebook is a dream place for spies

6377 :  i was sitting there in the audience listening to him and he said about prism and other intelligence gathering

6378 :  now keep that in mind and think about the children of our grandchildren

6379 :  and while it does most of the time sometimes it does not and we must recognize that

6380 :  we need to remove it from that mysterious place it seems to exist and settle it more clearly

6381 :  what is one percent of a billion

6382 :  sounded like a great idea right

6383 :  and this is extremely unusual i mean you go back into history

6384 :  very little rascals our gang style

6385 :  i would love to have that for an earlier time period

6386 :  let me ask you a question

6387 :  and sometimes i get into my head to have a conversation with them about what life was like before the

6388 :  and my daughter think this is hysterical by the way

6389 :  but they havent shut you down if they dont do that now thats whats different than before

6390 :  i knew i was serious about it because i went into my dads wardrobe closet took out like his best shirt im sure he was thrilled

6391 :  this is what the next eddy murphy could do this is what you could co

6392 :  i was joking earlier if you take a big star like an eddy murphy somebody who required like they

6393 :  might not be as good as often as the professional stuff but youd be able to compensate for the lack of

6394 :  nothing that a network news program whatever put on tv but my daughter loves it

6395 :  the real transformation here is that media has been democratized

6396 :  its ten million

6397 :  whats going to happen whats going to happen ladies and gentlemen when five years from now ten years form

6398 :  if they dont like your article the way you wrote theyll reject it

6399 :  theyll get a half million people watching that show and itll be a disaster

6400 :  what that means is youre living in the first era ever where you can decide to be a part of media

6401 :  thats going to be really different

6402 :  we are living through a time that is a creativity revolution

6403 :  were living in an era where media is transitioning from a sort of an aristocratic

6404 :  access to an audience has been democratized

6405 :  i mean to a kid growing up in the 1970s television was a kind of media god i guess you could

6406 :  so if you think about immortality in a sense and the ability to go and create something and

6407 :  thats whats different now

6408 :  now you cant have access to an audience shutdown

6409 :  but the difference is that now sal sees me as a source of support and

6410 :  and she was afraid

6411 :  she was not being stubborn when she reared she was fearing for her life

6412 :  this wasnt working

6413 :  may we always keep it ever close to our hearts

6414 :  there were others that followed in spencers pen strokes

6415 :  of course i practiced my artwork and my handwriting incessantly so much so that i gained a

6416 :  spencers form was not only genius in its appearance but it was a thing of brilliance in

6417 :  the dark areas are lava flows

6418 :  its the erosion of granite rock

6419 :  maybe it has something to do with conflict resolution

6420 :  elegance meets violence

6421 :  and i would love now to start a conversation where we could talk about our favorite stories and exchange the reasons

6422 :  and i was racking my brains and fortunately someone here in the audience saved me because i was looking at the boards that are

6423 :  instead of the monsters that i was looking for that i was hoping to find quite frankly because it would have been very

6424 :  id had enough

6425 :  i didnt want to have anything to do with this anymore

6426 :  can we make ourselves care about them and consider them to be our own

6427 :  and not just be outraged when the victims of violence look like ourselves

6428 :  i felt like that

6429 :  i was too afraid to wipe the spit off my face even as it was mixing with my tears

6430 :  and i also wanted people to understand the deadly consequences of us not taking these problems

6431 :  maybe there are more of my people out there

6432 :  can we find a way to make them feel differently

6433 :  nobody said that

6434 :  theyre also promising our young people the things that they crave

6435 :  i was staring at him

6436 :  so this is the true challenge to public space

6437 :  its something you engage with

6438 :  brianna was struggling in school

6439 :  family independence initiative is a platform

6440 :  i almost lost sight of my own power

6441 :  for my family social connections were key to moving from poverty towards

6442 :  let me tell you about my own blind spot

6443 :  and align yourself to love

6444 :  it is one of the most powerful and wonderful things about it

6445 :  each time that i played i would learn a little bit more about them

6446 :  but there is another way

6447 :  by breaking outside of our friends list we have the ability to connect with social groups of any size

6448 :  im an architect and urban designer and for the past year and a half ive been looking at approaches to death and

6449 :  and theyll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and theyll make a decision

6450 :  but what if ive got a piece of land and i just want to bury a few people like five or six

6451 :  the government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death for example

6452 :  but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities theres much less

6453 :  but theyll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment

6454 :  in fact the surprising thing is that theres no legal obligation on anyone in the uk to provide

6455 :  but thats pretty much it for formal requirements

6456 :  they also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is

6457 :  and you know to a certain extent there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us

6458 :  and the reasons that people give

6459 :  but anyway the council granted these people permission and theyre now trying to build their cemetery

6460 :  so were not thinking about this but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it theyre not taking

6461 :  so about half a million people die in the uk each year and of those around a quarter

6462 :  that no one will want to buy your house at all after that

6463 :  but the difference is for example for childhood cancer

6464 :  it is philosophically very interesting to realize that all our cells are programmed to

6465 :  and the muck

6466 :  so why is it

6467 :  so how do we do this

6468 :  i know how hard it is but you have to make your movies now today features not

6469 :  and this revolution is not just for women

6470 :  just start there

6471 :  it happens because people are just trying to get along within an existing system

6472 :  write letters to eccentric relatives

6473 :  we need you to be very brave

6474 :  and he said yeah

6475 :  i want to see womens bodies on stage on film that arent perfect

6476 :  i mean remember i came here to play smart willful complicated interesting

6477 :  youre much ado about nothing all you do is bite it

6478 :  and what was it about

6479 :  in pre existence of the mathematical biochemical equations the manifestations of rock plant air fire

6480 :  no matter what you say it will never work

6481 :  djing mcing break dancing graffiti art and the fifth element which is the one i want to talk about today

6482 :  what do i mean by that

6483 :  of course im the one with the force

6484 :  im the worst with the words cause i curse all my verbs

6485 :  youre history just like henry iv

6486 :  in two thousand and ten when hurricane tomas hit the island unfortunately many communities

6487 :  we need action in the public sector we need frameworks in public policy we need awareness and investment in the

6488 :  we also know that families neighbours and friends are the ones that help reconstruct

6489 :  and so when we think of resilience this is not an adapt construct its not just a

6490 :  we have more and more disasters

6491 :  two trillion dollars due to damage

6492 :  she was born at the beginning of one world war lived through a second and survived polio

6493 :  disaster risk management is in the building code in japan disaster risk management in the building code is

6494 :  i mean it makes intuitive sense neighbours know which neighbour needs help which neighbour is

6495 :  we know that in fact those strong social bonds are one of the strongest determinants of resilience within the

6496 :  and its getting more difficult

6497 :  so for example changing the heights of roads and things like this

6498 :  resilience is both the need for public policy and the need for

6499 :  the number of natural disasters has actually doubled

6500 :  i think the people of japan know that

6501 :  so this port company was able to see the benefit from investing in their

6502 :  there was a balance a five sided balance

6503 :  and if you look you can see them happening already beginning to emerge

6504 :  the poem is called no man is an island

6505 :  youre beginning to see the emergence of a multi polar world

6506 :  note that when we went into libya it was not good enough for the west to do it alone we had to

6507 :  we had to bring in this case the arab league in

6508 :  those who are interested in poetry the poem is a shropshire lad written by a

6509 :  its also moving vertically

6510 :  they will remain the most powerful nation but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi polar world

6511 :  up until now the united states has been the dominant feature of our world

6512 :  but a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances

6513 :  if paris got together with berlin britain got together with vienna and rome to provide a counterbalance

6514 :  whats happening today is that the power that was encased held to accountability held to the rule of law

6515 :  we are now interdependent

6516 :  command in the world today

6517 :  for power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation

6518 :  you understand that in industry governments dont

6519 :  increasingly we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values

6520 :  of course they are they are a mercantilist nation

6521 :  they want to keep the sea lanes open

6522 :  you in business know that the paradigm structure of our time ladies and gentlemen is the network

6523 :  britain always played to the balance

6524 :  why not in neighbouring somalia

6525 :  our women die of causes that no woman in this day and age where man has reached the moon no woman

6526 :  why not in papua new guinea

6527 :  where am i going to get doctors from to work in somaliland

6528 :  we can deal with a hemorrhage as soon as a woman comes in we have an operating theater that works twentyfour hours a

6529 :  why not in erytrea

6530 :  why not in ethiopia

6531 :  but they take eight or nine years to train and for goodness sakes

6532 :  if it can be done in somaliland it can be done anywhere

6533 :  go and get your heart attack treated somewhere else

6534 :  thats bob interrupting

6535 :  the problem is all the interesting physics happens in the core and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of

6536 :  visible light has a wavelength a size thats much smaller than the things around you the features on

6537 :  violence becomes a way to express their frustration

6538 :  thats why its so important that we engage them in something theyre passionate about

6539 :  and i realized at that moment i had to find someone who could offer her some guidance

6540 :  i decided to set up a network of partners in the community

6541 :  well quite simply they lost interest

6542 :  but did these jobs really fulfill them as individuals

6543 :  crime becomes a way of survival

6544 :  they had nothing to wake up to in the morning

6545 :  or being completely unaware of your own potential

6546 :  can you imagine being trapped and imprisoned in an environment that doesnt allow you to grow

6547 :  what are their individual passions

6548 :  and their self esteem and self confidence went up once they realized what theyre capable of

6549 :  and therere so many other ways to get involved

6550 :  they had either dropped out of school or were unemployed

6551 :  for the past several weeks shes been taking private lessons with a volunteer fashion design instructor and

6552 :  our online platform which were planning to launch soon will allow anyone of you to contribute to empowering youth in

6553 :  i didnt even know her name or her age but i couldnt get her off my mind

6554 :  ever said that you were just a something

6555 :  is telling me that i dont matter its really easy for me to summon the courage to verbally fight back

6556 :  i said that i was just a mom as a way to protect myself and beat my fellow speakers to the punch in judging

6557 :  and when i say it is an evaluation might it not be that emotions play a role in this

6558 :  already at the very early stage of face processing a social categorization happens

6559 :  hes like my friends are starting a startup in palo alto theres three of them they dont really know

6560 :  and im like thank you man you made the ask

6561 :  so you dont have to quit your job tomorrow

6562 :  but you know what

6563 :  we went out to dinner and i said whats going on man

6564 :  she was working as the marketing director for a jewelry company in san francisco

6565 :  they were talking about making the world more innovative compassionate and sustainable

6566 :  they didnt know who i was

6567 :  we have a plan we think we have a plan

6568 :  can you tell us about that

6569 :  its already with us

6570 :  motion sensors would be installed inside the tiles of bathroom floors to detect the falls of elderly patients whenever they

6571 :  after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the

6572 :  once he stepped onto the floor and out of the bed the pressure sensor would detect an increase in pressure caused by body weight and then

6573 :  but it wasnt a conversation that i ever planned to deliberately have with any of my classes because lets

6574 :  you see thats what a lot of us do in situations like that

6575 :  its not because of all the planning and marking and extra stuff that we do

6576 :  now i was that teacher who had a conversation about being gay with his class

6577 :  the whole situation was whipping through my mind so fast

6578 :  could you imagine what that would look like

6579 :  i could bring them out here

6580 :  in my line of work as high school teacher i hear voices just like that in the hallways i see bullying all the time

6581 :  its a metaphor that not only implies avoiding confrontation but it also

6582 :  at the end of the conversation i had to pick up my cup of coffee that i always have step out into the

6583 :  my students had all kinds of questions for me not about my personal life but about gay history and other

6584 :  you all know the response

6585 :  of all the assignments that i gave that young man all the essays he wrote that moment of

6586 :  the hidden curriculum im talking about is a term that describes all the conversations

6587 :  my anxiety was going up

6588 :  where do these impressions of todays young people come from

6589 :  that moment meant more to me than a building full of people wearing pink shirts and those pink

6590 :  and wouldnt you know it

6591 :  here i was face to face with another football player but this time instead of knocking me

6592 :  kids like noah who sat for over an hour in a mcdonalds feeding and talking to a homeless man

6593 :  so in that moment when i came out to my students it felt as if a bomb had dropped

6594 :  i know everything

6595 :  you have to know he is working two months seven days a week then he gets two weeks off

6596 :  we will dominate everything and everybody is going to pay through their phones

6597 :  forty million people are there

6598 :  you seem to be very happy he said like yeah yeah yeah my daughter passed an exam

6599 :  but it was really great

6600 :  so your wife keeps you up to date with whats going on

6601 :  everybody is working on that

6602 :  we saw all the animals

6603 :  full stop now

6604 :  so how do they get people money

6605 :  thank you very much for having me here

6606 :  he gets automatic payment on his mobile phone from this insurance company

6607 :  sorry for the words

6608 :  these videos dont tell someones whole story

6609 :  whos that person

6610 :  i see that you get very tired

6611 :  try to ask him what do you want to do here

6612 :  because we need to work together refugees and local citizens adding up

6613 :  so refugees can be potential partners and resources of economic change

6614 :  yes i agree

6615 :  i enjoyed working in an open and dynamic environment based

6616 :  heres the last one youre talking to somebody and you say sorry got work gotta go

6617 :  my friends no way they can be that cool and have good of a life

6618 :  they are clustering pretty close to the truth

6619 :  well one study tested this by examining peoples personalities

6620 :  well what explains all these studies

6621 :  it could be reviews

6622 :  you remember those astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before

6623 :  ive thought that many times

6624 :  the person never was at the james hotel

6625 :  how about facebook itself

6626 :  its been reviewed many times

6627 :  were thinking about going on our way

6628 :  whats the next big idea from that

6629 :  what does it mean for us in our lives

6630 :  we email we text we skype we facebook

6631 :  heres one of his bestselling books

6632 :  theyre going to have different patterns of language

6633 :  anybody do any writing today

6634 :  one of these reviews is fake

6635 :  the other review is real

6636 :  remember i study deception

6637 :  you know we always think that hey there are these idealized versions people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives

6638 :  i can assure you theres deception there

6639 :  the person stayed there

6640 :  these are people that are saying look i dont want to talk to you now or i didnt want to talk to you then but i still care about you

6641 :  it could be propaganda

6642 :  how many of you in the last twentyfour hours think back have told a little fib or a big one

6643 :  one of the reasons is pretty simple

6644 :  what does that mean

6645 :  now lets put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms which im sure none of you have been in

6646 :  the government hires these people companies hire them all over the place

6647 :  the eyes do not tell us whether somebodys lying or not

6648 :  they said how big the bathroom was or they said

6649 :  the sock puppet isnt about ambiguity per se

6650 :  thats a long time ago

6651 :  but i want everybody to raise their hand at some point

6652 :  they were constrained

6653 :  that really is strange

6654 :  we can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power and it confers on us a

6655 :  we have two kinds of dna in our bodies

6656 :  so really what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon but a

6657 :  dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like

6658 :  theyve now created an organic robot

6659 :  they have it running through mazes controlling where its going

6660 :  we dont have to do it that way anymore

6661 :  is everything okay

6662 :  and if you think of dogs for example dogs are now intentionally designed creatures

6663 :  i asked him

6664 :  everybody would be much better off

6665 :  last year all the festivities were canceled because of the conflict

6666 :  it was immensely costly and stressful not only to both parties but to their families

6667 :  what do you mean progress

6668 :  it had gone on for two and a half years

6669 :  so can we do that

6670 :  just like that

6671 :  that is code for uneducatable

6672 :  the first medium i felt gave me a voice was music

6673 :  most of our governments perpetuate this lie

6674 :  and also the resilience in the brain can be impaired and that will lead to disorders

6675 :  modern neuroscience has shown they were right

6676 :  it is if were paying off the greek debt every year in the burden of illness produced by

6677 :  all non religious wars

6678 :  it was agreed and things went well

6679 :  they put some money aside to have an emergency evacuation fund

6680 :  so when the marines fly over they dont actually see whats going on

6681 :  i mean this is one hundred humidity this is one hundred miles

6682 :  its also about how appearances deceive how our culture can sweep us along into doing and saying things

6683 :  this sun is not afraid to show his face

6684 :  its furnished at least three science fiction titles i think because it says poems can brings us news

6685 :  poetry helps me want to be alive and i want to show you why by showing you how how a

6686 :  the scottish poet denise riley compares poetry to a needle a sliver of outside i

6687 :  i understand the world best most fully in words rather than say pictures or numbers and

6688 :  poetry can help us live with that

6689 :  because we can change the world we have the ability

6690 :  it cant stop with the launch

6691 :  religious teaching must always lead to action

6692 :  and we need to revive that spirit

6693 :  now why was i so grateful to ted

6694 :  the same applies to educators

6695 :  this is the source of all morality this imaginative act of empathy putting

6696 :  its in his book the four loves

6697 :  because with a few wonderful exceptions very often when religious people come together religious

6698 :  but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since i read it when i was a schoolgirl

6699 :  and ronnie douglas said the same thing

6700 :  my dad told me this years ago

6701 :  both big and meaningful and we need those initiatives

6702 :  you know traffic lights

6703 :  and remember that in these movies its usually worst in the second act when our leads are

6704 :  they dont want to befriend one another

6705 :  well these were exactly the questions that i and my colleague matt feinberg became fascinated with a few years ago

6706 :  fiftynine percent of them made arguments in terms of one of the more conservative moral values and just eight percent

6707 :  they dont want to date one another

6708 :  now yes i know

6709 :  twentyfour years ago i underwent a watershed moment in my life when i survived the attack by a

6710 :  what is my role

6711 :  two thieves broke into the museum of science of coimbra in portugal

6712 :  i go to work every day as an engineer and im paid to dream

6713 :  and it reminded me of my days when i sat in this exact same prison

6714 :  im going to put it like this

6715 :  a film like the duchess which is the story of an 18th century aristocrat had the strap line

6716 :  historical characters like chromewell for example from her own imagination as is the novelists prerogative

6717 :  in one thousand five hundred and seventytwo a new statute suggested that they should be grievously whipped and they should be branded through the ear

6718 :  the other boleyn girl which has eric bana scarlett johansson natalie portman re immagines

6719 :  historians might actually go further say that its a foreign country that its actually an imaginary country that is more

6720 :  history doesnt repeat itself but it rhymes said mark twain

6721 :  one academic we worked with said he had always known that but it was only when he saw it on this doorway which looks a little bit like a

6722 :  how about religion

6723 :  of course we are slightly perversely fascinated by gore

6724 :  is the past a foreign country

6725 :  again the question comes to us

6726 :  women perhaps this is the most bizarre one of all since the time of aristotle through till about the 18th century where

6727 :  do we have a visa

6728 :  occasionally they had stories circulating of a woman or a girl leaping over a fence and then

6729 :  we need to try and understand it

6730 :  so thats a huge project there

6731 :  the chinese have proposed as youre aware several major

6732 :  im sure they can do it if they want to do it

6733 :  and through this process in a simple way the chinese learned the skills of building a

6734 :  can you imagine what the future world will look like

6735 :  one part is about history

6736 :  most recent studies would tell you that media stereotypes surrounding black quarterbacks being

6737 :  itll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog

6738 :  the cell walls looked intact

6739 :  and he said no

6740 :  the grasslands were sweeping away

6741 :  and normally when water freezes as you know it expands and the same thing happens in a cell

6742 :  weve lost a whole family

6743 :  that was a miracle but it was workable

6744 :  and the key question for me was to ask peter has it changed

6745 :  that was not what happened actually

6746 :  and just as everybody got excited about it bang

6747 :  is that all we would do

6748 :  in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals

6749 :  the geneticists laughed

6750 :  we slaughtered them

6751 :  and he told me as it all was flooding back in memories

6752 :  and that was a worry

6753 :  it was nearly eighty years before this that hed been at this hut

6754 :  we need to think about this

6755 :  we found marsupial lions

6756 :  so please join me and lets get to work

6757 :  we notice when those laws are broken and theres some of kind of ramification or punishment

6758 :  so fusion centers are these joint task forces between local state and federal government that are

6759 :  kennedy and his brother robert kennedy who knew about and approved the surveillance of dr

6760 :  but when a president repurposes the power of federal surveillance and the federal government

6761 :  the internal revenue service has disproportionately audited groups that have tea party

6762 :  after all it was john f

6763 :  but at the time dr

6764 :  what more could you ask from a movie

6765 :  it was not as his biographer put it the fortune either financial or personal

6766 :  he knew the cable business intimately and for all its flaws tci was the fourth largest cable company in the united states at that point in a

6767 :  heres some back story

6768 :  i find them daunting a little bit unsettling

6769 :  and if i recognize it will i have the guts to make the leap myself

6770 :  now those are the legends

6771 :  and then i called the director andrew v

6772 :  i have to be perfectly honest

6773 :  mclaglen who was ninetyone years old and still directs plays up in friday harbor washington and the story goes more like this

6774 :  my friend invested five seconds

6775 :  how do we take stuff off your plate

6776 :  how do we free up mind space for you because i know this is stressful for you

6777 :  so his approach was

6778 :  its not okay so far its actually a train wreck

6779 :  after christmas i was out with another friend who knows tyler well and i had mentioned what had happened to tyler

6780 :  why do we feel so pleasurable

6781 :  my energy level after the first conversation was through the floor

6782 :  ziad is taking a classic parenting approach assuming that he knows best and

6783 :  what was it like the first time you saw him again

6784 :  i was drawn into the space between

6785 :  and what happened was another whole layer of what matters most came out of a father who almost

6786 :  we frame a power lunch as whos with you and what id say to each of you is i think theres a

6787 :  everybody doesnt need a four year degree but youve got to get yourself to college

6788 :  six years so we know we have to be more educated and we know we have to change how were doing in colorado to

6789 :  this doesnt mean everybody needs a masters what this means is we know that in six short

6790 :  heres what i would distinguish

6791 :  weve been teaching kids for fifty to sixty years about exactly the same way and we know its not working very well

6792 :  not going for the thing you really want because youre afraid you may not get it

6793 :  i think huge emphasis on education

6794 :  they werent blaming the zip code that they were born into

6795 :  usually more often than not her children will end up in the foster care system or with a

6796 :  many women do not have that kind of social support

6797 :  what im going to share with you in the next couple of slides are a little bit more data but dont freak out

6798 :  an inmate is an inmate is an inmate no matter what they did or who they are

6799 :  they werent blaming the cards that they were dealt in life for them being in prison

6800 :  some inmates are more vulnerable than others and more marginalized

6801 :  it means training correctional staff on adequate ways of knowing that their physical

6802 :  it also means understanding that not every womans experience in this world is the same

6803 :  on the surface this kind of custody approach seems to make sense if we treat every

6804 :  do you know who they were blaming

6805 :  when they do its oftentimes in the context of a relationship characterized by

6806 :  they have lots of self defeating attitudes

6807 :  youre entitled to that too

6808 :  i know this in part because this is my story

6809 :  and you might think im talking about toronto

6810 :  a perfect example of this is housing

6811 :  weve flown the cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times flying

6812 :  whether or not there are living organisms there of course is an entirely different matter

6813 :  and that will have to await the arrival back at enceladus of the spacecrafts

6814 :  and the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of

6815 :  a new model for innovation

6816 :  i served six years in that job

6817 :  you cant innovate top down

6818 :  my dad had a phrase not original with him

6819 :  theyve done an incredible job

6820 :  and where are we

6821 :  these folks were not chasing a grant or money

6822 :  pretty amazing stuff

6823 :  thats up fourteen from last year same time period and were on our way to having

6824 :  safety think about this one

6825 :  we have the fastest growing city in the united states when it comes to metropolitan areas

6826 :  i wont go through the whole list on this

6827 :  more and more education is going to be self directed

6828 :  if the evaluator says were successful in five years then the government pays and the investors get

6829 :  we brush off the f you s and find them even when they are hiding from us

6830 :  we dont really put a gps in your drink but we will go for you again and again

6831 :  they are our children

6832 :  our latest obsession is teaching young people about their emotions and how to manage them so they can

6833 :  show up at roca ready to participate and we will show you the door

6834 :  this was not the point

6835 :  so we track them and we track ourselves and figure out if anything we do is of help

6836 :  some young people are in such dangerous gang situations they cant even come in to programming

6837 :  and wed better be relentless and drive each other crazy until we get it right

6838 :  and joe went on to say when i was sitting there waiting for my friend and i thought

6839 :  this became the whole purpose of our work

6840 :  when harvard dug into our numbers it showed that the young people at roca reduced recidivism by

6841 :  and then they would go home deal drugs and shoot people

6842 :  last night i was in the park with my girl and this guy looked at me from across the park

6843 :  so there is some danger that when i tell you that antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to

6844 :  the same studies could be done in the us for patients with meningitis or influenza

6845 :  i believe we are poised for a revolution in how we diagnose and treat infections not just in the us but

6846 :  and unless things change by two thousand and fifty resistant infections will kill more

6847 :  this is just nuts

6848 :  ill think about it roughly

6849 :  i dont think its warranted

6850 :  and i think there are some cases

6851 :  that was the magic number

6852 :  think about it

6853 :  and dopamine is generated which gives us a little high and it kills pain

6854 :  its a remote mountainous zone a blue zone where super longevity is common to both

6855 :  well the short answer to the question is no its not the same thing

6856 :  this is unlike the rest of the developed world where as george burns quipped happiness is having a large loving

6857 :  but heres what i wouldnt tell them

6858 :  how sure are you that what society perceives to be the child left behind is whats not

6859 :  this used to be something that conflicted my thoughts and life

6860 :  so i wouldnt be surprised if any of you asked me

6861 :  what is happiness according to you

6862 :  and why several sim cards

6863 :  these are realities and they are horrific but it is not the only reality

6864 :  and it is happening right now

6865 :  i still love chicken nuggets but now they are vegan

6866 :  she told me that we killed animals for them

6867 :  its actually not

6868 :  it gives them structure

6869 :  it means everybody be quiet and pay attention

6870 :  thats when love begins

6871 :  do you understand

6872 :  attaboy youre learning fast

6873 :  and so my whole life then was dedicated to rotc and the military

6874 :  they come to respect him

6875 :  and then you can support us

6876 :  and so i play a little game with them before i make them stand at attention

6877 :  were investing in our future

6878 :  no slouching no pants hanging down none of that stuff

6879 :  and thats what i found

6880 :  we teach them how to go right face left face so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying

6881 :  they kept us in play

6882 :  america has paid me

6883 :  everybody start chatting

6884 :  no excuse sir

6885 :  but sir no dont tell me how often you scraped your face this morning

6886 :  children need a network

6887 :  every nation touches us

6888 :  i see you on television

6889 :  its part of the answer

6890 :  thats why we need sound immigration policy

6891 :  im your worst nightmare

6892 :  and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children

6893 :  i make them stand at attention like a soldier

6894 :  thats when structure begins

6895 :  lets do more for our teachers

6896 :  i spend a lot of time with youth groups and i say to people when does the education process begin

6897 :  were always talking about lets fix the schools

6898 :  does it begin in first grade

6899 :  but now im alone

6900 :  and i also had this extended network

6901 :  i even did it when i was secretary of state

6902 :  this is easy

6903 :  thats whats going on

6904 :  in the case of these southern scandinavians living near the coast they were fishing marine fish

6905 :  it wasnt a baby she was three

6906 :  but cambodia is not alone

6907 :  this is fantastic

6908 :  i used to think well is it cambodia

6909 :  whats going on

6910 :  he was born in a prison with almost nothing no material goods but he had a sense of his own heroic journey which i

6911 :  and when they brought her case to the judge for the first time he stood up and he said yes theres no evidence

6912 :  she was pregnant at the time

6913 :  so its an online contest where its only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing

6914 :  or a woman i picked up her baby really cute baby i said your baby is so cute

6915 :  or is it other countries

6916 :  they were torturing everybody all the time

6917 :  so lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases

6918 :  she had cigarette burns on her

6919 :  and after a pause they said they had been tortured

6920 :  a judge would let her out

6921 :  i said im gonna copy this

6922 :  and most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine and they looked forward to him

6923 :  but i said to them i just have one question which is by the time that everybody got to the prosecutors

6924 :  it had everything in it

6925 :  it was perfect

6926 :  what can we do

6927 :  we have a program called justicemakers and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things

6928 :  but im one

6929 :  americas young women are running out of oxygen

6930 :  this is nice

6931 :  this has been termed the magic number seven

6932 :  you have people randomized to either receiving the treatment which is the working

6933 :  if i were to test you you would remember roughly seven items here

6934 :  thats a bit harder

6935 :  so the magic number seven isnt so magic after all

6936 :  when we looked at the test results we could see that children doing the training they have

6937 :  and now we have more than fifty thousand children that have

6938 :  capacity to store information is limited

6939 :  does it matter

6940 :  so the same task

6941 :  so one way to put that is you need to remember what to focus on

6942 :  most of what they said to her when she was outside began with be careful watch out

6943 :  but the problem is when fear is the primary reaction that we teach and encourage in girls whenever

6944 :  now the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me that her young daughter was a big scaredy cat

6945 :  so one day a call came in for a fire and sure enough when my engine group pulled up there was black smoke billowing

6946 :  i was getting outside my comfort zone i was calling upon my resilience and i was finding

6947 :  but i started to realize something

6948 :  you can think of the cliche examples like elon musk richard branson steve jobs

6949 :  whoever inspires you the most the question is

6950 :  or we think were the only one with a home thats broken but were meant to pretend its not broken we

6951 :  and we are always saying yes or no to it

6952 :  i assume someone tells you

6953 :  it infects a lot of people

6954 :  in fact i believe to some degree all of us experienced as a child times when we would actually step

6955 :  so why i am a huge fan of weirdness is its my dogmatic belief it always leads us

6956 :  but were talking about me not you so enough about you

6957 :  shes talking about weirdness

6958 :  how would you know if youre a doctor

6959 :  as long as im worshiping other peoples approval i can never accept myself

6960 :  and i like doing that

6961 :  because if were not willing to embrace discomfort that means i am always always always

6962 :  so you relate people that you wouldnt relate and you can actually also create

6963 :  so i connect the eye and then i play the audiences faces

6964 :  they have similar sound of eyes

6965 :  and after some time this perception became a feeling

6966 :  i think this will be a big big change that we will see during this century

6967 :  and also some rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes and some bjork or madonna

6968 :  i didnt have to think about the notes

6969 :  and matthieus happiness measure is off the charts

6970 :  and one of our most popular managers jokes that this is what he says google is a place where

6971 :  and he calls them level five leaders

6972 :  it creates a vibrant energetic community where people admire and respect each other

6973 :  in other words compassion is the way to grow level five leaders

6974 :  and sometimes it gets big enough to become official

6975 :  google is a company born of idealism

6976 :  she ran and managed to escape

6977 :  and she did

6978 :  and by that time the women are yelling and screaming inside the car

6979 :  what can i do for them

6980 :  they are training to be lawyers

6981 :  my heart was in afghanistan

6982 :  but everybody was happy to see me

6983 :  they didnt know why they didnt take me away

6984 :  i said nothing

6985 :  whats wrong with you

6986 :  i wanted to go back home

6987 :  there is no doubt in my mind

6988 :  they said no

6989 :  in one year five hundred thousand refugees went across the island

6990 :  so while its reasonable to ask the question its not reasonable to say that refugee is another word for terrorist

6991 :  and so my answer would be the leadership has got to come from below not from above

6992 :  get no education at all and three quarters of secondary school age get no education at all

6993 :  thats what long term displacement means

6994 :  its a home to ninety thousand people

6995 :  what happens is they take risky journeys

6996 :  the most vulnerable refugees need to be given a new start and a new life in a new country

6997 :  refugees seeking sanctuary have seen the west as a source of hope and a place of

6998 :  they were supported into work

6999 :  they do come from faraway parts of the world

7000 :  she was born to refugee parents and now shes a refugee herself in lebanon

7001 :  its also revealing about whether we know our own history

7002 :  it was decades before the term black hole was coined and people realized that black holes are real

7003 :  itll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the big bang which brings us that much closer to

7004 :  he thought nature would protect us from their formation

7005 :  i learned what it felt like to be truly cold

7006 :  and what if somebody finds out that i dont deserve to be here

7007 :  so theres a term for this and its called the impostor syndrome

7008 :  in fact when i was in high school my geometry teacher would actually let me teach class for her if she was going to be gone

7009 :  i just gave it away

7010 :  the role model piece is so important

7011 :  thats one million on top of the projected three million

7012 :  no theyre in fact two sides of the same goal to understand preserve and improve life into the

7013 :  there are many excellent reasons to go to mars but for anyone to tell you that mars will be there to back up humanity

7014 :  it was knock you off your feet lying on the cold bathroom floor alternating between

7015 :  we can track the formation of galaxies

7016 :  so i wanted to take a minute to look back briefly at one of the still images from the

7017 :  we can track the very first stars that formed in the first few hundreds of millions of years after the universe was

7018 :  how advanced could very advance life become

7019 :  what is the future of an intelligent civilization

7020 :  and that reflects the lifetime of the civilizations that might be

7021 :  the last couple of centuries have been a triumph of modern astronomy

7022 :  and even more amazing than the fact that a self replicating organism somehow came

7023 :  we need to individualize screening based on density

7024 :  ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies so its not widely

7025 :  and he happened to tell me about a conference hed just returned from in israel where they were talking about a new type of

7026 :  and im very happy to report that were now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one

7027 :  you may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study thats regulated by

7028 :  both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram and the x ray often

7029 :  for women without dense breasts mammography is the best choice

7030 :  she and i were both very pregnant at that time and my heart just ached for her imagining how

7031 :  but for women with dense breasts we shouldnt abandon screening altogether we need to offer them something

7032 :  i know that in order for my body to produce milk i have to be pregnant and give

7033 :  i gave birth

7034 :  i cant believe you eat that food and thats your exercise regimen

7035 :  success in your life your relationships in your friendships in your marriage parenting your

7036 :  and its not just atrazine theyre exposed to

7037 :  and so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn

7038 :  so it really makes you realize the onus on parents to have to look at this and regulate this and

7039 :  its a compound thats found in polycarbonate plastic which is what baby bottles are made out of

7040 :  and what does it say about any individual like me

7041 :  and maybe were excited about making some discovery that helps one of the worlds big problems like climate change

7042 :  and its the system that just has to change

7043 :  projects like the allan institute in seattle whose mapping of the brain is being shared with the

7044 :  and does it deliver

7045 :  we still really dont have an idea about what causes it

7046 :  thats a lot of money

7047 :  we use the same incentive system the same system of science as all around the world

7048 :  we need to remember what pasteur said more than a century ago

7049 :  in an open science world if canadian scientists work in a certain area and let the world know then other people around the

7050 :  and that quarter of a trillion dollars i told you about if we keep dividing it up by country and

7051 :  do you realize its been two hundred years since parkinson described the disease named after him

7052 :  im an irrelevant cog in the machine

7053 :  academics have used our reagents to make breakthrough discoveries in cancers that are

7054 :  around the world were spending about a quarter of a trillion dollars every year on biomedical research a quarter

7055 :  we need your help

7056 :  any experiment thats been done here in canada is likely taking place in ten other places around the world at

7057 :  for example we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague with whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable

7058 :  in what other parts of our lives perhaps that we care more about are we working hard but not improving

7059 :  this has been shown to be true in teaching general medicine nursing and other fields and it happens because

7060 :  he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors but he also realized that being a lawyer

7061 :  a tightrope walker doesnt practice new tricks without a net underneath and an athlete wouldnt set out to first try a new move

7062 :  it can also be motivating and it provides us with information to identify what to focus on next when we go back to the

7063 :  it is this type of practice in the learning zone which leads to substantial improvement not just time on

7064 :  of course he studied a lot

7065 :  this is a stark contrast to the calm watery like sound of impressionism

7066 :  i love the jazz greats

7067 :  there are five in the set

7068 :  its not working how i want it to work

7069 :  its like a concrete doughnut

7070 :  then i had to battle bay area traffic for over two hours

7071 :  i dropped everything

7072 :  the scary fact is its an arms race we can never win

7073 :  i had to rush home

7074 :  if you have a mouse in your house you set traps to try to kill that mouse

7075 :  but that fight is not occurring in isolation

7076 :  how do we fight infections

7077 :  we are all terrified of that threat

7078 :  but after i heard his symptoms i knew exactly what had happened

7079 :  the first step to this is really changing our perspective going from how do we fight

7080 :  actually nothing serious did go wrong with his surgery

7081 :  it protects us from mortality by preventing and fixing the collateral damage that

7082 :  it felt like i couldnt get there fast enough

7083 :  i think thats amazing

7084 :  i know that a single word change from fight to survive seems simple but by making the single

7085 :  i had to get to the hospital to be with him and to talk with his doctors

7086 :  if we really had such great success with the early generation antibiotics how is it possible that we

7087 :  i sat there for a week with my dad and i can remember obsessively watching his vitals monitors

7088 :  your microbiome is absolutely essential for your health

7089 :  but if you leave here with one thing today i want you to leave here believing that there is hope to get us out of

7090 :  we have to make that shift because its only then when well truly be able to close the

7091 :  we should be asking how do we survive infections

7092 :  how could twelve hours ago my dad be perfectly healthy and discharged from the hospital

7093 :  they freaked you out right

7094 :  so if weve been asking the wrong question what is the question that we should be asking

7095 :  think about when you watch movies like contagion or outbreak

7096 :  as a result we declared a war against infectious diseases

7097 :  we couldnt imagine that anything serious could possibly go wrong

7098 :  but that combat does not occur in isolation

7099 :  we are using the microbiome to teach us how to turn tolerance defenses on to teach us what they

7100 :  so what do we do

7101 :  we put all our efforts into developing weapons in the form of antibiotics and antivirals

7102 :  we take a variety of approaches to address this goal but one of our main approaches that were really excited

7103 :  but bacteria and viruses are incredibly slippery targets

7104 :  its not surprising that the microbes have evolved resistance to our new weapons

7105 :  i was certain that he was going to be gone by the time i got to the hospital

7106 :  right now all of you have about three pounds of bacteria that are living on you body surfaces

7107 :  something that can happen is whats called the collateral damage of war which is the unintentional or

7108 :  we all know that our bodies have an immune system and this immune system is important for recognizing

7109 :  and i found that it can give you better search results

7110 :  but if you do the search for the american spelling the number one search result is some trendy iphone photo sharing app

7111 :  we decided to see if we could change their mindset

7112 :  and so i want to follow my own darn advice

7113 :  where new star systems are being born

7114 :  our system is one of many systems in this galaxy

7115 :  the creation of higher elements happens where carbon is made where nitrogen is made

7116 :  the video begins and ends with this man

7117 :  who paid for this

7118 :  were one of many planets in this solar system

7119 :  bruno said wait a minute

7120 :  they see amino acids in stellar nebula where new stars are being born

7121 :  where the calcium thats in your bones is made

7122 :  maybe five years maybe ten maybe twenty maybe fifty but of these thousands of planets that were discovering

7123 :  why are we so fascinated by everything that we find in the night sky

7124 :  i think thats why people want to be a part of space

7125 :  what is it about space

7126 :  why did red bull pay for this

7127 :  and he displaced us from the center of the universe to just be one of many in the universe so we could see him

7128 :  with his company

7129 :  and you did

7130 :  laughing pay for a ticket to go into space with this guy

7131 :  and i think that thats an idea worth sharing

7132 :  theres a lot about space that keeps us interested

7133 :  forty year crime low so much so i had other commanders call me hey mel whatcha doin man

7134 :  i had to figure out how to do that

7135 :  and i believe we are back on that road and im so excited about it

7136 :  we would retire and i would go off into the sunset maybe do ministry full time love my wife a long time

7137 :  and so thats the reason for me several years ago

7138 :  thats a great arm protection

7139 :  we all want love

7140 :  we all want respect for one another

7141 :  i was just so tired

7142 :  you know what

7143 :  because we have the same goal we all want peace

7144 :  i know who i really am now

7145 :  now why a game

7146 :  it just vanished

7147 :  i have confidence in you

7148 :  so everybody ready

7149 :  now let me tell you that story

7150 :  waste of life

7151 :  i understand myself better

7152 :  i mean if it hadnt worked for me theres no way i would have believed it was possible

7153 :  and i feel like you can do it

7154 :  how do you get from trauma to growth

7155 :  i dont want gamers to regret the time they spent playing time that i encouraged them to spend

7156 :  pretty clever right

7157 :  i have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life

7158 :  thats all it takes

7159 :  you werent going to have them anyway

7160 :  so tackling a tiny challenge without giving up even one as absurd as snapping your fingers

7161 :  every single second that you are not sitting still you are actively improving the health of your heart and

7162 :  it gets stronger the more you exercise it

7163 :  so if you spend these seven and a half minutes today doing something that makes you

7164 :  but how does it work

7165 :  suppose i had said

7166 :  and i tell them you cant

7167 :  its a fifty fifty chance right

7168 :  we may not know how or what but its going to be different than it was

7169 :  im not helping them avoid doing the wrong things they are smart enough to figure out what they need to do in their business

7170 :  we think information is power

7171 :  what did i ask you to do

7172 :  that makes a little bump on your bmp

7173 :  i did study theology

7174 :  it would have been better if youd have been from a small town

7175 :  they always say its the best

7176 :  were all lucky

7177 :  and he said good luck

7178 :  and so this is kind of just a conversation with the crowd

7179 :  im at the point now where i cant hear or see

7180 :  all you from oklahoma city and tulsa too bad

7181 :  were lucky to be from oklahoma

7182 :  and then interestingly brians from bartlesville

7183 :  by golly he said youll be out of here in june of fiftyone
7184 :  there wasnt anybody standing behind me

7185 :  ive been wealthy

7186 :  and now unusual for most boys but now my dad was not only my

7187 :  and ive enjoyed giving it

7188 :  but we love to have a big one

7189 :  i have been generous

7190 :  he could play the big time

7191 :  and somebody would say ed play up

7192 :  ive had the money to give

7193 :  he said son youve never had a plan and then he said a fool with a plan can beat a

7194 :  before anything else you get that money first

7195 :  by no means did i have money

7196 :  they dont want to seem boring

7197 :  i have two reasons why that is

7198 :  they could see the strategy involved

7199 :  many of you might say id prefer to see it or id prefer to hear it or id prefer to actually do it

7200 :  or we dont really think about all the dreams weve had that dont come true

7201 :  mostly what you learn in the classroom is much more conceptual or meaning based

7202 :  people dont like to be right to be wrong i should say

7203 :  more often than not we try to prove ourselves right

7204 :  or how would you like to study

7205 :  i will say that when we survey people many people say they have preferences

7206 :  this whole idea that learning styles dont exist in many ways should be further good news because it means all of us are

7207 :  we have to make connections to it connecting it to our experiences or coming up with our own examples or thinking

7208 :  learning styles just isnt one of them

7209 :  but by saying that learning styles dont exist im not saying people are the same

7210 :  so if i asked how would you like to learn something

7211 :  we notice when we have that moment of d j vu

7212 :  but again the key is when put to the test these learning styles dont exist it doesnt make a

7213 :  thats not easy

7214 :  more often than not this is unintentional

7215 :  this is subconscious

7216 :  we dont notice all the times that were thinking of someone and they dont call us

7217 :  and this basic finding by the way has been extended to other contexts everything from chess to basketball to

7218 :  the fact that learning styles dont matter to some extent should be a relief because its one less thing teachers have to

7219 :  but again its really important that were willing to let our guard down sometimes and challenge our beliefs and

7220 :  no one had ever done it

7221 :  what is the leading cause of stress in your life

7222 :  but theres another world too

7223 :  my mother phoned minutes later

7224 :  a few days later we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and sat around her casket

7225 :  i knew she had come to say goodbye

7226 :  and for that work when i was a final year law student i was chosen as the young australian of the year

7227 :  so i followed my hunches

7228 :  we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her

7229 :  i looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side

7230 :  if we were captured first my sister and i then she and my grandmother would drink

7231 :  i was asked as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s retired english professor

7232 :  its the best drug ive discovered

7233 :  theyre absolutely right

7234 :  that was the moment at which i realized i needed to learn something about medical marijuana

7235 :  all of us at some point in our lives will face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose

7236 :  medical marijuanas risks we know a lot about the risks of recreational use we know next to nothing about the risks of medical

7237 :  but what scares them more than anything else is this possibility that at some point tomorrow or a

7238 :  they can be dangerous if theyre overused but they can also be ineffective if theyre not used in a way thats consistent with what

7239 :  ive been using it every day since

7240 :  huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks of those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more

7241 :  when i came to see her the next morning i had to admit that it looks like there is some evidence

7242 :  i ended up writing a book based on those conversations and that book really revolved around three surprises

7243 :  but heres the point

7244 :  medical marijuana dispensaries and clinics all across the country are figuring this out

7245 :  so i started reading more articles i started talking to researchers i started talking to doctors and most importantly i

7246 :  and note what i said when not if

7247 :  she was in control

7248 :  people i met were more than happy as i was sitting next to them people like robin to tell me

7249 :  those waiting rooms really are a hive of interaction advice and support

7250 :  in my own practice ive gotten much more creative and flexible in supporting my patients in

7251 :  these are the sorts of questions that make me confident that the person im talking with really has my best

7252 :  asking patients about their hopes their fears their goals and preferences

7253 :  what are you afraid of

7254 :  and third the folks behind the counter

7255 :  it was amazing

7256 :  we need more research into benefits we need more evidence about risks

7257 :  as a palliative care provider i ask all my patients what theyre hoping for and what theyre afraid of

7258 :  those risks may not be as huge and as scary as some of the opponents of medical marijuana would have us believe

7259 :  so i decided to find out

7260 :  that night i read all of those articles and found a bunch more

7261 :  we do need much more evidence about the benefits of medical marijuana

7262 :  many of the drugs i prescribe are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines which can be

7263 :  think about the last time you went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an

7264 :  i got a letter of recommendation that would let me buy medical marijuana

7265 :  these are often small mom and pop operations run by people with no medical training

7266 :  i was amazed at how willing those people were to spend sometimes an hour or

7267 :  and you know what

7268 :  to show you what i mean let me tell you about another patient

7269 :  we need to figure out what their tricks are what their tools are and we need to learn from them

7270 :  how to interact with healthcare providers when to interact with healthcare providers how to use medications

7271 :  but heres the thing

7272 :  we also need to ask the federal government to reschedule marijuana to schedule ii or to

7273 :  and thats a wake up call we really need to pay attention to

7274 :  so i had this problem

7275 :  and at that point i just gave up

7276 :  second time i didnt

7277 :  so i packed everything in the box and i put it in a closet

7278 :  so it sounds like a really big sacrifice like no dining out no going out no buying stuff

7279 :  and i realized that personal project lets you express yourself

7280 :  but actually was probably the best year of my life because i got to do so many things

7281 :  and after a few weeks first i thought it was going to be a weekend project but actually it wasnt

7282 :  and among those e mails i received some really interesting job offers also

7283 :  there are no compromises

7284 :  hell probably tell you that its the one that hes working on right now and its not in his portfolio

7285 :  we worked with some famous museums in bay area

7286 :  so i needed to solve that because going and doing like freelance for full time once again i couldnt have time to do

7287 :  and it was basically the only thing i was talking about to anyone

7288 :  whats so powerful about personal projects

7289 :  i went to bed thinking about this project

7290 :  i started receiving e mails like crazy

7291 :  and these are points that dont relate only to design they relate to anything

7292 :  and after a few days i realized that maybe the best thing to make is a digital clock because theres this notion and flow of

7293 :  so i started thinking what can i make

7294 :  i got to play

7295 :  the first time i failed

7296 :  i woke up thinking about this project

7297 :  it happened to me

7298 :  and thats only because i had limited experience

7299 :  and of course thats what people come to iya for

7300 :  there is a new industry for these places

7301 :  oh theyre going to iya but why

7302 :  this is how it was in meiji

7303 :  and i think we found the way to go forward

7304 :  its there and it can be saved

7305 :  everything looks fine

7306 :  they did all that and it didnt work

7307 :  so thats it and we hope to do this in a big way

7308 :  can we make a little product or a service out of it

7309 :  we went and scavenged the nearby markets and we tried to understand what can we pick up that will make this happen

7310 :  youve got to try it on your own to believe it

7311 :  make sure you write it down

7312 :  give praise for the parts of your body that are working

7313 :  maybe exercise a little bit

7314 :  what matters is what you believe

7315 :  in his mid 20s he had a breakdown

7316 :  self mastery this is your inner work

7317 :  we worked on her belief system

7318 :  you see everyone wants society to change

7319 :  stay behind later

7320 :  turbulent relationships with his family led him to to be thrown out

7321 :  theyre migrants people of color

7322 :  thats not how it works

7323 :  they were sent all over the states to work in hawaii pineapple plantations and washington apple orchards and anywhere the work was

7324 :  if those workers run away they risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented

7325 :  and for populations like these the criminal justice system is too often part of the problem rather than the

7326 :  let me tell you what that looks like

7327 :  i had called her my auntie

7328 :  technology that is proven and effective and safe we now are having debates about walking

7329 :  were now having debates about perhaps using more land resources to produce

7330 :  so as i went into that field and became a geneticist and worked to better improve

7331 :  and i wanted to be part of the team that was going to solve that problem and i wanted to be part of the team that was going to create

7332 :  every input every resource as much water as much soil as much land as we possibly

7333 :  we have to have every bit of science and technology applied to our food system and we have to plant fence row to fence

7334 :  like in the dubai mall they sell frozen yogurt by the gram

7335 :  for example dubai cool place

7336 :  i went down to the lobby and saw this indian guy

7337 :  where ive had problems is in some of the arab countries

7338 :  and its great theres good people everywhere

7339 :  i was in oman and i was in saudi arabia

7340 :  out of my way

7341 :  its three miles away

7342 :  i was in dubai

7343 :  and ive been guilty of stereotyping as well

7344 :  i was in dubai

7345 :  thats what i try and show in my stand up good people everywhere

7346 :  for example i took my two year old son to the playground at the dubai mall

7347 :  he went out solo and did it first

7348 :  i just did a seven country solo tour

7349 :  i want to rob a bank

7350 :  ill be back and he walked away

7351 :  can you say i will kill you in the name of allah

7352 :  all it takes in one person to mess it up

7353 :  i was doing a show and they said well send a driver to pick you up

7354 :  i go im sorry

7355 :  this is the head in hands moment

7356 :  there are two mayor reasons for that

7357 :  and communities are tremendously important

7358 :  not just your texts and tweets but increasingly your spoken words as well

7359 :  go buy a friend a present and come back in three hours

7360 :  thats comparable to not smoking

7361 :  the question then

7362 :  so lets start with high extroversion

7363 :  that is my seat

7364 :  i said yeah my rotor is not bent

7365 :  i think whats that about

7366 :  you were as white as a sheet

7367 :  either that or im as smart as i ever was its just now im constantly being

7368 :  he said i think youre probably right

7369 :  so i can go on vacation or i can get my hair cut

7370 :  when i got to charlotte she called me

7371 :  i was in complete awe because that was like the best hes ever bowled in his entire life

7372 :  and im sitting there and im struggling to get a strike

7373 :  how hard can it be to design a bowling ball

7374 :  then i said

7375 :  but you know what

7376 :  man that was really cool to watch

7377 :  ultimately i was able to bowl for the purdue bowling team as captain and when it came time to graduate

7378 :  i played a small role in his success

7379 :  and this is true for every single cancer

7380 :  our brains are wired to recognize patterns

7381 :  because i wasnt from pakistan

7382 :  but i managed to make room for a copy of the cop twentyone agreement that french president

7383 :  in which we support nonprofits and causes that we like and that we talk about it and we do it

7384 :  but just in case dont forget three envelopes

7385 :  dont be shy

7386 :  probably this generation has something to contribute

7387 :  and that is what we need to change

7388 :  dont take me wrong

7389 :  and also because our legal framework although its not fantastic its also not terrible

7390 :  we do stuff and we talk about it

7391 :  yes those are important questions

7392 :  this is given to patients who have diarrhea like john

7393 :  so i did an experiment in the lab

7394 :  and before we leave this room were going to make sure john gets better

7395 :  the technology i used to understand that is called metabolomics

7396 :  then he or she at that point they both told me that this is the current state where many bugs that we

7397 :  so what is it that we require

7398 :  what is it that we need

7399 :  and unless this is actually internalized it wont happen

7400 :  he came to talk to her and said what is this about

7401 :  father mother this man shall be my wife

7402 :  we need to break down our vision of what planners are of what the correct

7403 :  and she created a dance piece which then prime minister nehru saw

7404 :  so we can run virtual experiments to answer questions like

7405 :  and so the sharing numbers drop to zero

7406 :  so while its very difficult to stop a meme such as thedress from spreading once it

7407 :  it stops because the people that are sharing the dress cant find any new people to share it with

7408 :  so why does the dress stop spreading

7409 :  and not many diseases or populations behave quite so simply

7410 :  its used to investigate the causes and spread of infectious diseases and to help develop strategies to

7411 :  but infectious diseases isnt the only application of mathematics to health problems

7412 :  the number of people who are no longer sharing the dress never quite reaches back up to a population of ten million

7413 :  how many cases could we prevent if we had an effective vaccine against ebola for example

7414 :  so lets take a look at how thedress spreads through a population

7415 :  that actually cause disease viruses and bacteria

7416 :  like that is it speaks to me right

7417 :  which is appropriate because actually this approach is not innovative

7418 :  and once somethings in the commons it will always be there

7419 :  it strikes me that we talk very deeply about design but actually theres an economics behind architecture that we

7420 :  how will finance development

7421 :  how will we sell design services

7422 :  instead get rid of the school bell

7423 :  we can also think of science as being a kind of a jury except its a very special kind of jury

7424 :  well in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making two auxiliary hypotheses both of which we would now

7425 :  and he collected many things including his famous finches

7426 :  why should be believe the science

7427 :  this was a huge confirmation of the theory

7428 :  how can we know whats causing the observed warming

7429 :  its not because of the genius of henry ford or karl benz or even elon musk

7430 :  why do cars work so well

7431 :  so nomological means having to do with laws

7432 :  most of us trust our cars

7433 :  so if you think about it a geologist cant tell you whether a vaccine is safe

7434 :  so why is that

7435 :  so at 238pm on monday women in iceland left work because thats when they had earned their

7436 :  sweeping changes start at the individual family level the family making a decision about

7437 :  i wanted to go to college

7438 :  now indian women were really smart in this situation

7439 :  we looked at it from top down and said we want to have different population numbers over time

7440 :  but the choices have to be made at the family level

7441 :  i had a plan for my future

7442 :  their contraception rate twentynine percent

7443 :  one of the leading causes of economic growth across that region was this cultural trend

7444 :  when they went to get an iud inserted they got paid six rupees

7445 :  we need to look at it from the ground upwards

7446 :  and i think we need to look at it though from a different lens

7447 :  women in africa will tell you over and over again that what they prefer today is an injectable

7448 :  and so i hope theyll feel that im living out what ive learned from them and from the decades of work that ive already

7449 :  and we need to start now

7450 :  thats about what youd expect

7451 :  weve got to give all women access no matter where they live

7452 :  join the conversation

7453 :  we need a groundswell of people saying this makes sense

7454 :  and its actually been a really successfull way of introducing the means of

7455 :  and so instead of reading you can produce things

7456 :  go and get a voice coach

7457 :  you know somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true

7458 :  i mean my goodness you look ugly this morning

7459 :  its the only one that can start a war or say i love you

7460 :  it might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people

7461 :  im not going to get very technical about this for any of you who are voice coaches

7462 :  you have an amazing toolbox

7463 :  that would be a world that does sound beautiful and one where understanding would be the

7464 :  this is a serious point here

7465 :  we complain about the weather sport about politics about everything but actually complaining is viral misery

7466 :  people who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to if they dont have any prosody at

7467 :  of course where this all comes into play most of all is when youve got something really important to do

7468 :  and then roll an r

7469 :  astronaut bill anders frantically asks his crewmates where their camera is grabs the hasselblad points it towards the

7470 :  thats incredibly powerful technology

7471 :  and there were pregnant mothers during that time

7472 :  in rats we do the same thing

7473 :  the problem is we cannot test this in humans because ethically we cannot administer child adversity in a

7474 :  and you can see the two groups of monkeys extremely well separated from each other

7475 :  so in this experiment we took placentas of monkeys that had different social status

7476 :  is there going to be a lot of food

7477 :  i was surrounded by people who were only nineteen years old but they were so open

7478 :  then there is majority a large group of people in the middle

7479 :  go see what it is like in their setting

7480 :  now i know this sounds cliche but few leaders actually follow it

7481 :  reduce the risks

7482 :  its the equivalent of sitting back and watching pools developing a dam over time

7483 :  with health links we invited doctors nurses nurse practitioners dieticians case managers

7484 :  ok so youve surveyed your environment built relationships and trust and now you are that lone

7485 :  in fact our training drives into us the principle of do no harm

7486 :  what most leaders do is make a big mistake

7487 :  have you ever tried to change something but failed miserably

7488 :  but theres a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline

7489 :  i want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference

7490 :  and they say is this tim urban

7491 :  and i say yeah

7492 :  they came and went and i couldnt quite do stuff

7493 :  you invite your friends on a weeknight and theyll give you a percentage of their sales towards your project

7494 :  we were told to expect between three hundred and four hundred dollars

7495 :  i know that ive lived there

7496 :  and we went to work

7497 :  that stretch is cleaner than its been in years

7498 :  afterwards maybe you can tell me why i didnt think of this sooner

7499 :  ask for the part of the story thats not being told

7500 :  now theres just one problem with this line of reasoning and thats that the insula does a lot

7501 :  my colleagues tal yarkoni and russ poldrack have shown that the insula pops up in almost a

7502 :  but the promise of neuroscience has led to some really high expectations and some

7503 :  maybe someday we will but until then we have to be careful that we dont let overblown claims detract

7504 :  a lot of people agree

7505 :  like just a couple of weeks ago neuroscientists at mit figured out how to break habits in

7506 :  but the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time and it affects not just the

7507 :  simple as that

7508 :  and so tired people tend to have higher rates of overall infection and theres some very good studies showing that shift

7509 :  turn off those mobile phones

7510 :  but stress is so much more

7511 :  if you compare an individual who has slept at night or stayed awake

7512 :  do you need that much or do you need more

7513 :  essentially sleep fragments and becomes less robust but sleep requirements do not go down

7514 :  this is the time to be awake

7515 :  its fashionable at the moment because whats been shown is that within the brain a whole raft of genes have been

7516 :  we will win the war on cancer

7517 :  so instead of waiting for cancers to be large enough to cause symptoms or for them to be dense enough to show up on

7518 :  so let me tell you how we do this

7519 :  in fact we lie at the intersection of the three of the most exciting developments within cancer research

7520 :  today over six hundred clinical trials are open actively recruiting patients to explore all aspects

7521 :  for some patients this hundred days means the matter of life and death

7522 :  let me walk you through an example of one patient

7523 :  so then the question is what do we do with this information

7524 :  we then apply statistical and computational methods to be able to find the small signal thats present

7525 :  many of us have lost family friends or loved ones to this horrible disease

7526 :  the key then is to see whether were able to detect these recurrences of cancers earlier than with

7527 :  and at each threshold the going gets tougher

7528 :  so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasnt been

7529 :  when his grandmothers away he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandmas bed

7530 :  in fact just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts these things are also things that

7531 :  i thought he might throw up on me actually

7532 :  these are the sorts of things it makes sense for us to stay away from because they might actually contaminate us

7533 :  but they were fighting it out

7534 :  jc yes there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality

7535 :  that is until i showed her the photos of the supergays that we interviewed in india

7536 :  the west had corrupted me with divergent ideas and if only my parents had never left taiwan

7537 :  but there are also stories of hope and courage in every corner of the world

7538 :  they would be the kind of person that i aspire to be

7539 :  it comes from t mobile

7540 :  it could be salsa music or a comedy routine it doesnt matter

7541 :  i dont know if you realize this

7542 :  but nonetheless if youre a college kid and you have no money believe me this is better than trying to use your

7543 :  and when youre out of the hotspot youre on the regular cellular network

7544 :  so im going to teach you something even better

7545 :  youre thinking well how often am i in a hotspot

7546 :  i know the people who worked on the treo

7547 :  it could be anything

7548 :  im going to talk about the effect of the iphone

7549 :  would you call me please right now

7550 :  you will pay

7551 :  and its so interesting that i thought i would tell you about it

7552 :  nailed that one

7553 :  itd be really really cool and yet even though the technology for this has been available for five years

7554 :  the iphone came out that day

7555 :  the new york times has very rigid policies about that

7556 :  one was from a guy named michael stevenson which shouldnt be that hard to transcribe and it was misspelled

7557 :  finally cingular said ok

7558 :  and they said oh my gosh maybe weve been doing it wrong

7559 :  and dont you all call me at three a

7560 :  the beauty of that is you never miss a call

7561 :  and i am not paid by t mobile

7562 :  they have coverage like the size of my thumbnail

7563 :  can i call you right back

7564 :  its totally free theres not even ads

7565 :  this is my favorite of all time

7566 :  thats who can afford to do that

7567 :  they dont have that kind of money

7568 :  i got two voicemail messages

7569 :  how can it be so good

7570 :  by the way this is something that really bothers me

7571 :  im not plugging t mobile

7572 :  anyway but this teaches people what its like

7573 :  nobody over forty knows how to do that

7574 :  i want to find what

7575 :  is this the kind of simple that looks obvious or the kind that looks profound

7576 :  dont be trendy if you want to be serious

7577 :  maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace a kind of dance where each defines the

7578 :  this one generates no imagery at all

7579 :  but why do we do it

7580 :  and the audience me myself as well were completely off

7581 :  is there a logo or no logo

7582 :  so what we do in our laboratory is we test tv commercials and we monitor activity in the

7583 :  who says if theres expensive clothing im going to donate a smaller amount

7584 :  lets try another one so heres a second example

7585 :  because we identify with them and place our trust in them

7586 :  each of us is coming to terms with our own distinctiveness

7587 :  more specifically how we see ourselves in our minds our personal identities are only ever partially

7588 :  now until i started school i never realized that this length of hair was at all unusual

7589 :  i would dream about just being a girl rather than the girl with long hair

7590 :  but also demanded to be treated as an equal

7591 :  and this is important because identity confers power access and

7592 :  another way of thinking about this is the number of automatic associations we make when we meet someone

7593 :  this is because our reflections are only a mirror image of our true selves

7594 :  hence why politics advertising and social media are such powerful drivers of our thinking

7595 :  one incident that is etched firmly into my memory happened when i was at a school camp age ten

7596 :  so this is just part of a more complex issue

7597 :  thats how we actually look

7598 :  as a young girl i would often stare into the mirror and fantasize about having a short sophisticated bob

7599 :  and that is important

7600 :  as a teenager i had begun to realize that my religion my identity and the physical expression of these

7601 :  how long does it take to wash

7602 :  extroverted personalities such as the kardashians whether you love them or hate them have managed to turn their

7603 :  over my life there have been many experiences like this which have made me want to chop it all off

7604 :  i was standing in my bathroom brushing my hair my mom walked in and just looked at me and said

7605 :  and not one person throughout my entire schooling ever questionned the validity of me performing these

7606 :  now im australian and australians love to drink

7607 :  on a practical level in the united states identity theft deprives the us economy of

7608 :  we might think that we are being perceived in a certain way or believe that our actions are shaping the views of others

7609 :  youve now reached an age where you can make your own decisions and if you want to cut it you can

7610 :  i want to be seen as a nuanced young woman whose experiences and

7611 :  or tell them that youve already had enough to drink

7612 :  but by this stage i was beyond pretending

7613 :  its about recognizing that each individual is complex and capable of the entire breadth of

7614 :  now since i can see youre all wondering im going to give you some answers

7615 :  it came as a shock to be called a freak but what made it painful was that i didnt know this girl in fact

7616 :  and yet as research has shown most of us prefer looking at our mirror image

7617 :  with adolescence came the additional peer pressure of drinking alcohol

7618 :  well as i walk around oxford i see people with tattoos crazy colored hair and punk rock

7619 :  so as i finished my school i began to tell people i dont drink and i dont cut my hair

7620 :  we are more comfortable with things that are more familiar to us even though they may not be

7621 :  first sikhs believe that people were created as they were meant to be and therefore by not cutting our hair

7622 :  we like it simply because it is more familiar to us

7623 :  so its no surprise then that we spend so much of our time thinking about who we are and who we would like

7624 :  now when i ask my friends what defines me they often say that its my interminable sarcasm or my

7625 :  now im sure all of us have experienced that moment when youre walking along in a shopping center immersed

7626 :  at school i quickly became known as the girl with the long hair a catchy moniker but not quite

7627 :  our true selves are captured in a photograph

7628 :  there are three main reasons for this

7629 :  it may surprise you to know that it is the fifth largest religion in the world

7630 :  have you ever cut it

7631 :  one key practice of the faith is not to cut your hair

7632 :  but i quickly caught up and before long had a full head of hair

7633 :  and yet remarkably few of us have an accurate conception of our own identities

7634 :  in fact in australia drinking is more popular than swimming and probably more fundamental to australian

7635 :  i want my quirks and my intricacies to be understood and fully appreciated

7636 :  and my all time favorite have you ever sat on it

7637 :  all she knew about me was that i had long hair

7638 :  they started when i was six and have never really stopped since

7639 :  in two generations

7640 :  if we cant do it why do we have the best public library system in the world right here in toronto

7641 :  and we need to take that language back because we have a right to a great city

7642 :  but the second time i had a real say

7643 :  which i think is what they mean too

7644 :  why havent we built rapid transit

7645 :  because thats the only way people will choose to get out of cars and on to transit

7646 :  people who desperately need rapid transit

7647 :  i chose to live in toronto

7648 :  and people kept up that conversation

7649 :  and i always say

7650 :  the finch line

7651 :  fiftynine percent of them made arguments in terms of one of the more conservative moral values and just eight percent

7652 :  they increasingly wall themselves off in these ideological silos consuming different

7653 :  if they do if they find out they find each other less attractive and they more and more dont

7654 :  they dont want to befriend one another

7655 :  i cant change the past i cant change the fact that i was sexually abused as a child

7656 :  holding four year old sashas hand felt so good ive decided to direct a feature length

7657 :  i wanted to share my story with the world and push for a conversation that i felt our society was struggling to

7658 :  i resented the part of me that was in pain

7659 :  we are at a stage where well be making thousands of microscopes

7660 :  another fun fact is this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool

7661 :  we are starting at the end of the summer

7662 :  its called a microscope

7663 :  just to play the guitar

7664 :  i have a room at my place a room at my parents place

7665 :  as simple and as innocent as that

7666 :  i was like nothing

7667 :  what are you doing on monday and tuesday

7668 :  i really liked the kids but even more i liked that my plank was helping them

7669 :  they have every kind of therapist possibly imaginable

7670 :  in november i underwent surgery and spent a few weeks recovering

7671 :  apparently the plank is really popular in china

7672 :  now this doctor had never really been my doctor but he had always been there when my

7673 :  and i was like why

7674 :  the word itself says im possible

7675 :  i had never been on tv

7676 :  no one ever treated me like i was different and my parents always let me try whatever i wanted

7677 :  it became a show

7678 :  we gave this land back to nature

7679 :  it became a book

7680 :  this is measurable

7681 :  they had melted like snowballs on a hot stove

7682 :  and ten days after getting the krebiozen they were gone

7683 :  but i want to give you a few highlights about what this is all about

7684 :  so he dosed him up on a friday not expecting that mr

7685 :  he had tumors the size of oranges in his armpits neck chest abdomen

7686 :  its actually in their physiology

7687 :  i compiled them all into my upcoming book mind over medicine

7688 :  its not an easy process to go through alone so it makes a big difference if somebody else is holding that positive belief with you

7689 :  west just couldnt do that

7690 :  you can actually see what happens to the body

7691 :  your spiritual life matters

7692 :  wright time was really running out

7693 :  and then all those natural self repair mechanisms can come into play

7694 :  as doctors we think were being realistic you know

7695 :  i love the rogain studies

7696 :  so that might be creativity it might be family it might be invention adventure faith service it might be raising

7697 :  actually i kind of felt bulletproof because i knew that i had broken the spell and i had found my way back home to

7698 :  and it was only when i was trying to unthread that that i finally began to comprehend the strange and unlikely

7699 :  and thats how i pushed through it

7700 :  you got something to do with that whole eat pray love thing thats been going on lately

7701 :  i wrote all through childhood all through adolescence by the time i was a teenager i was sending my very bad stories to the new

7702 :  it is time to say no more

7703 :  i wanted the same opportunity as my two older brothers who left before me to come to the united

7704 :  she was so happy

7705 :  see i was desperate to leave iran

7706 :  dont tell me it was the norm

7707 :  dont get me wrong i have no aspirations to be the leader of a worldwide religion

7708 :  we like feeling strong

7709 :  parents among you will not be surprised to find out that on this particular day my son took about an hour and a half longer

7710 :  slowing down the body can help slow down the mind

7711 :  and after a while all those terrifying emotions just stopped being so terrifying and start being normal human

7712 :  it pushes people away

7713 :  that really came to head for me when my son was about three month old and i was home taking

7714 :  the tarahumara had a different strategy

7715 :  he pissed me off

7716 :  you show me a creature with webbed feet and gills somehow waters involved

7717 :  every other animal is stronger than we are they have fangs they have claws they have nimbleness they have

7718 :  we are here today

7719 :  someone with that kind of heart theres some kind of connection there

7720 :  well there are teams of scientists at harvard and the university of utah that are bending their brains and trying to figure

7721 :  theyre trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries

7722 :  they give you fortyeight hours to finish this race

7723 :  thats because an apache triathlon used to be youd run fifty miles across the desert engage in hand to hand combat

7724 :  wins the new york city marathon goes home with a big fat check

7725 :  if youre wondering why the tarahumara dont fight and dont die of heart disease why a poor ethiopian

7726 :  you cant be a pissed off pack

7727 :  we have our digital technology

7728 :  so we all know what to do in this situation right

7729 :  well how do we spoil anything

7730 :  for some reason you guys are just really slow

7731 :  and what you find is something the tarahumara have known for a very long time that this can be a whole lot of fun

7732 :  we try to cash in on it

7733 :  the mayans and aztecs engaged which is why there are very few mayans and aztecs

7734 :  you need to have those sixtyfour and sixtyfive year olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope youre trying to

7735 :  but maybe theres another benefit there as well

7736 :  we talked for two minutes backstage and she talked about plantar fasciitis

7737 :  you know we look at running as this kind of alien foreign thing this punishment youve got to do because you ate pizza the night before

7738 :  a couple years ago emily baer signed up for a race called the hardrock one hundred which tells you all you need to

7739 :  so what if we evolved as hunting pack animals

7740 :  number one is they have been living essentially unchanged for the past four hundred years

7741 :  again were talking about outliers theres got to be some kind of cause and effect

7742 :  what ive been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners people whove gotten rid

7743 :  they are free from all of these modern ailments

7744 :  but maybe its something different

7745 :  the pack stays together

7746 :  well if thats true a couple other things had to be true as well

7747 :  if you go out by yourself and try to chase an antelope i guarantee there will be two cadavers out in the savanna

7748 :  so you burn off the h agen dazs from the night before

7749 :  those expert trackers have to be part of the pack

7750 :  you take a runner like ann trason or nikki kimball or jenn shelton put them in a race of fifty or one hundred miles

7751 :  thanks very much

7752 :  maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal

7753 :  so if humans evolved as runners if thats our one natural advantage then why are we so bad at it

7754 :  but it aint doing both

7755 :  and youll get slower and slower until eventually youre back to running the same speed you were at age nineteen
7756 :  maybe theres something between what we are today and what the tarahumara have always been

7757 :  but the cool thing about running as ive discovered is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time

7758 :  shes thirtyseven years old

7759 :  so how do we get back to that again

7760 :  all of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day which was

7761 :  geronimo used to say my only friends are my legs

7762 :  its only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain

7763 :  were really good at being sweaty and smelly

7764 :  they took off and hid in this labyrinthine networking spider webbing

7765 :  and once again a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery perhaps the key to derartu tulu and the

7766 :  now this is when something really bizarre happens

7767 :  stop focusing on urban marathons which if you do four hours you suck and if you do

7768 :  and if we find that thing maybe there is a big fat nobel prize out there

7769 :  we think usain bolt is fast

7770 :  get rid of all the stinking running shoes

7771 :  ill give you an example

7772 :  to have a brain of that size you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy

7773 :  australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain

7774 :  we try to can it and package it and make it better and then sell it to people

7775 :  why you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s

7776 :  in other words early humans are eating dead animals no argument thats a fact

7777 :  the second thing remarkable about the tarahumara is deep into old age seventy to eighty years old

7778 :  what if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group

7779 :  so you have these three mysteries

7780 :  well i would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging all the sales all the marketing

7781 :  and then after that you succumb to the rigors of time

7782 :  the fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in four hundred and fifteen
7783 :  results dominate schools and schools dominate us the

7784 :  ive had some amazing experiences with amazing teachers who opened my eyes

7785 :  i asked her why do you think people feel like they need a relationship to be happy

7786 :  you can be in a relationship with anyone but it doesnt always mean theyre going to make you happy

7787 :  i want someone to love me and make me feel special

7788 :  thats about one third of chinas urban population in a weekend

7789 :  so how will you change the world

7790 :  what these apps all have in common is theyre taking previously invisible

7791 :  and weve seen our neighbors devastated by hundreds of wildfires

7792 :  my family had seen summer heat so intense that it split ancient oak trees

7793 :  so maybe we should be more like the professional athlete or we should be more like that tireless programmer or like that

7794 :  see today were all so afraid of that word failure but the truth is we need to fail

7795 :  we all know that imperfection exists all around us

7796 :  four billion dollar aircraft because the maintenance crew only did ninetynine percent of their job

7797 :  well typosquatting is where companies like google post advertisements on websites that are commonly miskeyed

7798 :  think about that

7799 :  stress is bad for us isnt it

7800 :  and you know what

7801 :  somebody had the highest gpa

7802 :  when did we come to live in a world where these types of typos common errors this do your best attitude or just good enough was

7803 :  i guarantee you it wasnt a seventytwo way tie

7804 :  but the world in a way is fighting back

7805 :  the sharyee is a southern wind that usually blows late april and late

7806 :  and why is that

7807 :  lets set iraq as an example as a benchmark for the neighboring countries and

7808 :  the beginning begins right

7809 :  but what about iraq

7810 :  we were drinking chai and we started talking about the future of this area

7811 :  most of the time its because of a dust storm episode happening in baghdad basrah or the

7812 :  so lets start with the right foot when it comes to environment

7813 :  i work with those people i see those people every single day and actually this was one of the reasons

7814 :  how is iraq affected by those changes

7815 :  and what about iraq

7816 :  but its a matter of scale

7817 :  is iraq an active part of this game or not

7818 :  at the forefront

7819 :  it involves social scientists so we know how to get not just seventy percent of the people to use the bed nets but

7820 :  but i im optimistic

7821 :  we need mathematicians to come in and simulate this to do monte carlo things to understand how these tools

7822 :  and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year

7823 :  that means that if the entire u

7824 :  but that alone doesnt give us the road map

7825 :  so every tool that weve ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective

7826 :  and those top twenty percent have been the best in the world if you measure them against the other top

7827 :  we need rich world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things

7828 :  and we have to change this

7829 :  its getting weaker

7830 :  if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way you do it vigorously you can

7831 :  everybody needs to be involved

7832 :  now the strength for those top twenty percent is starting to fade on a relative

7833 :  and the answer is no

7834 :  and so thats why the death rate did come down

7835 :  i think people are beginning to recognize how important this is and it really can

7836 :  theyre taking data the test scores and saying to a teacher hey you caused this amount of increase

7837 :  because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension

7838 :  theyre constantly improving their teachers

7839 :  and so kipp is doing it

7840 :  not only has that been weak

7841 :  so i wanted to become much better at it and learn anything i could

7842 :  gave it more love and care than my own child

7843 :  draw from it

7844 :  and its like a magnet

7845 :  she gave a wonderful example of michael corleone al pacinos character in the godfather and that probably his

7846 :  and its something that always drove all his choices

7847 :  sometimes its as simple as once upon a time

7848 :  and he orders a pint and they sit in silence for a while

7849 :  and woodys was to do what was best for his child

7850 :  and we got a hold of that fax

7851 :  but under that was this global tension of will we ever find nemo in this huge vast ocean

7852 :  youve gone through hundreds of tv channels just switching channel after channel and then suddenly you actually

7853 :  and when an artist does that to another artist its like youre compelled to pass it on

7854 :  so i researched everything i possibly could

7855 :  yet there was something more being said

7856 :  it doesnt always mean plot or fact

7857 :  everything lawrence did in that movie was an attempt for him to figure out where his place was in the world

7858 :  what exactly was it

7859 :  and it wasnt until on one of my later viewings that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where hes walked across the

7860 :  use what you know

7861 :  in the short term have you made me want to know what will happen next

7862 :  nazi leaders told the king to mark all jews with the star of david

7863 :  in fact i see the root of this type of celebration throughout history and around the world everyday

7864 :  imagine the curriculum in america based on the acceptance of all cultures in our nation and in the world

7865 :  what do you know about us

7866 :  tolerance is where we are and tolerance is the bar our society assessed its highest score

7867 :  its pretty simple the way it works

7868 :  climate change happens

7869 :  how is our climate changing

7870 :  i had a network of support

7871 :  ive had enough

7872 :  i know of a gay couple that went on their honey moon

7873 :  and its even more complicated than that

7874 :  life partner sounds very formal

7875 :  you cannot approach this podium together

7876 :  you must fill out separate forms

7877 :  i dont know how many times weve been in that same situation where we just dont take

7878 :  but we numb ourselves to it

7879 :  and when hate crimes are inflicted theyre usually the most violent category

7880 :  it was a great night

7881 :  were going to be reasonable people

7882 :  and the other thing i thought was im so relieved she wouldnt take my hand

7883 :  and i became really passionate about that about being an entrepreneur

7884 :  youve got too much information in there

7885 :  and when i got to oxford circus on the metro i got off the train to go to my

7886 :  whatever you attend to you form some representation not necessarily completely accurate but some

7887 :  these are all scenarios that you might not be able to leave your home

7888 :  would we have thrown him out then

7889 :  so we had one group that i hoped their performance would be very high another group that i thought their performance would be very low and

7890 :  i walked with him to his office

7891 :  where was this guilt trip coming from

7892 :  lets throw him out

7893 :  he was twenty some years older than anybody else in the sample

7894 :  and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us

7895 :  and i went to his deputy and asked him what was going on

7896 :  and im sure that its something that we all recognize and we see that it happens

7897 :  we have lasers we can whiten it out

7898 :  maybe we dont recognize it every time but we understand that it happens

7899 :  and yes while using the three paths lets not forget lets always keep in mind the basic principle that lies at their

7900 :  were up against a paradox again

7901 :  these guys are soft and chubby

7902 :  this is the boundary of what the book can be

7903 :  were going to make books so much more personal for you

7904 :  when they start using it they discover something right away

7905 :  that changes a tremendous amount

7906 :  are print books dead

7907 :  i think its going to be a pretty exciting time to be alive

7908 :  students see an explanation at their own time and pace

7909 :  theres on demand video for that

7910 :  we have the tools to do it

7911 :  whats variable is when and how long a student actually has to work on something and whats fixed is that they

7912 :  and so im pretty optimistic about it

7913 :  but now today its no longer impractical

7914 :  but what if that estimate is just based on your own experience in a non mastery framework your own experience with

7915 :  by the time they got to algebra they had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldnt engage with it

7916 :  and the answer is no

7917 :  but what if you want to see brush strokes

7918 :  its called collections

7919 :  and it took eighteen months

7920 :  you look at all those relationships damaged or destroyed because you were too busy being perfect to be

7921 :  i have won pretty much every fitness accolade that there is to win and i have even been on the back of a special k

7922 :  i share this with you not to brag but to let you know that even with all of that

7923 :  we also get to stretch the belief and knowledge of just how much we are capable of

7924 :  perfectionism comes in many colours but it speaks the language of black or white

7925 :  for a few this might be true

7926 :  if you are like me you might not realise you have this until it is too late

7927 :  perfectionists look to see how far they have got to go

7928 :  and we stopped trying to be perfectionists and as my teacher and thought leader tal ben shahar says

7929 :  perfectionists strive to be flawless they see their mistakes as a character flaw

7930 :  i just never knew when it was going to happen or where

7931 :  when the talk around town about my father being a drunk was no longer just gossip and i thought that everyone everywhere knew

7932 :  what would happen if we evolved our thinking

7933 :  its a weekly turnaround of production

7934 :  volunteers have value

7935 :  it really starts to rack up

7936 :  we just keep doing more laundry

7937 :  therere over three thousand county court houses around the country all of them with people sitting for hours mostly

7938 :  obviously theres a value to volunteering

7939 :  here we are talking about fractions

7940 :  look at the volunteering world

7941 :  and what is the math here

7942 :  if we are aware of that we can make the better decisions

7943 :  you dont want to do that right

7944 :  because taking one fifth makes us nervous

7945 :  if youre a family member caring for child or an aging parent youre producing something theres a value

7946 :  thats why its so admirable that sal khan at khan academy and david coleman at the college board are working to have

7947 :  if you have a job the market has put a value on that

7948 :  charities are happy to ask for our time to help them fund raise right

7949 :  its multiplying your time by the dollars per hour

7950 :  and sometimes with the best of intentions

7951 :  not even just to do well on this test but actually to learn the skills

7952 :  and in most cases the numbers are all out there waiting for us

7953 :  so how do we turn this around

7954 :  when you do the math you start to see how things pile up

7955 :  and i was stunned by what i found

7956 :  everybodys time is worth something

7957 :  but why dont we think about it

7958 :  and it turns out that that lack of awareness of numbers pervades all kinds of actions we take and

7959 :  and thats what was driving it

7960 :  and that is because we dont see how small numbers pile up into the big ones we dont see how small numbers

7961 :  we never possess some of that money to begin with so we dont have to hand it back

7962 :  theyre being read to sometimes ten thousand more hours because their parents know to do that and can afford to

7963 :  we dont sense how the numbers pile up

7964 :  the kids keep getting bigger and dirtier

7965 :  that fraction of a gallon is not the swing vote here

7966 :  fifty hours of test prep is not going to turn it around

7967 :  because thiss how we turn around society

7968 :  so whats the math we talk about here

7969 :  if you think you havent think of all the hands that didnt go up when i asked

7970 :  look at that

7971 :  i knew i had to quit

7972 :  she says so i went the next day

7973 :  and i havent spoken to you once in the four years since that day

7974 :  i knew i was where i was supposed to be i knew i was home

7975 :  and if you change one persons understanding of it understanding of what theyre capable of understanding of how much people care

7976 :  i was in line for registration and i looked around and just knew i couldnt do it i wasnt ready

7977 :  youre just one of the people who hasnt been told

7978 :  we love you no matter what

7979 :  it is that we are powerful beyond measure

7980 :  what is it you want to go and achieve

7981 :  and by admission they are also the ones that often fall flat on their face and fail

7982 :  were all just part of religions

7983 :  women are now allowed to pray in our church wide meetings and they never were before in the general conferences

7984 :  when i hear these arguments i still continue to bristle because i have family and friends

7985 :  im the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever

7986 :  you see if theres chemistry

7987 :  one time i asked a client

7988 :  here i am on my third date with my witty retorts a dress that left

7989 :  com just used one ad with a couple in a wheelchair one ad

7990 :  ive never dated someone asian before

7991 :  now lets look at the continuum in our society where sexuality is measured

7992 :  graphene will change the world

7993 :  and one evening i was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in kabul and he asked what i thought would be

7994 :  somebody has to feel how you felt

7995 :  and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children and i will

7996 :  yet there is hope

7997 :  so with that i will leave you

7998 :  how do we move forward from here

7999 :  people wrote and said please can i help

8000 :  because the whole point was to work with a simple agenda lets get equality in every aspect of our lives

8001 :  what we need is a seismic change in the global political landscape

8002 :  if you want to know what we did were giving it away

8003 :  i remember when my son was six he had a friend over to play

8004 :  in the end we succeeded

8005 :  and i have waited long enough

8006 :  all we had was a wonderful tight group of fabulous

8007 :  all i got were empty promises and disappointment enough disappointment to found a

8008 :  and when the men in the race saw how many votes we were attracting wonder of

8009 :  i love what i do but i love my kids more

8010 :  come on people lets activate

8011 :  two thousand and sixteen the un were looking for a brand new ambassador to represent womens

8012 :  can you imagine if we could mobilize millions of women across the world to

8013 :  they were in the next room i could hear them chatting

8014 :  because the fact is equality is better for everyone

8015 :  to the traditional battles of politics

8016 :  we wanted people from the left from the right from the middle every age group

8017 :  because heres the critical thing the one place women and men are absolutely equal is at the ballot

8018 :  i was like forget about it

8019 :  first week i was there i went to some party

8020 :  there was a little guy with white hair

8021 :  but you know i found out later that evening

8022 :  finally i got a fulbright sholarship to mit which is the reason i am standing here

8023 :  shed told me before why dont you try therapy

8024 :  when you have this trauma its like a soldier with post traumatic stress

8025 :  so me and my buddy who was my sparring partner got hired to do some special work at a rock

8026 :  so when a city also starts with leadership it starts at our executive directors it starts with our bosses it starts with

8027 :  we recognized that there is an issue downtown on martin luther king boulevard on one side

8028 :  what if we create a culture of selflessness

8029 :  and then how can you market this app to that audience

8030 :  i noticed a trend

8031 :  this phenomenon was detected by the u

8032 :  he translated the acoustic radiance of the whales voice its song into a

8033 :  we had to come up with a slut name which the older students encouraged us to write across our breasts

8034 :  no means no

8035 :  upon arriving at each bar an older student would shout out a word which was code for us to either flash

8036 :  so why does all this matter

8037 :  we can speak up about consent and try to offset some of these normalized assumptions

8038 :  were having a bit of harmless banter

8039 :  it felt like fancy dress for the boys meant something fun meant dressing up in a whole variety of different ways

8040 :  our group bumped into the mens rugby club in a bar

8041 :  the whole thing culminated in the girls and guys meeting up in the student union where we were informed the older students had organized a

8042 :  there was also a lot of evidence in what we were hearing to suggest that this kind of sexual objectification carried over

8043 :  a long line of girls was lined up and they had to take their clothes off they were told to race to strip

8044 :  but why should it be a requirement

8045 :  was i dressed sluttily

8046 :  it ruined my freshers week and left me feeling isolated and humiliated

8047 :  im afraid these attitudes that we thought were ebbing away are coming back with force

8048 :  with one email

8049 :  doesnt matter if its someone you know if its late or if youre drunk

8050 :  i had some great support from my family and some great therapy

8051 :  at another it was called sharking at another it was simply called fuck a fresher

8052 :  he was calling me a slag a slut and a whore

8053 :  we have to start now

8054 :  i didnt realize what we were going to do as we were facing the other way when they suddenly shouted down it bitch

8055 :  so what can you do to play your part

8056 :  so we have to speak up and our voices are loudest when we raise them together

8057 :  in fact many penguins are starving and the primary culprits are climate change and

8058 :  sadly several recent oil spills have harmed penguins

8059 :  initially governmental red tape kept wildlife rescuers from going to tristan but eventually a small team

8060 :  my favorite account was from an unschooling mom her name is jennifer

8061 :  the most recent china led aiib bank which in us is absent and the us led tpp which in

8062 :  with the joint efforts this project may help to solve the pressing clean water issues in china while

8063 :  when china was trying to innovate its made in china products there was concern in america whether there is a rising

8064 :  while i was enjoying my classes at harvard yard i was also amazed by the hot debate about how china will

8065 :  it is a journey of how us and china will continue to explore shared opportunities and

8066 :  it is a journey of how china would advance through integration through the world community

8067 :  while i was climbing the empire state building i was also amazed that the skyscrapers nearby are

8068 :  i was imagining that i can sit in a class at harvard yard i can climb on top of the empire state building i can

8069 :  some are easy

8070 :  one pile becomes ten piles and then your boss is coming in or you have friends coming over for dinner and you push them

8071 :  you open it open it but youre not making decisions

8072 :  we pick something up we put it back down

8073 :  the closets that are overflowing the garages that cant hold cars the storage units that have become

8074 :  i was the model patient

8075 :  i had a valve defect that id had my whole life and i had been told youll live into

8076 :  and she said you keep telling me about ideas that you have for your business and things you want to

8077 :  some clutter is going to come back both the physical kind the emotional kind thats called life its going to keep coming

8078 :  and perhaps the postponed decision is

8079 :  from books to tv shows to magazines you cant even check out at the grocery store without seeing the word

8080 :  now it has to have an action just like with the physical stuff

8081 :  shes an inspiration

8082 :  the unconscious bias is there but we just have to look at how we can move past it

8083 :  and if we want to create a world where the circumstances of your birth dont matter we all have to be part of the solution

8084 :  and look we all do it

8085 :  lets open our hearts and our minds lets open our ears and our mouths and lets

8086 :  mind you my teenage self bristled at such a suggestion because i had it all figured out on my own

8087 :  but perhaps the most memorable meeting i had out of all of these was when i found myself

8088 :  i think by any measure it absolutely is

8089 :  ant thats the concept i have in my mind

8090 :  thats critically important

8091 :  so i think its important to know that yeah it started with marketing but it became a reality

8092 :  its important for people that want to grow their companies

8093 :  and ill leave you with a quote

8094 :  when i look forward twenty years

8095 :  and i think its important to understand what is silicon valley at least in my context

8096 :  patents are around the legal protection of intellectual property

8097 :  ill give you three examples of what that means from my perspective

8098 :  and so as the water cycles depicted in this slide largely speaking the water evaporates it goes into the

8099 :  and its understandable i think its human nature

8100 :  and i think some of the elements well talk about but i think that one important thing to note is that it

8101 :  we had no money it was just an idea

8102 :  talent likes to be there

8103 :  i think were there

8104 :  because we already had some critical mass but as we take that forward why is that even important why is that relevant

8105 :  build a community

8106 :  you cant have one without the other

8107 :  if we could break some international rankings that would be great as well but we can work step by step

8108 :  i work for a multinational company

8109 :  and in fact it was largely free

8110 :  and remember that the competition is not warsaw or wroclaw as a previous speaker said

8111 :  well most people in a monologue will say beware

8112 :  what you dont see here is what happened a few months later in the financial collapse of two thousand and eight when the market

8113 :  whats the point about worrying about something that might happen

8114 :  this is an image from a study that we conducted led by phd student micah edelson and what its

8115 :  and the third principle is progress monitoring

8116 :  so what do we see

8117 :  and so the question is why

8118 :  we all know that

8119 :  what is the likelihood that you will suffer hearing loss in your future

8120 :  and it doesnt work

8121 :  let me explain

8122 :  for example you might tell yourself

8123 :  its one of the principles of what the brain is actually doing

8124 :  it means that if youre trying to get peoples attention you might want to highlight the progress

8125 :  and its not just us

8126 :  so in a hospital here in the united states a camera was installed to see how often medical staff

8127 :  and how was it doing it

8128 :  let me show you

8129 :  is just going to get worse and worse and worse

8130 :  he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki

8131 :  maybe theres a little change i can get involved in

8132 :  and that was when i had the idea

8133 :  and i remember the first letter

8134 :  and it was eight hundred am when i stood there

8135 :  one of the first letters was from the dalai lama

8136 :  we had to wait now and see what happened

8137 :  that was an incredible moment

8138 :  i said what would you do

8139 :  and i went back to the u

8140 :  i was living at my moms place

8141 :  i was with brahimi ambassador brahimi

8142 :  there was no starting point for peace

8143 :  and very quickly some letters started coming back

8144 :  so he was like my hero

8145 :  i think theres a number of pillars to success

8146 :  its about your constituencies its about your businesses

8147 :  i dont know how to get involved in that process

8148 :  its all about the individuals

8149 :  i think the camera is

8150 :  why dont we bring truce to life

8151 :  and then we went home

8152 :  this must be created

8153 :  and i was waiting for him to come down and i knew that he was on his way

8154 :  kofi annan said this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground

8155 :  ultimately thats what its about

8156 :  is this possible

8157 :  its all about partnerships

8158 :  why dont you support the process of the largest ever global truce

8159 :  i decided that id continue filming and make another movie

8160 :  in fact so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit i

8161 :  its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold

8162 :  he talked about the glories of failure

8163 :  it stopped moving

8164 :  and that is that when we lower the oxygen concentration further by one hundred times to ten parts per

8165 :  well we had a lot of them

8166 :  everest and they can sit there for hours and theres no problem

8167 :  the researchers had to suit up just to enter it

8168 :  so then theres also my favorite example of suspended animation

8169 :  giuliani shrunk that time frame so that crime statistics would be collected on a daily even

8170 :  and so what we need to do is think about how can we change that dynamic

8171 :  and using this they evaluated over a thousand federal programs

8172 :  lets replace a focus on partisan division with a focus on

8173 :  that is the path to a better future for us all

8174 :  now why is that story and that approach so novel

8175 :  and a funny thing happened when we did that

8176 :  but unfortunately there wasnt ever a well publicized increase in funding for those programs that did

8177 :  over one hundred and fifty programs had their funding reduced because they could not demonstrate

8178 :  the greenwood section of our city was known as black wall street

8179 :  i was running against a two term incumbent and my opponent ran the classic partisan

8180 :  well omalley loved that approach and he applied it in baltimore

8181 :  and i am using this approach in tulsa

8182 :  and i was the underdog

8183 :  what weve found is actually quite the opposite

8184 :  at the dawn of the 1920s tulsa was home to the most vibrant african american community in the country

8185 :  life has been kind

8186 :  five on his farm

8187 :  so the way wes has put this is that we are simply stopovers between soil and soil

8188 :  and then when you go back to planting food crop again you incorporate that into the soil and put

8189 :  and in the first place the first thing to understand is that soil is not dirt

8190 :  shed never made a costume

8191 :  she was afraid she couldnt do it

8192 :  shed never been to a convention before

8193 :  what ive just described to you is what cosplay is

8194 :  dont let that positivity end with you

8195 :  see it as a challenge because you can do anything

8196 :  they sit down at the piano and they play a song

8197 :  ill share a story with you

8198 :  and for me space is that white area left on that map its the place we still have

8199 :  i mean really how did my grandmother who grew up in a village in a country that would become turkey know of

8200 :  it worked because of a powerful narrative we can name it the american dream

8201 :  it also worked because of the power of narrative

8202 :  but theyre not exactly democratically perfect examples of crowdsourcing either

8203 :  they suppress some voices and they elevate others

8204 :  you know what he said

8205 :  and she said the following

8206 :  they tell us who we are the meaning of whats happening around us where we came from and they give us some guidance

8207 :  those stories that are so big that we live inside them

8208 :  so we need a new story

8209 :  what should we do when that place that we call the west and that place that we call islam cant

8210 :  and i swear the first thing well do when we go to america is well start to work and well pay

8211 :  the other reason we need stories that offer us a choice is because when we have hard problems or

8212 :  there are lots of stories lots of ways of thinking lots of codes lots of symbols and theyre all

8213 :  they actually had already been told that they could take the two hundred and fifty which they had been allowed to take with them from

8214 :  and we dont really buy stories anymore in which we are told the end and what were supposed to sort of leave out

8215 :  my grandmother was not my grandfathers first choice in marriage

8216 :  the same thing three things that all successful societal narratives have

8217 :  what do you do when the european union which was a shared dream cant figure out how to

8218 :  but this is no ordinary well

8219 :  its very very frustrating and i was feeling left out like i wasnt quite gay enough

8220 :  its a wonderful day in our countrys history its a wonderful day in the globes history to be able to have an actual sitting

8221 :  he was in a movie called torch song trilogy

8222 :  and then he reaches into his pocket and he brings this out to me

8223 :  i realized there were a lot of people who werent as gay as i was gay being happy not gay being attracted to the same sex

8224 :  i wouldnt have been so confused i wouldnt have been so upset

8225 :  and i said to myself lz for so long you have been denied this

8226 :  ill watch this

8227 :  love and respect thats what the whole film was about

8228 :  and then the little boy said to me what are you writing

8229 :  but actually why was i going to tedx

8230 :  was it one thing in particular

8231 :  the doctor on the phone said theres one problem

8232 :  and then the doctor said to me but theres something you need to know

8233 :  and i thought well what am i interested in

8234 :  i said yes thatd be really nice

8235 :  was it one lecture

8236 :  why did you come

8237 :  and we did a surgery and he went home with three weeks of age parents were delighted everything was a success

8238 :  and he wrote back and said so what are you speaking on

8239 :  and thats pretty inspirational i have to say

8240 :  and thats what i believe inspiration does for us

8241 :  what would you like to speak on

8242 :  now it may be sunsets it may be a sporting hero it may be a piece of music it

8243 :  and the first thing we do when we come across a victim of trauma is we assess them for breathing

8244 :  and prepare we did

8245 :  i mean this is pretty simple right

8246 :  find one that makes sense for who you are

8247 :  you bite the bullet because you have to

8248 :  and ninetynine thousand people die every year because of hospital based infections

8249 :  and they are right next to you

8250 :  and i think it is tough

8251 :  so i have got my metal album i have got my 3d animation and graphic design going i have

8252 :  this does not have to be your belt buckle

8253 :  they do not have the tools to be successful

8254 :  and you are interacting with them

8255 :  we prepared so hard

8256 :  and i think it is on the other side as well

8257 :  for me the belt buckle is a motto

8258 :  let us treat them with respect

8259 :  and then it became a button with more buttons

8260 :  we had to go out we had to get some perspective

8261 :  i know deep down in your heart you know whats right

8262 :  anger as iraqi lawyers like samira saleh al naimi have been tortured and executed by isis for

8263 :  has the west stood with them

8264 :  and we must be

8265 :  seventeen years after her daughters throat was cut in the street she told her surviving daughters that she was

8266 :  i have no pretensions to be a poet

8267 :  we are hope

8268 :  instead they watched the united states and britain support the archaic gulf monarchies that exported

8269 :  so how about other things

8270 :  i told you i was weird

8271 :  which felt extraordinarily correct

8272 :  and i chose the sciences

8273 :  because of his research i traveled the world a lot and i kept moving school and country

8274 :  will come and it develops and develops and its getting better and better

8275 :  is that cool

8276 :  he sold me to the most violent gang in columbus ohio

8277 :  that encouraged me and empowered me to the point where i wanted to

8278 :  i am always right behind you

8279 :  it will be defined by my willingness to give back more than i take

8280 :  my life will not be defined by the bad choices that ive made or could make

8281 :  realize that life is short and too precious to squander

8282 :  when he puts his mind to it

8283 :  and there are learning high level computer programming languages

8284 :  i broke it again i got to restore it

8285 :  a garden plot that he had planted that he had taken care of and at the same time he was learning botany and

8286 :  it was really frustrating for him

8287 :  well we found out that it wasnt working

8288 :  everbody would start at the same time and theyd end at the same time

8289 :  and these are all using technologies that exist now

8290 :  because no one child can move a six foot long lincoln log

8291 :  they look like theyre having fun

8292 :  let us all work our own path towards how we want the world to be

8293 :  if youre uncomfortable with closing your eyes thats fine

8294 :  how should i live

8295 :  and we can steer our personal lives to its goal that we want and that is in harmony with who we

8296 :  and that separation has brought feelings and thoughts of unworthiness

8297 :  what did you do when you were a child

8298 :  who am i to change the world

8299 :  at that moment i made a decision

8300 :  relax your face

8301 :  firstly we should have more female role models who code because by having more female role models who code girls can see

8302 :  secondly we should have a more nurturing environment for women to learn in the tech industry because right now there is a lot of sexism

8303 :  how can we get a world where fifty of all coding jobs are held by women instead of only twentyseven
8304 :  people were freaking out

8305 :  so i worked my way into the middle of the crowd and lying there for everyone to see was an unwrapped unused

8306 :  a bunch of my grademates and classmates were circled around this one thing and i didnt know what it was but i really wanted to find out

8307 :  i didnt want to look the cashier in the eye and i didnt want anyone to see me with the box on my way home from the store

8308 :  for example it was not only students but also teachers who did not feel motivated

8309 :  so important was this that in fact the success was covered in the new york times in a front page article a few weeks later

8310 :  for example these four algorithms were all built by the same guy

8311 :  now programming for those of you here that havent done it yourself requires laying out in

8312 :  about eight years ago we as a family met with an accident while at big bear lake in california

8313 :  so all i can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you wont notice

8314 :  davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera

8315 :  and when i spoke to benazir before she went back she told me about all the assassination threats

8316 :  but within a minute there was a much bigger blast and then there was orange flame everywhere and then

8317 :  in fact she had a huge impact on my career

8318 :  the third thing is

8319 :  although obviously i made sure that i could donate or recycle as much as i could the essence was about it leaving my

8320 :  one of the things i did was set myself challenges

8321 :  how why and where it went to was of less importance to me

8322 :  so i had this weird mixture of values which were basically like i need to keep hold of everything i have but equally i need to

8323 :  actually i can remember more of the things ive given away than the things that ive kept so for me thats a really important

8324 :  that helped me to be a little bit more ruthless when i was going through things

8325 :  so it started me thinking about a project to get rid of one thousand things

8326 :  i didnt have to think about things

8327 :  i had all of those things

8328 :  but what i didnt really do is think about the day to day things the things i brought into my house or took out of my house all the

8329 :  i seriously thought that i would not live till twenty
8330 :  so when i was fifteen i quit school

8331 :  could we possibly even turn it into a false memory

8332 :  but memory is not

8333 :  it turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory and then the brain will

8334 :  as simple as that

8335 :  do i say hi

8336 :  so what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with

8337 :  so whenever a memory is being formed any active cells for that memory will also have this

8338 :  now one dude in lab was even able to reactivate memories of female mice in male mice which rumor has it is a pleasurable

8339 :  now i even see a world where editing memories is something of a reality because were living in a time where its possible to pluck questions from

8340 :  first you find and label a memory in the brain and then you activate it with a

8341 :  so far what weve told you is basically we can control this play button of the clip so that we can play this video

8342 :  could we jump start that memory back to life maybe even play with the contents of that memory

8343 :  were just trying to connect the two

8344 :  that wouldnt stop my grandparents from trying to give him a meaningful life even though there werent

8345 :  within the next twenty years thirty thousand more future residents will outlive their parents their primary

8346 :  you can imagine packing red blue and green chromatophores together and expanding and contracting those to produce any

8347 :  it moved very quickly and it had hard parts to tear animals apart

8348 :  life suddenly became complex

8349 :  and in fact they did

8350 :  so theyd evolved to be very very efficient

8351 :  its a very efficient light

8352 :  the effect on the eye

8353 :  so unfortunately i cant reveal exactly the plans that i have next

8354 :  and we still dont fully understand how our images of the world are put together

8355 :  in fact those that are used for courtship those in areas of the plumage used to attract a female theyve

8356 :  it exists only in the minds of animals with eyes

8357 :  so its not just incidental of a yellow pigment

8358 :  what can i do

8359 :  the sea level is rising and there is very little room for these habitats to retreat to

8360 :  a warmer climate means these storms are becoming more intense and more long lived

8361 :  our coastlines theyre our favorite place to live weve destroyed a lot of these habitats

8362 :  it is causing cases of cholera to rise

8363 :  and what is a child

8364 :  except in one category

8365 :  and as addiction always does over the course of the next decade my tolerance continued to build my life continued

8366 :  the ethical dilemma immediately became do i issue this person narcotics in order to keep them happy or deny them and

8367 :  i had no idea of what these medications were even supposed to do

8368 :  addiction is the only disease where we commonly wait until its at the highest levels of acuity before we try to do

8369 :  emotional pain is toxic its pervasive and society has programmed us to avoid it

8370 :  but my understanding of pain that day was nothing like my understanding of pain today

8371 :  but my emotional pain was an absolute ten

8372 :  all i knew at age seventeen was that a lot of highly educated people had prescribed me medications that were intended to make me feel

8373 :  this data is appalling to me

8374 :  but now imagine sustaining that exact same injury only this time your close friend was skiing next to you

8375 :  i was confused

8376 :  im betting you can point to an element of unaddressed or unresolved emotional pain in that person

8377 :  but achieving post traumatic growth requires that you lean into the pain

8378 :  every time this happens were becoming more and more desensitized

8379 :  in recovery we often say you keep what you have by giving it away

8380 :  with short term pain management most would make a full recovery

8381 :  what can i do

8382 :  jane foster someone we already knew

8383 :  so how do we make it continue

8384 :  so what happens when the heroes in your myths dont look anything like you

8385 :  and thats the exciting thing

8386 :  i do not fear an artificial intelligence in the hand of a lone wolf

8387 :  how shall i best organize society when the need for human labor diminishes

8388 :  we teach them

8389 :  can we build systems that recognize objects identify emotions emote themselves play games and even

8390 :  how might i use computing to help take us to the stars

8391 :  how might i extend and enhance human life through cognitive healthcare

8392 :  we dont program them

8393 :  now there are a lot of pieces of dr

8394 :  im not building a hal

8395 :  if you just do everything according to your preferences its not going to always work

8396 :  now i think its helpful to know about personality type for two reasons

8397 :  you probably have already figured it out

8398 :  but that doesnt excuse yourself from trying

8399 :  they become aware of how is this going to impact people

8400 :  i mentioned i do some training programs and as part of that training i would typically

8401 :  this hand represents completing the project

8402 :  so try crossing them in the other way

8403 :  just try that with me if you would okay

8404 :  so personality type has been enourmously helpful to me in understanding myself and others

8405 :  we believe that you have both within you

8406 :  i can assure you were all just fine today

8407 :  im glad you got that

8408 :  its a compliment

8409 :  you have a natural preference for how you cross your arms

8410 :  so you can imagine what happens when we go to a chinese restaurant

8411 :  are they listening to me

8412 :  our memories are just fine

8413 :  theres a lot more to it than im going to get to today

8414 :  the only trick is we have to use an n for intuition because weve already used the i up for

8415 :  they just do it in different ways

8416 :  i think im working for an idiot

8417 :  they have no sense of standards and what is good work

8418 :  someone came up with them for me

8419 :  interruptions for extroverts actually may be compliments

8420 :  yours is going to be the myers briggs

8421 :  but suddenly with personality type she had a framework to understand what was happening

8422 :  in the age of wonderment that is my question that in the 21st century why are we allowing

8423 :  everything was fine because thats when i was getting my thrills my adrenaline ups highs lows

8424 :  so when the police came she said she fell when she was trying to run away

8425 :  if you think you cannot make a difference that amp x27 s wrong

8426 :  but symbolically what happened

8427 :  she thought she was going as a nanny she turned out to be a domestic slave

8428 :  the i ten corridor from el paso to houston is the largest corridor for human trafficking

8429 :  she got sold from one family to another then another woman started making her short skirts and things like

8430 :  and that couldnt happen because the parents would have a hard time accepting that this was your ticket to freedom to

8431 :  beirut bosnia somalia baghdad the works

8432 :  she fought the system and made sure that he had a safe home here

8433 :  and what happens some of these are just simple disputes where people leave home

8434 :  we cannot even begin to start to tell you the stories because they are so horrific but in these clips you might just get an idea

8435 :  all of us can really make a difference

8436 :  and the same story is repeated not just the church

8437 :  they want your money they will listen

8438 :  so we co produced with the help of an organization called amp quot end human trafficking now amp quot a six part series for the

8439 :  that amp x27 s far more than the slaves that were transported out of africa over a period of four hundred years

8440 :  he was the powerful one

8441 :  ask them and they will listen

8442 :  you can call hotlines that are set up

8443 :  they are in the a capella voice choir

8444 :  so in that way the kids were forced to work incredible hours no breaks no nothing

8445 :  but it isn amp x27 t safe for everybody

8446 :  we can ask the right questions ask people who make our garments are these garments

8447 :  and all of this can make a difference

8448 :  for all you know you may be sitting amongst people who have been trafficked before and you would not even know it

8449 :  her owner went scot free

8450 :  a lot of the kids that went back because they couldnt cope with all of this when there was alcoholism or drugs or violence

8451 :  it exists in a big way

8452 :  as a result that owner and i wont say employer it was the owner pushed her off the third floor

8453 :  it is even ahead of drugs

8454 :  much closer to home we saw this lady from the human trafficking unit in mexico

8455 :  we had our crews cover some raids where the police actually freed some of these kids

8456 :  so many people are sold into slavery by people in whom they have placed trust

8457 :  and as she is falling you can imagine whats going through her mind

8458 :  and somebody befriends them becomes a boyfriend makes them feel good

8459 :  shes trying to tell us and she is saying i look down and i say how do i rotate myself what do i do

8460 :  because the owner pretended to the police that this woman was trying to run away she packed all the clothes in bags and put them out

8461 :  there are at least twentyseven million slaves in this world today twentyseven million

8462 :  ask the chocolate manufacturers is this slave labor child labor from west africa

8463 :  we look at the boy in india

8464 :  we can make a difference

8465 :  here we saw what happened

8466 :  a guy whos got a girl and a boy cousins and hes selling them very happy very happy to sell them to our

8467 :  vision is one of the best things we do

8468 :  so you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy

8469 :  not yours of course other peoples

8470 :  you know we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions

8471 :  how much do you care about people

8472 :  and if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision which were so good at what are the chances we wont make

8473 :  and its so complex that we dont know what to do

8474 :  its not because we dont care

8475 :  we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat

8476 :  this is why we have these four minute dates

8477 :  lets go for hip replacement

8478 :  i was quite excited about this

8479 :  its like having your car stolen

8480 :  the general idea here by the way is that we actually dont know our preferences that well

8481 :  its not because its trivial

8482 :  because i feel like we as human beings have a right to products that are safe for our homes and our bodies

8483 :  well at the same time i was still running my blog

8484 :  i only have what i really need

8485 :  the second was product packaging and so i learned how to make all of my own products

8486 :  now zero waste thats a pretty big idea

8487 :  its caused by our fears

8488 :  and what about the waste

8489 :  i mean we went to india and asked about the nuclear program

8490 :  say we want to get to one hundred gigawatts by two thousand and twentytwo
8491 :  that will save money and time

8492 :  decide to go get a weapon

8493 :  we were there with mit and uc berkeley engineers

8494 :  we dont have backup we dont have all the natural gas

8495 :  i totally want to bring her home with us

8496 :  oh babe you look so hot tonight

8497 :  so monogamish what might this look like

8498 :  we all have our limits

8499 :  so i might as well divulge some info

8500 :  while making the book we took great care that none of the illustrations were objectionable in any way

8501 :  thats what we wanted

8502 :  during my years of work in this field i have even come across stories where girls have to eat and wash their dishes

8503 :  but in india only twelve percent of girls and women have access to hygienic ways of managing

8504 :  we all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run

8505 :  it was advertisement

8506 :  real fast she goes i am going to miss you

8507 :  now she is like me

8508 :  helping a friend have something to put on their applications for college

8509 :  senior year of high school

8510 :  they bring up microcatheters so that theres support and they try to navigate

8511 :  lets be slackers

8512 :  but then when we started playing around and talking to each other the different perspectives helped us to make

8513 :  you cant control your way to innovation

8514 :  lets give up

8515 :  that solution might have taken the form of a piece of imaging software or it might have taken the form of a medical

8516 :  i find that in order to get unstuck i first have to get out of my head

8517 :  alright so what do we know

8518 :  because in the beginning we were all getting cranky when we were getting into analysis paralysis mode

8519 :  and what we need to do is we need to forget ourselves and we need to focus on learning as much as we possibly can

8520 :  every time you get stressed out we get close to a deadline you want to bail

8521 :  and here is what those are

8522 :  i know youre all excited about this

8523 :  and people that are having fun think better

8524 :  we were charged with coming up with a solution that was going to improve this procedure as well as improve

8525 :  and to get unstuck i remember the reverse pac man and the lessons i learned from it

8526 :  pac man is saving lives

8527 :  because you all acknowledged in the beginning that you get stuck sometimes

8528 :  and the reality is is your ego gets all in the mix

8529 :  and for some it was to bridge the gap between the older and the younger generation which by the way is something that many faiths

8530 :  weve proven that the human family can come together and send a message far brighter and more

8531 :  our sense of isolation grows because our imagination goes into overdrive about the people and the

8532 :  municipal government officials stepped forward and helped with permits and with convening civil society

8533 :  and then from that point on it wasnt very hard for me to find insecure environments to work in because the world was

8534 :  thats not true either

8535 :  it was a pretty tame uncontroversial video or so

8536 :  the second is that families are not allowed to be involved that a funeral director has to

8537 :  you got your grandpas corpse in your house

8538 :  in jewish culture its the shemira respectfully guarding the dead from the time of death until theyre

8539 :  in fact what humans have been doing for thousands of years

8540 :  in the west we have never had quite this close a relationship with death and im not suggesting that

8541 :  my position there was going to be not only cremating the dead but also preparing the

8542 :  i have a playing card in my hand

8543 :  it was a spade

8544 :  he said it could be a high spade or a low spade

8545 :  my answer was

8546 :  things can always change

8547 :  and my answer was

8548 :  the ten of hearts

8549 :  but it was really fair

8550 :  not only that if instead of using my hand with the fingers i use my hand closed into a fist that makes this

8551 :  what is the second number

8552 :  he was nine years old

8553 :  this is the magic of ballroom dancing

8554 :  the study at the einstein medical college said ballroom dancing two or three times a week

8555 :  you sit up straighter you feel positive and confident and you send out with your body language and your posture

8556 :  you might ask

8557 :  now being palestinian meant we were uprooted from our home in one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight for the creation of the state

8558 :  asking these ladies and gentlemen these boys and girls to dance together ballroom style

8559 :  this was the hardest project i have ever ever done yet the most

8560 :  when i call you ladies and gentlemen you feel differently about yourself

8561 :  there are so many other similar stories but ballroom dancing isnt only for children

8562 :  einstein said i fear the day when technology takes over our human interaction

8563 :  i returned to jaffa and i worked with jewish and palestinian

8564 :  seoul keeps the lonely locked away in fast food ice cubes and the proper cum dumpsters

8565 :  high fructose corn syrup is my boyfriend

8566 :  the korean word for sweet is

8567 :  let us swig our gatorade sweeter

8568 :  pop goes the face shop

8569 :  the korean word for the game of death is

8570 :  time is running out

8571 :  we have worn down our jaws chewing barley for centuries now let us eat

8572 :  that is once they re cut up boot camped and reupholstered then record five track albums

8573 :  where singers are called idols

8574 :  and so we started looking at what are the effects of cooperative game play

8575 :  so we brought students into the lab we had them fill out a number of scales and then they came in a week later and played the game for an

8576 :  gravitational waves are ripples in the curvature of space time

8577 :  im amazed when a shooting star streaks across the sky

8578 :  it breaks down the fundamentals the critical actions a team needs to go through when a woman comes in in

8579 :  and perlman returned my phone call

8580 :  what we should be saying as a society to parents who are considering divorce is we just dont know

8581 :  then well test your kids every year to see how theyre doing

8582 :  but i dont want you around if youre going to be miserable

8583 :  the fact that our society tries so hard to have it both ways is a perfect example of a

8584 :  we all absorb these social narratives from an early age and we hardly ever question them

8585 :  yes my love is real

8586 :  and if i was a t

8587 :  thank you very much

8588 :  and if youre having a number problem i feel bad for you son

8589 :  the thing with dinosaurs is dinosaurs are kind of awesome more than that they actually existed

8590 :  like if youre with a dinosaur everything else seems secondary

8591 :  im break it down for the pi solo like three
8592 :  this aint no damsel in distress trapped princess dragon slaying quest because one dragons never happened two most

8593 :  yes i dont know what you take me as as the intelligence that hb has but from fractions to decimals i aint dumb

8594 :  we need physical action

8595 :  they always talk about a day when someone made their day better

8596 :  i didnt ask you for anything much

8597 :  thats that intimate moment between two strangers

8598 :  im not trying to sell you insurance

8599 :  they never talk about money

8600 :  i dont like change

8601 :  i dont know what happens next

8602 :  im just asking for a tiny bit

8603 :  we need things to be better

8604 :  im not talking about the time of the year when everyone else cares

8605 :  if i were to ask anyone in this room when you got that car that raise when you bought that house when you got that new

8606 :  seven million of these have made their way to a one hundred and twentythree countries with no marketing no advertising

8607 :  i want simple little tiny things

8608 :  i dont have an ulterior motive

8609 :  im a mamas boy

8610 :  pass on the bracelet

8611 :  thats the reason one
8612 :  its a level paying field

8613 :  no one is feeling like a charity case

8614 :  and it wont be in a history book it will be an ipad seventeen or some type of a holographic page that your kids kids will talk about

8615 :  we are connecting them to the endless possibilities associated with technology

8616 :  i ask people

8617 :  and i said well you know im just kind of kicking back blah blah blah blah blah

8618 :  thank you all very much

8619 :  besides the governments the best philanthropy its the biggest philanthropy in the world

8620 :  federal income tax

8621 :  were a little band but we get a lot of help in a lot of different ways

8622 :  shed been very busy with our philanthropic stuff over the last seven or eight years and she said why dont you come

8623 :  if you wanted to understand really the sources and drivers of profitability

8624 :  what would that look like

8625 :  i was hoping i could find something like a ten k document that the securities and exchange

8626 :  to try to try out some of the ideas

8627 :  infrastructure expenditure is much in the public eye actually with pretty

8628 :  she said okay youve left microsoft

8629 :  theres over ninety thousand independent government jurisdictions in the united states

8630 :  maybe even in the worst case in school numbers were something that you memorized for some purpose some

8631 :  thats a question by the numbers you can answer that is an outcome

8632 :  now i dont think old tom brady uses the same kind of tool i use which are numbers

8633 :  i didnt know when i started this

8634 :  we dont want this private shadow somebody will worry about the source being a d or an r or a blah

8635 :  and thats just at the federal level

8636 :  what about philanthropy and civic activism as opposed to running a basketball team and paying taxes

8637 :  who built the road in front of your house

8638 :  that was the judgment that she felt from people when she would be outside smoking a cigarette

8639 :  so here is the secret to self control

8640 :  so what this exercise did is it gave me a little bit of space between me and my thoughts

8641 :  now to understand why i was blown away you have to understand the world i live in

8642 :  the secret to self control is to give up control

8643 :  very very encouraging

8644 :  its a broad approach to behavior change thats being used to help people with anxiety disorders with

8645 :  its a story about courage about a man name benaiah who chased a lion down into a pit

8646 :  i hope its a story im reading for many years to come

8647 :  but my bookshelves told a rather different story

8648 :  my panamanian read for example came through a conversation i had with the panama canal on twitter

8649 :  then it was friends of friends

8650 :  so for example although well over one hundred books are translated from french and published in the uk each

8651 :  but it can also be really enlightening

8652 :  and when i thought about it it seemed like a real shame

8653 :  i couldnt tell you how to source a story from swaziland

8654 :  although the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher

8655 :  you may be asking yourself

8656 :  but despite all of my effort i just couldnt keep the balls in the air for more than eight

8657 :  i actually started first grade with a big cast all over my torso

8658 :  and your body somehow knows that

8659 :  and you go my god its really far away and its a giant waterfall

8660 :  anyway i can recall remembering thinking that they knew nothing about how this whole custom of black men dressing and

8661 :  however the importance of music within the body of culture is undeniable

8662 :  and i dont knows

8663 :  and for those of us who do understand our actions might not necessarily reflect that understanding

8664 :  i mean take the question of east asia

8665 :  it divided and its remained divided ever since

8666 :  it s really helping her to start her new life

8667 :  this was a tragic yet very hopeful story a story that has inspired so many

8668 :  i am writing a book about her story

8669 :  one after the other these kind of stories private companies coming in to provide food

8670 :  and i am not talking about a flattening of cultures religion and all that and languages

8671 :  she s now been resettled with her family to sweden and she is putting it towards her education

8672 :  and one of the fellow speakers at the conference last year alexis

8673 :  we are seeing hearing wonderful stories of individual actions by local greek

8674 :  no other country has received so many refugees but a single story a single story

8675 :  and compare them to the immigrants coming in they are very different

8676 :  because it does

8677 :  i wasnt thinking about how others would react to my work

8678 :  but ill try my best

8679 :  and in my view the telling of a story isnt really what matters

8680 :  its called untitled

8681 :  well its been important in my life

8682 :  and thats what i want to talk about today

8683 :  and number three

8684 :  at least if we dont recover the sense of wonder we wont be able to tell the difference

8685 :  we check our smartphone one thousand five hundred times per week

8686 :  and all these distractions make it very difficult to capture what is really in front of us

8687 :  isnt that too much

8688 :  so this also works for the house for at home

8689 :  what time is it on mars

8690 :  and so here i was living in kind of this darkened environment but so was he

8691 :  and that was because again this eventually becomes hard

8692 :  we didnt start out thinking that we were going to need mars watches

8693 :  and these rovers are our robotic emissaries

8694 :  will i wake them up

8695 :  it was just very confusing

8696 :  so they lived on mars time for a month and had these great adventures like going bowling in the middle of the night

8697 :  ok were getting ready for mars time

8698 :  so while she sleeps we work on her program for the next day

8699 :  it was a huge bonding experience with the other members on the team but it is

8700 :  so i am a spacecraft engineer a spacecraft operations engineer at nasas jet

8701 :  are you awake

8702 :  and i decided ok so he needs a mars watch

8703 :  is it ok to call

8704 :  and when we have satellites well have satellites for education for entertainment

8705 :  i should put these programs up on satellite and send them over the united states

8706 :  we are going to have satellites

8707 :  and its extraordinarily difficult for these people to find the work that they so often need very badly

8708 :  maybe i can work tomorrow but i dont know if and when yet

8709 :  she can go to airbnb to list her sofa bed she can go to taskrabbit

8710 :  so government then exits the frame

8711 :  so if theres a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and

8712 :  well she might be willing to work odd hours in a call center in a reception area in a mail room

8713 :  theres all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people possibly already

8714 :  its all extremely low overhead

8715 :  it manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways

8716 :  and imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told whoever comes in at the lowest percentage

8717 :  there is a precedent for technology enabled service that has been initiated by politicians in

8718 :  their availability for work can be such that its a few hours today

8719 :  a modern market is more than a website its a web of interoperable marketplaces back

8720 :  so its small trades by small people but its very informed safe

8721 :  and its not just caterers its hoteliers its retailers its anyone who provides services to the public or businesses

8722 :  some rough research suggests this could unlock around one hundred million pounds worth a day of new economic

8723 :  which is a tragedy because there are employers who can use pools of very flexible local people

8724 :  you basically make a big fire outside throw some rocks in that fire

8725 :  thats how old it was

8726 :  ours tend to be nine
8727 :  thank you guys for your attention

8728 :  if we know so much about the polar vortex why are the weather measurements so off

8729 :  you give the knife out

8730 :  and we could talk about why this is deceptive why you dont notice there are only three fingers down here because

8731 :  it groups them

8732 :  in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you this finger right here my index finger is

8733 :  ill get my sleeve back

8734 :  i take this hand away

8735 :  and then i open my hand up

8736 :  but you cant count my fingers right now can you

8737 :  i hold the knife in my hand

8738 :  its a really this graph well ill show it to you some other time when we have slides

8739 :  people in the satellite room are starting to move in now

8740 :  ill do it for you and then ill explain it

8741 :  but we cant see whats the matter

8742 :  we cant see into the engine room

8743 :  slightly technical some physicists will disagree with this

8744 :  and he said well ive no idea

8745 :  but i guess somebody will find a use for them someday

8746 :  nobody ever will

8747 :  and he said why cant i

8748 :  dont let anyone tell you they understand electricity

8749 :  whats the point of these radio waves that youve found

8750 :  and you cant see the past except in your memory

8751 :  what are we

8752 :  i dont know if you know this

8753 :  the point most of us

8754 :  and i said yes

8755 :  you cant see the future obviously

8756 :  we needed more time

8757 :  you dont want to drive drunk you dont want to dive drunk

8758 :  so welcome and thank you on behalf of the department of corrections and rehabilitation

8759 :  were just getting started bringing up a lot of our rehabilitation programs

8760 :  why didnt i understand

8761 :  hardly appropriate at this moment in time

8762 :  he thought i was mad enough anyway

8763 :  i was twentyeight years old

8764 :  i know i can drive

8765 :  where did it go wrong

8766 :  i always run it perfectly fine

8767 :  and for the next eleven years i swore nobody would ever find out that i couldnt see because i didnt want to be

8768 :  and then i remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me what do you want to be

8769 :  i was born in one thousand nine hundred and seventyone
8770 :  a construal being how we perceive the world around us and crucially how we perceive peoples behaviors

8771 :  people who had started the day as strangers were by the end of it sharing mutual

8772 :  imagine being in a space like that yourself

8773 :  working to create vibrant diverse and harmonious communities

8774 :  i couldnt put my sister and my mother through that again

8775 :  that apathetic attitude poured over into high school and i eventually got kicked out of three different high

8776 :  i didnt consider myself a criminal

8777 :  if it doesnt work whats the loss to you

8778 :  so i took them up on their offer

8779 :  and at that moment i realized they dont care about me

8780 :  i dont deserve this

8781 :  this is about your family

8782 :  it was then that i said to myself this is not about you anymore

8783 :  hey well pay for it well bring you to the class you know

8784 :  dont say its not for you unless you give it a shot

8785 :  i didnt work for it

8786 :  they served as my counselors they came to my house unannounced to make sure i was ok

8787 :  so at that point i said youve got to make a change

8788 :  receiving that grade motivated me to want to go on immediately in full time in the next semester

8789 :  i became what i saw every day

8790 :  would the world be a better place

8791 :  and so i did so

8792 :  there are social and emotional components of the model and also chances to develop leadership skills which

8793 :  im being pushed into a grave

8794 :  youre offering to put me in hospitals

8795 :  hi i said and then i returned to the couch where i sat in silence for several moments

8796 :  the point is on your head

8797 :  they wouldnt experience restraints as we would

8798 :  hospitals are bad theyre mad theyre sad

8799 :  you need to leave if you think youre going to do that said marder

8800 :  tell the clocks to stop

8801 :  delusions are fixed and false beliefs that arent responsive to evidence and hallucinations are false sensory

8802 :  lets go out on the roof

8803 :  occasionally i have hallucinations like one time i turned around and saw a man with a raised knife

8804 :  there are people with schizophrenia and these people may be your spouse they may be your child they may be your

8805 :  steve both a lawyer and a psychologist has treated many patients with severe mental illness and to this day hell say

8806 :  its been estimated that one to three people die in restraints

8807 :  what have i done wrong

8808 :  we need to invest more resources into research and treatment of mental illness

8809 :  i never struck anyone

8810 :  everything about this illness says i shouldnt be here but i am

8811 :  are you on drugs

8812 :  marder a schizophrenia expert who was following me for medication side effects

8813 :  second i have many close family members and friends who know me and know my illness

8814 :  one must stay away

8815 :  my head was too full of noise too full of orange trees and law memos i could not write and mass murders

8816 :  after returning from a trip to oxford i marched into kaplans office headed straight for the corner crouched down

8817 :  time has come

8818 :  fortunately i did not actually enact that grave prognosis

8819 :  that is at best i was expected to live in a board and care and work at menial jobs

8820 :  the wall that kept me elyn professor saks separate from that insane woman hospitalized years

8821 :  tell them not to kill me

8822 :  theyd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals

8823 :  even in this state what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic i refused to take more medication

8824 :  youre frightening me one of them said and rebel and val headed back into the library

8825 :  a sound came out of my mouth that id never heard before half groan half scream

8826 :  recently a friend posed a question if there were a pill i could take that would instantly cure me would i take it

8827 :  today id like to say im very pro psychiatry but very anti force

8828 :  these relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of

8829 :  i felt that if i could manage without medication i could prove that after all i wasnt really mentally ill it was some

8830 :  i think you need to be in the hospital

8831 :  immediately after the appointment with kaplan i went to see dr

8832 :  i never harmed anyone

8833 :  after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job my new haven analyst dr

8834 :  also we must stop criminalizing mental illness

8835 :  the better we understand these illnesses the better the treatments we can provide and the better the treatments we can provide the more we can offer

8836 :  this is a place that not only accommodates my needs but actually embraces them

8837 :  i dont think force is effective as treatment and i think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a

8838 :  the situation is grave i moan

8839 :  often speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence

8840 :  one of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that i was gravely disabled

8841 :  please continue to let us see characters in your movies your plays your columns who suffer with severe mental

8842 :  oh you know the usual

8843 :  a message to the entertainment industry and to the press on the whole youve done a wonderful job

8844 :  eventually i made my way back to my dorm room and once there i couldnt settle down

8845 :  so the following episode happened the seventh week of my first semester of my first year at yale law school

8846 :  but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status and there are people with the illness who

8847 :  and i am i think for three reasons first ive had excellent treatment

8848 :  several years ago i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey and i want to share some more of that

8849 :  they make certain points

8850 :  gravity is pulling me down

8851 :  all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers

8852 :  american prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer from severe mental illness and many of them are there because they never

8853 :  tell them not to kill me

8854 :  no way no drugs

8855 :  eventually i came to los angeles to teach at the university of southern california law school

8856 :  whos what whats who heaven and hell

8857 :  this is the real me i announced waving my arms above my head

8858 :  would you get a divorce

8859 :  some attribute this golden world knowledge to plato others to pythagoras

8860 :  canada and the us are the only two industrialized nations in the world that dont require mandatory

8861 :  this study was done by the journal of pediatrics

8862 :  as of today

8863 :  meanwhile the organic farmer is held liable to fix the problem

8864 :  sounds like a tasty after school snack to you

8865 :  i founded a non profit organization called kids right to know

8866 :  it all started with my speech in grade six to inform my classmates

8867 :  i watched people purchase large amounts of chips dips sodas and lemonades without ever knowing the ingredients had been

8868 :  new and improved

8869 :  anyone who was marching against monsanto was stupid

8870 :  what if i told you that this corn was not engineered to taste better or to give you more nutrients or to be

8871 :  and not like afraid respect just like respect respect

8872 :  your rank said something about your history and the respect you had earned

8873 :  there didnt seem to be a

8874 :  but its also a service

8875 :  and suddenly everything gets quiet

8876 :  how diligently you followed those rules spoke volumes about the kind of marine you were

8877 :  everything you do is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose

8878 :  or for not talkin back

8879 :  and im frickin batman

8880 :  but they dont count on me

8881 :  is gonna come between batman

8882 :  cause all batman really wants to do is save people and maybe pay abuelas bills one day and die happy

8883 :  and the one good for nothing left standing grips a handgun and aims it straight up like hes holding jesus hostage like hes threatening

8884 :  but regardless it was difficult

8885 :  and his cheeks is drippin but not with sweat

8886 :  and maybe get like mad famous for real

8887 :  what would happen if that actually did exist

8888 :  i am a bit of a science nerd so i dont mind talking about this stuff

8889 :  actually maybe people could sing

8890 :  were going to talk it through

8891 :  i rarely have to solve problems by myself

8892 :  lets figure out what does that look like

8893 :  the biggest one was that the co2 level inside the capsule began to increase

8894 :  what resources are available

8895 :  were very similar in lots of ways

8896 :  people are throwing out ideas

8897 :  we want new ideas

8898 :  that was what was important

8899 :  he put the us reputation on the line

8900 :  what time is available

8901 :  they had a deadline that involved actual death

8902 :  and i was like well no

8903 :  they had a deadline

8904 :  how are we going to solve the problem

8905 :  they were hoping and praying

8906 :  its kind of interesting

8907 :  people go to parks they bring food with them to the park and have a picnic

8908 :  we have different ideas sometimes

8909 :  maybe the waiters could sing

8910 :  i dont think anyone cared

8911 :  i rarely work alone

8912 :  i work with a team

8913 :  so i thought

8914 :  i went to work on an organic farm close to bern and that was the first time that

8915 :  and thats great because manure is a fantastic organic fertilizer

8916 :  a whole army of microorganisms starts to take apart all that organic

8917 :  and when brought out to the field that manure seeps into our groundwater and rivers and causes

8918 :  instead only eat meat and cheese from cows that were fed on

8919 :  now some people like to drink that

8920 :  earthworms that are the backbone of a healthy fertile soil come rushing to the surface

8921 :  now composting is just a little bit like baking

8922 :  when we europeans were still taking a dump in our backyards and dying of the plague

8923 :  and in fact ammonia causes acid rain

8924 :  i ended up getting an invitation to give a pitch at the annual meeting of the swiss

8925 :  cows goats and sheep may unlock this abundant resource to us and

8926 :  this is but one of many aspects of how our industrialized agriculture today

8927 :  i imagine a world were every farmer composts his manure with

8928 :  and maybe one day we will be able to build up soil fertility to such an extent that we may

8929 :  so i have a vision for a world where cows only eat

8930 :  now let me quickly explain to you how that happens and how that is going to help save our

8931 :  we call it quantum wave duality

8932 :  there is the very famous double slit experiment in quantum mechanics in which we are claiming that the same

8933 :  another thing which is very peculiar for quantum mechanics is entanglement or the notion of

8934 :  these are the things why i am so in love with quantum physics why i am so passionate about quantum

8935 :  who was the most important personality of the 20th century

8936 :  this is one of the paradoxes devised by albert einstein when he tried to convince people that there are some

8937 :  but again this is exactly whats happening in quantum physics

8938 :  and i believe that quantum physics is something in that direction that it is so complicated

8939 :  if we would not be able to understand quantum physics none of this would be existing around us

8940 :  my question ladies and gentlemen

8941 :  play with people who make you happy

8942 :  play with people who make you happy

8943 :  those people who make you sad all the time are not your friends darling

8944 :  whos got their back

8945 :  and you know what

8946 :  i think it can

8947 :  what happened then

8948 :  and what i want to know is

8949 :  we realized that she was being bullied

8950 :  and it is possible to integrate art into the teaching of all subjects

8951 :  those children wholl play with anything they can get their hands on

8952 :  the second capacity that we should develop in our children is a capacity for a

8953 :  and the title of the article said miracle fiber

8954 :  for their sequential thinking

8955 :  just the left side of their brain

8956 :  and the three capacities that we should develop in them should align with the three essential

8957 :  they slip the book out of their desk onto their lap and they read while the teacher is teaching

8958 :  whatever it is think about what you wanted to do as a kid

8959 :  most of us couldnt

8960 :  my name is tracey spicer and im no longer a vain fool

8961 :  i mean it is expensive and it is full of nasty chemicals

8962 :  you might as well think about things you wanted to do as a kid and think right i can do that now

8963 :  and yet every time i go out without make up the comments are always the same

8964 :  and there will be backlash there always is

8965 :  there were no lips

8966 :  gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the american economy but theyre also a drain on individual

8967 :  they werent farmers they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground

8968 :  it also makes it very viscous

8969 :  we actually encourage people to drive more

8970 :  if it sank it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill

8971 :  and the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the

8972 :  so i was told about ten years ago that this would never happen

8973 :  and these objects are visually identical but when the avatar crosses the surface of these

8974 :  ninetyfive percent in some cases

8975 :  if we cant do it ourselves or see it being done youre hard pressed to make us believe

8976 :  ninety percent of cancers are curable if caught in stage one

8977 :  they understand the deepness of love

8978 :  buckle your seat belt up in your car

8979 :  it was a pleasure it was an honour to be someone who could provide laughter

8980 :  some of us say it but we dont mean it

8981 :  lifes a crapshoot man

8982 :  the wonderful thing about all of us is as we grow and we begin to experience life

8983 :  so theres this profound mythology around whistleblowers which says first of all

8984 :  some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said i dont want to be a victim

8985 :  you have chosen not to know

8986 :  she always felt a little bit of an outsider although shes been there almost all her life a woman of russian

8987 :  it was in the football ground

8988 :  eighty five percent of people know theres a problem but they wont say anything

8989 :  you can see willful blindness in banks when thousands of people sold mortgages to people

8990 :  but she was really amazed

8991 :  and he said you know im not the kind of guy to rat people out but some

8992 :  hed been a miner

8993 :  and what theyre very prepared to do is recognize that yes this is going to be an argument

8994 :  the advent of the internet was supposed to bring this democratized

8995 :  and so what i want to do now is extract the lessons of the internet experience of the past

8996 :  i want you guys to look around you look at the stage look at whats in front of you

8997 :  now with vr were tasked with a design challenge

8998 :  the stuff that ive been talking about

8999 :  and this feeling made me pause and take stock

9000 :  but as i was planning our future strategies and how we would help develop the virtual reality

9001 :  in effect on the internet we all see a different version of reality

9002 :  its virtual reality

9003 :  well i think vr is going to evolve in ways that we cant anticipate

9004 :  so network effects explain why so few firms dominate the internet

9005 :  i had this feeling that it was like one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour when netscape the first commercial web browser

9006 :  so if we want to do something about it we need to work at it

9007 :  and most recently weve actually developed our first occulus rift experience with a company

9008 :  free has a price

9009 :  and i want him to be successful in this augmented reality hes growing up to experience

9010 :  i dont want him to be some kind of unaware exploited participant in a

9011 :  we know that as we move into a vr saturated world this will be part of that

9012 :  it has far more to do with what i can perceive than what it is that i can do

9013 :  so im going to show you were going to play just for a second

9014 :  and were going to play on this palette

9015 :  you have no time for projected ideas

9016 :  and at some point christian will introduce this note

9017 :  if i come up and i dictate to the band that i want to play like this and i want the music to

9018 :  so its unpredictable

9019 :  when you do that you engage and inspire the other musicians and they give you more and gradually it builds

9020 :  but that could have happened maybe maybe not

9021 :  im going to try

9022 :  come join me

9023 :  im going to be an honest lawyer

9024 :  well im going to stay in the university

9025 :  without taking the chance of ruining some of what we already have in order to progress further

9026 :  but if youve the ability to persevere and find whats truly unique to you and start

9027 :  but well comeback to that later so try to stick with me

9028 :  these are those who conform the people who are so focused on keeping their picture pretty

9029 :  in fact its the rubiks cube that show us that progress cannot be made without twisting the gears

9030 :  so i will try to show you that today

9031 :  those are the currency

9032 :  you charge another inmate to clean his cell

9033 :  that was my full time job unloading trucks at a food warehouse for five
9034 :  i lost a year of my life from it

9035 :  theres pretty illegal hustles you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell

9036 :  i unloaded trucks

9037 :  for the most part everyone was just trying to survive

9038 :  why would people feel pleasure when they execute revenge

9039 :  we all benefit from this

9040 :  but as people start betraying the social good we all suffer and we all suffer to a great

9041 :  because the people running that store dont want anybody to have the pen and the money at the same time so they create this

9042 :  i love all of these women i admire them i am friends with all of them but this is the one i am going to spend the rest of

9043 :  and not only that the part of the brain that gets activated when people plot and execute revenge

9044 :  its true you just lost one hundred but if you go into your checking account and you write

9045 :  as society is moving towards electronic transaction dealing with people over great distances what

9046 :  what youre really telling them is

9047 :  so whats the lesson from this

9048 :  how well do you understand me

9049 :  besides from revenge being altruistic

9050 :  because thats the first lesson

9051 :  and yet i promise you he learnt the most valuable lesson that day

9052 :  thats probably some of us in this room

9053 :  that experience has stuck with me forever

9054 :  because it turns out i was very lucky growing up in argentina because i got to experience things that most people

9055 :  lets start finding fun and engaging ways to allow our children to experience

9056 :  but how many of us got any financial education at school

9057 :  so once weve figured out how to earn money many of us struggle how to keep it and my experience

9058 :  and third is that we need to look at ocean basin wide management

9059 :  and in order to do that you also need ocean basin management regimes

9060 :  today im going to take you on a voyage to some place so deep so dark so

9061 :  so when we were sure that the monkey had reached his plateau of spontaneous recovery

9062 :  youre happy in the moment sure but thats only because the thrill is in the chase

9063 :  positive psychology expert dr

9064 :  i get that for newbies that may be a little bit extreme

9065 :  i have no idea where to begin

9066 :  on the banks time

9067 :  yes it can cost roughly one thousand dollars

9068 :  this is design

9069 :  you want to design a new frame for a drone

9070 :  the last time i was at his house his brother said hang on a second daniels not ready

9071 :  i went to the beach and i tried to give that to five more people

9072 :  i turn around to pick up my things

9073 :  as i do they start laughing hysterically they say weve a big guy in the back that needs to get in shape will you look after him

9074 :  the guards pull up at the end of the session put down the window they say pat lock your bike grab your

9075 :  people later told me that was genius outdoor training

9076 :  from a distance you saw a group doing exercises and running between cones but really what it was about was

9077 :  eventually curiosity got the better of him

9078 :  thats the power that one conversation can have and one interaction can have

9079 :  we are coming back for you dont go anywhere

9080 :  that one conversation resulted in hundred of clients in galway and that one conversation resulted in thousands of clients

9081 :  i advertised the fitness class down on the local beach

9082 :  that one conversation resulted in a quarter of a million for charity and that one conversation resulted in two hundred thousand people a

9083 :  another gentleman who walked in it was his first day also

9084 :  how does it feel to know that really all we are is a bunch of juggling hamsters sprinting towards an inevitable crash

9085 :  whats the most important thing i can do today

9086 :  its why some people create extraordinary explosive exponential results and other people

9087 :  i feel like it was pretty much single handedly ushered in by the late great dr

9088 :  what i realized in that moment from a two year old is that today time management is no longer just

9089 :  i had been studying martial arts since i was five
9090 :  but a multiplier realizes that if i save thirty minutes a month from paying my bills by setting up online bill

9091 :  a couple of years after that kevin adopted me and i change my last name from rory maclachlan to rory vaden and they

9092 :  you multiply time by giving yourself the emotional permission to spend time on things today that create more time tomorrow

9093 :  so there is no such thing as time management

9094 :  or someone rises up to the call of leadership

9095 :  we advanced through the belt levels together and so kevin started bringing me home from class every once in

9096 :  procrastination is the foundation of all mediocrity

9097 :  no work daddy

9098 :  and what you find is that if something can continually wait often what happens is you develop the courage to do what you

9099 :  waiting to do something because were deciding that now is not the right time that isnt procrastination

9100 :  like checking email twentyfour hours a day seven days a week

9101 :  well rory wait a minute in the take the stairs book you said

9102 :  soon kevin came over on the weekends and we would practice our forms

9103 :  its not just innovation compassion and passion compassion in the heart and passion in the belly

9104 :  and therefore each component had to have a dual functionality

9105 :  and infants die

9106 :  all the time you have been given an envelope

9107 :  and then he said well i must give them a car that they can afford one lakh car two thousand car

9108 :  no im sorry

9109 :  can you believe it

9110 :  thats the new world that we want to create

9111 :  but i was about to leave the school because my poor mother couldnt afford schooling

9112 :  if it has there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains

9113 :  i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain

9114 :  we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing

9115 :  and if that were successful that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome

9116 :  when students ask me what can i do for the environment

9117 :  except in the not too distant future its also going to not only restore and replace lost function

9118 :  but if theres a significant competitive advantage if our survival is at stake

9119 :  its an interesting word coevolution

9120 :  and in the sense of when we say technologies this is really a broader sense that it doesnt

9121 :  and so in many respects technological evolution does follow many of the same patterns as well

9122 :  astonishingly they found an enormous increase in the number of new neural connections in those

9123 :  and be sure to diversify

9124 :  she is a great mentor

9125 :  its not the mentor at all

9126 :  the second one which is using them as objects to think with their architectural objects i do a series of provocations i say if this

9127 :  im not asking them to copy exactly

9128 :  and that was the very first time that i found an opportunity to feel that i was able to express my own voice and thats whats

9129 :  and well see what we come up with

9130 :  im not sure if this is going to be good or not

9131 :  so what they are are just pure lines

9132 :  and im going to imagine this you can do this too if you like that im going to just take the letter t and im going to imagine it in mind and

9133 :  i feel like ive got something to say and something to share

9134 :  this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness

9135 :  what are the emotions that can be measured

9136 :  and you can ask what happens to these moments

9137 :  or something like that

9138 :  very different notion

9139 :  but one of them is distinctly worse than the other

9140 :  he had had twenty minutes of glorious music

9141 :  whats so amazing about the marina barrage is that it has been built to make the maximum use of its large

9142 :  and it worked

9143 :  hundreds of organizations downloaded the toolkit

9144 :  and one way to do that is to spend less time in the shower

9145 :  it arises in the skin

9146 :  and i as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother

9147 :  high vitamin d levels i think are a marker for sunlight exposure and sunlight

9148 :  we think its very important

9149 :  and that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city

9150 :  its now a requirement that children have a certain amount

9151 :  so its not just in the cardiovascular system it arises

9152 :  it also dilates the coronary arteries so it stops angina

9153 :  in winter or summer its the same amount of light

9154 :  if your leg is chopped off and you lose blood your body will clamp down increase the heart rate do everything it can to keep your

9155 :  my grandmother grew up in glasgow back in the 1920s and 30s when rickets was a real problem and cod

9156 :  how do you have low blood pressure in your skin

9157 :  and we need vitamin d

9158 :  we couldnt turn off the nitric oxide

9159 :  we dont live in that kind of country

9160 :  i was originally working with adult women

9161 :  ok this is the moment where our girls and young women and adult women begin to be treated as victims not as

9162 :  and so in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight i decided to start gems which is girls educational and mentoring services kind of

9163 :  and so our stories of growing up in poverty our stories of growing up in traumatic

9164 :  i came originally to work with adult women coming out of the sex industry

9165 :  and so thats what weve continuously found

9166 :  and then getting stuck

9167 :  wheres your accent miss

9168 :  just look at the surface

9169 :  like that was just the holy grail

9170 :  my grandfather on my right hand side he grew up in the segregated south

9171 :  and i said you cant get one person to sign up for this trip

9172 :  my grandmother only went to middle school

9173 :  and when i stand here before you today and i say that you know again i grew up during a time where i could be

9174 :  it seemed so far so remote

9175 :  i could still again break that poverty cycle

9176 :  but whats more important is my grandparents which you cant really see them

9177 :  it made me smile because at the end of the day whether she is a hair stylist using her language or

9178 :  thats my passion

9179 :  how will we be treated when were there

9180 :  to them if i could just get a college education i would be ok

9181 :  it is about openning these children up to opportunities that they might not have known existed but now that they

9182 :  how do you actually think that youre going to make change

9183 :  thats about raising the bar

9184 :  but that was about the hope that they gave me

9185 :  and sometimes when you think about opportunities like language or if you think about arts or

9186 :  what we did this year was very interesting as well

9187 :  if you dont know it exists could you become it

9188 :  i was a daughter of a teenager mother who was a daughter of a teenager mother

9189 :  they are reserved for students who have parents who can afford after school programs language programs

9190 :  but its not probable

9191 :  they believed deeply that if i was able to graduate from college that i wouldnt be destined to a

9192 :  what does that mean

9193 :  so my idea around change and what global language project is all about is taking

9194 :  why is that

9195 :  and it also allows them to explore their horizons

9196 :  and they were going to give a group of teens the chance to go to colombia the country for two
9197 :  and when i look at schools in new york and some of them in providence i realize you know that american dream that i

9198 :  and this happens on a regular basis

9199 :  they wont be afraid of it

9200 :  they have to do a small fundraiser but if they cant bring up the money well help them get there

9201 :  gosh they told me this about education

9202 :  and what the kids and the class started to believe was that they were special

9203 :  and thats what we wanted to do around languages

9204 :  the parents didnt want their children going that far

9205 :  they were concerned about them

9206 :  the more we condone the dehumanization of the muslim the more we tolerate the violence

9207 :  we share yusor deah and razans story

9208 :  i was in my car with my three children my son and two daughters all under the age of ten
9209 :  i know you know this

9210 :  the moment that very popular tv shows end

9211 :  we heard some of those kinds of strategies being used in the tesla motors car today

9212 :  its with how people use the product

9213 :  i said how come youre not doing sustainability

9214 :  these kinds of approaches are not hard but understanding the system and then looking for viable

9215 :  thats the latest u

9216 :  so essentially everything that is created goes through a series of life cycle stages and we use this

9217 :  by that time i had several presentations about iran even its ancient sustainable architecture its culture

9218 :  and the third and my favorite group they would react like this so youre persian

9219 :  my aunt has this beautiful persian cat

9220 :  we reached out to other photographers and even bloggers who had good photos of iran

9221 :  and today im here on this stage four years after my arrival in the us and if you ask me who

9222 :  all we had was two suitcases

9223 :  the second group they would go like this after i introduced myself and my nationality they would pause think

9224 :  for gods sake i used to write about it

9225 :  about the same time i made a new friend amandine from paris

9226 :  media can be so powerful to create ignorance and distort the view of a group of

9227 :  and the third chapter of this story goes beyond introducing a country in the middle east

9228 :  i could see in their eyes the flashback to all the news out there

9229 :  i was looking for something different something more self explanatory that instead of me talking to

9230 :  everything seemed good and to be going according to plan

9231 :  a group working on reception day preparing persian snacks of course with saffron

9232 :  or do i show mercy

9233 :  thats a great way to do it

9234 :  whatever youre born with honey that was your destiny

9235 :  what else hammers this

9236 :  now listen up

9237 :  guess what she ended up doing

9238 :  thats not the way it works anymore

9239 :  at the same time sleep does

9240 :  what about getting to work at five in the morning and leaving at midnight

9241 :  i told you that you most probably have addictive like behaviors and you dont even

9242 :  anything wrong with that

9243 :  you see its not a black box anymore

9244 :  she fought her every single addictive practice she had

9245 :  is it reversible

9246 :  heres the solution

9247 :  ending up in the guinness book of world records for holding up the longest plank

9248 :  do you know that rats bagged the morphine and the cocaine and went right for the filling

9249 :  what we decided to do was just something fun

9250 :  im going to show you something youve probably never seen before

9251 :  itd pick them up every single time youd have greens and good whole foods

9252 :  do you want a belly that extends from here to the next state

9253 :  when we change gene expression

9254 :  youre changing gene expression

9255 :  but they do a number on your brain

9256 :  what it was

9257 :  what about zzzs

9258 :  look at everything else we do

9259 :  all of the false fixes we are used to in life

9260 :  it died of every disease very early

9261 :  everyone stand up

9262 :  you have too much stress hormone big belly

9263 :  you cant move your blood sugar

9264 :  but theres one other piece of this too

9265 :  we can peer in there with scans

9266 :  you know exactly what you need to do

9267 :  instead what you actually say

9268 :  actually i did a nice little piece on this and it was fabulous

9269 :  how many of you ever heard about epigenetics

9270 :  we feel so good when we put mind mouth and muscle together

9271 :  late at night

9272 :  were going to start with the mind

9273 :  she fought her food addiction

9274 :  this is what she ended up doing

9275 :  i dont have to tell you that

9276 :  dont have enough sleep

9277 :  and what do you eat

9278 :  when things get a little tough out there its usually that national m nage trois especially for women

9279 :  what do they spend it on

9280 :  surprisingly its not kale

9281 :  oh sure they fix sort of for a short period of time and then they boomerang right back in your face

9282 :  were going to get into that

9283 :  at the same time when you do physical activity at the same time when you meditate the same thing is happening

9284 :  these are what we call false fixes

9285 :  ah the mind

9286 :  none of growth hormone on board when you sleep at night time when youre impaired this way

9287 :  god you feel really good too

9288 :  look at the other brains

9289 :  its a keen grasp of the obvious

9290 :  were eternal caregivers to our own detriment

9291 :  you dont even know youre filling that void with this

9292 :  its violence against women

9293 :  im like no why would i get itchy down there

9294 :  women who are not circumcised get itchy all the time

9295 :  this had happened to everybody else

9296 :  what do you have to say for that

9297 :  are they your new friends khadija

9298 :  i was thinking im mutilated

9299 :  its not an african problem

9300 :  men do you need more than one wife

9301 :  this mindset is what im personally passionate about

9302 :  we want them to win

9303 :  this shapes how we think about our health our relationships how we decide how to vote what

9304 :  but historians dont think thats what happened

9305 :  its nothing to do with me

9306 :  theres nothing i can do about it now

9307 :  people had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street

9308 :  if we take a bigger leap back in history well see that for as long as there have been public judicial

9309 :  i was working on the cranial collections and it just struck me as ironic that here were people coming

9310 :  but were not passive when we watch

9311 :  go on and jump

9312 :  and of course that crowd is growing all the time because every week every month more people will

9313 :  before even when she was only visually impaired she would be able to talk to anybody

9314 :  it became much much more difficult to her not only to her but also to her beloved

9315 :  thats fine because im not one hundred convinced myself

9316 :  i then tweeted about it

9317 :  it is clearly linked to one single event

9318 :  so just like archeologists who dig the centuries old rubbish

9319 :  i think of it as a 21st century buddha

9320 :  why do i have to keep losing all my loved ones

9321 :  in fact it might even make you feel better in the moment

9322 :  but you cant do that when youre busy hosting your own pity party

9323 :  how could it be hurting me

9324 :  so our apologies

9325 :  what to say

9326 :  we must prioritize these families needs both those who are internally displaced and those who are

9327 :  these needs must be prioritized by ngo workers policy makers the who

9328 :  despite all these challenges they faced they were trying to help their children

9329 :  they watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them

9330 :  they didnt know how to answer their childrens questions

9331 :  so actually children can be protected by warm secure parenting

9332 :  i tried that

9333 :  restricting you to a grid helped solve my problem

9334 :  how many of you have used an electronic spreadsheet like microsoft excel

9335 :  it would also depend to some extent on an answer to question one so that we know how to prevent intelligence

9336 :  that make microorganisms more difficult to handle safely than a simple toxin

9337 :  they may use some of the things we care about our raw materials and our stuff to accomplish their ends

9338 :  and then what might that make possible

9339 :  where does it come from

9340 :  i like what woody allen said

9341 :  come on you have got to be kidding

9342 :  i dont think so

9343 :  he said what would be a purpose worthy of who you are

9344 :  this is poland john not california

9345 :  where youre coming from upstream

9346 :  but apparently not

9347 :  what runs you right now

9348 :  now that is something

9349 :  he said he told you it was not bad

9350 :  that is what lights me up

9351 :  and i said how many

9352 :  what do you really care about

9353 :  we dont look backward

9354 :  dont do anything less than that

9355 :  i said transforming the world at work

9356 :  it turns out that was just more than a marketing statement for me

9357 :  this is really crucial so here you go

9358 :  and he said oh a couple of million

9359 :  and that person was me

9360 :  we had friendly iraqi soldiers we had us army soldiers and us marines along

9361 :  a good example of that can be seen with water

9362 :  places like seattle have installed entire parks that are edible

9363 :  let me tell you what ive come up with

9364 :  in fact high school athletes are three times more likely to sustain catastrophic injuries

9365 :  my grandmother was a woman who took extraordinary pleasure in dressing up

9366 :  in india according to custom when a hindu woman becomes a widow all shes allowed to wear is

9367 :  fashion can give us a language for dissent

9368 :  now when most of us decide to wear a pair of jeans someplace like new york london milan

9369 :  no i was not going to magically change

9370 :  widows in india like my grandmother thousands of them live in a city called vrindavan

9371 :  it has the power to fill us with joy the joy of freedom to choose for ourselves

9372 :  and this we can say without a single word

9373 :  however if i today then you tomorrow maybe even more of us someday if we

9374 :  and over time i grew less and less sure that i actually wanted to

9375 :  however he soon started receiving death threats for how he looked

9376 :  i think this went straight to gods voicemail though

9377 :  two thousand miles away in peshawar pakistani transgender activist alisha was shot

9378 :  and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges

9379 :  and up until now its been a supercomputer problem

9380 :  eight rupees versus seventeen rupees

9381 :  you can cough on it you can do a finger blood prick

9382 :  you see even though aluminum is eight
9383 :  we have the capital of the techno philanthropist

9384 :  we have the passion of the diy innovator

9385 :  because we live on a water planet

9386 :  last month mit put out a study showing that by the end of this decade in the sunny parts of the united states

9387 :  the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster

9388 :  picture of a golf ball and a golf ball

9389 :  why are you wearing a hat now

9390 :  maybe its time that we try

9391 :  thank you very much

9392 :  we want the ai to really do it right

9393 :  if they really could do that perfectly i would be really impressed

9394 :  if youve worked with siri you know that syntax is still a challenge sometimes for computers

9395 :  shes constantly asking why questions

9396 :  this watch that i have can do everything the eniac could do with an entire room sixty years ago

9397 :  and understanding science

9398 :  darpa was trying to have people build emergency robots and people did all kinds of work in their lab to build robots that could do things

9399 :  i think maybe we could make some progress

9400 :  but it matters when it comes to things like medicine

9401 :  they can identify a person

9402 :  but we are better at asking why

9403 :  something that i know very well these principles

9404 :  so new things

9405 :  so its really a play between these two approaches

9406 :  that means about one hundred and ninety miles per hour

9407 :  at first they worked to save energy

9408 :  its time to take it back

9409 :  they were under the radiation cloud from the chernobyl nuclear disaster

9410 :  we had just five weeks to raise the three hundred and fifty thousand pounds that we needed as well as to

9411 :  germany has been an obvious pioneer of the energy transition with over one third of their electricity coming from renewable

9412 :  the speed of rolling out of renewables is staggering

9413 :  i mean one day we would say fox trot and people were like foxes trotting

9414 :  this doesnt represent how we think today

9415 :  so we asked ourselves

9416 :  but know that this is history

9417 :  this isnt the present

9418 :  now you just saw two man dancing together

9419 :  watch whats not

9420 :  it wasnt just that we were switching lead and follow its that we stayed consistent in our presence our personality and our

9421 :  the secret lies in what made lisa see our initial demonstration as political

9422 :  respect it revive it great

9423 :  with this simple tweak the dance moves from being a dictation to a negotiation

9424 :  anyone can lead

9425 :  and the other one was called adorable

9426 :  whats different about them

9427 :  and one was called ballet slippers

9428 :  im aware of this custom

9429 :  how did they get me to do that

9430 :  com with what is it

9431 :  it requires that everyone treat choice as a private and self defining

9432 :  its just its difficult to describe this

9433 :  every morning i wake up and i look at all the stuff that google alerts sends me and its just amazing

9434 :  you have to have something that actually interacts with people

9435 :  the second thing thats going to happen and youre going to want to run

9436 :  an everyday death is when youre in a meeting and your boss calls on you to expound upon a point maybe on a project but you have no idea what

9437 :  another everyday death is when you get a rejection letter the fifth one

9438 :  now why does this work

9439 :  and how do we run

9440 :  so i went back to my research which is my safe space

9441 :  a lot of people in my immediate family were dying and they were dying back to back to back

9442 :  so two things are going to happen when youre confronted with your monster

9443 :  and if we dont manage these well were not living well

9444 :  im the boss

9445 :  youll want to get the hell out of there

9446 :  and they werent old

9447 :  maybe you should just quit

9448 :  assume the position

9449 :  we allow economic and social structures adjust fast enough to this new reality

9450 :  second and third orderly effects which will lead to more human elaborate collaboration

9451 :  the associated press uses software to write three thousand financial reports every

9452 :  we can no longer pretend that the jobs of the past are going to come back or that employment will be enough

9453 :  and the story of the last three decades has been the slow disappearance of those jobs

9454 :  and its not just my own family

9455 :  in fact it encourages entrepreneurship and allows people to continue their schooling

9456 :  poor choices dont lead to poverty

9457 :  it is happening across all social media

9458 :  probably male again

9459 :  ill forgive that kid

9460 :  ill be perfectly honest with you

9461 :  i did what any good dad would do

9462 :  id been taught by all my childhood heroes

9463 :  and weve taken care of it but we just want to let you know so you can handle things when you get home

9464 :  hulk hogan the a team remember mr

9465 :  bad guy you bullied my kid and made her cry

9466 :  that was my thing

9467 :  the plant biomass the phytoplankton the zooplankton its what feeds the fish

9468 :  i almost never cook with it

9469 :  i said miguel what makes your fish taste so good

9470 :  five to one he said

9471 :  i didnt know anything about fish

9472 :  best in the business

9473 :  for the company

9474 :  for those of you that have the authority to move forward towards transparency

9475 :  its time to move forward

9476 :  and what would happen if we removed that secrecy

9477 :  i said im doing great

9478 :  he said wonderful

9479 :  but even high school

9480 :  he was staring past me and just kind of looking at the ground

9481 :  hopefully one would soon be able to find a variation which was again able to act against the resistance bacteria

9482 :  theyre so hydrophobic theres no way for them to hide all of the hydrophobic bits

9483 :  that is its what the bacteria are able to turn on once the gene has entered their cell

9484 :  its more thermodynamically favorable for them to avoid water

9485 :  so what have i been doing

9486 :  as your mother may have said

9487 :  this is a word i love you and i probably know what is standout different but theres another definition actually comes

9488 :  why a team framework

9489 :  the first is to understand what the company is trying to do

9490 :  and theyll choose to evolve their promise when they want to stand for something new or the market is no longer responding to their

9491 :  and once the analogy landed he ran off it we talked about the teams that we grew up on as kids i said i grew up on a

9492 :  d analogies work really well for me and works well for him

9493 :  and there are three parts to a brand evolution process

9494 :  when doing brand

9495 :  what we know about this foxp2 and neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths who

9496 :  how do we know this

9497 :  and that question is whether in this modern globalized world we can really afford to have all these different

9498 :  now this may sound arrogant or even full of hubris

9499 :  when you pick it out of your drawer in the morning what should i wear

9500 :  then we bump it up

9501 :  this is your right

9502 :  this reminds us that we have a responsibility to each other and a relationship as a

9503 :  how many world changing ideas potentially get lost through that which access to a secure

9504 :  last year at a football tournament in england a group of kids who had reached the semi final stage had to

9505 :  michael had been summoned in to attend a fitness for work interview which despite his many

9506 :  and its not free money its not money for nothing its not the idea of giving people nothing for we

9507 :  in scotland and here in glasgow were exploring experiments about how we can test this out in practice

9508 :  but the lack of access to food during school holidays meant that these children were going hungry in a

9509 :  when so many people are living and working through jobs where they are not sure how long their employments are going to last for

9510 :  all of us rely upon the structures of the state of international relationships and of what has been done for

9511 :  yet we see now a system where that right to protect you and get you a house didnt help matthew and

9512 :  most of us probably can think of it pretty quickly sadly some people will still probably be in it

9513 :  what was different than before

9514 :  pretty hard to focus right

9515 :  maybe you hear a propeller noise you look up thinking its going to be right above you because it sounds so close and it is

9516 :  try to imagine that youre driving your car or riding you bike to work

9517 :  imagine if you added to that noise created by seismic surveys noise created by drilling in the

9518 :  what if their food moves as well

9519 :  and perhaps more importantly the noise that is created by these surveys is actually operating at a

9520 :  sound and how its affecting marine mammals in the north

9521 :  so heres the problem

9522 :  the second is columbus finally gets funded to go to india but he gets lost

9523 :  now its very easy to assume that those books because they were from a library called bait al hikma were muslim books but thats not the

9524 :  in a world like that theyll always be a job for superman and the ninetynine
9525 :  its a story passed on generation after generation

9526 :  those are basic human values

9527 :  we had a baby

9528 :  and he said hi

9529 :  red was made illegal

9530 :  and i took away the name of the writer the name of the unclear everything was gone except the facts

9531 :  and so the backstory of the ninetynine takes place in one thousand two hundred and fiftyeight which history tells us the mongols invaded baghdad and

9532 :  i became timely

9533 :  in october two thousand and ten the justice league of america will be teaming up with the ninetynine
9534 :  im licensed in new york state

9535 :  equine veterinarians also know that occasionally a mare soon after

9536 :  every medication that we prescribe or that weve taken ourselves or weve given

9537 :  or it just feels weird to you when youre trying to do it

9538 :  and youll close the sale

9539 :  this is that great big secret

9540 :  i think thats what helped drive this

9541 :  so what can we do

9542 :  we need to create a conversation around these shared values and around how climate change is affecting all

9543 :  the media may not tell us what to think but they tell us what to think about and its not global warming

9544 :  when i first started working with climate scientists i realized that people had a hard time understanding some of them

9545 :  the solutions to climate change are here and available to us now and they offer such a

9546 :  all of these things are happening now

9547 :  some aspects of this failure are inadvertent and innocent like how some scientists communicate

9548 :  she worked in a business but people hated working for her

9549 :  i wanted to speak up but i just felt like i couldnt

9550 :  dr bruce lipton in his bestseller biology of belief talks about how beliefs impact us

9551 :  improve interpersonal feelings the more people like each other the more they will cooperate

9552 :  so what was the solution using the hard approach

9553 :  what difference did it make in their actions their choices to simplify

9554 :  it has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use

9555 :  the real battle is not against competitors

9556 :  what is the solution

9557 :  this is what the automotive company did when they saw that mr

9558 :  look at home i have two tvs

9559 :  by removing layers

9560 :  when there are too many layers people are too far from the action therefore they need kpis metrics they need

9561 :  and of course the states completely control the recording industry

9562 :  there were russian jazz bands many of them very popular

9563 :  you could watch american films with jazz soundtracks in russia

9564 :  they became so busy they got a friend involved

9565 :  they called themselves the golden dog gang

9566 :  so for a while in russia jazz was ok

9567 :  in music there were lots of experimental amazing things happening

9568 :  young people loved it of course

9569 :  they moved over to these guys

9570 :  for a few rubles people could come in and use a microphone to make a recording of their voice

9571 :  of course im in poland

9572 :  there was no alternative there was no other way to get this music apart from in very small quantities at

9573 :  how to record onto x rays

9574 :  a few years ago i was in russia with my band the real tuesday weld

9575 :  unfortunately he was caught again

9576 :  other people in leningrad started to do it too

9577 :  he was an audiophile he was a music lover

9578 :  but he knew it was forbidden

9579 :  sometimes we are so afraid that we dont make any choice at all and we just go without

9580 :  boring people are unoriginal

9581 :  it will never make a mistake

9582 :  im going to talk about them today

9583 :  they allowed us to do more amazing things in other ways

9584 :  we tell the calculator to do the calculating and we do the actual math because were the only ones who can

9585 :  but thats not what im afraid of and it shouldnt be what anyone else is afraid of either

9586 :  but what they allowed us to do was they allowed us to focus

9587 :  we should be afraid of living in a world where were not actually doing the things we love where were not constantly

9588 :  the college professor my favorite usually slightly graying very dignified

9589 :  you wouldnt want your daughters treated that way

9590 :  but we know that not all police officers are overweight

9591 :  and although i think thats true i also think that if every single time a woman enters the pipeline she

9592 :  but when we get into the voting booth we say no

9593 :  youve seen these

9594 :  we elected barack hussein obama president of the united states

9595 :  because when we do she and we will make it happen

9596 :  she worked for a number of years as a police officer

9597 :  you wouldnt want yourself spoken like that about

9598 :  my sister terry for example is one of the fittest people i know

9599 :  theres a line of research called gender pipeline research and it says this

9600 :  women in the public light

9601 :  stop buying those magazines that marginalize women

9602 :  youve seen these portraits

9603 :  my heart sank because i thought if you dont think a woman is going to be president in your lifetime maybe youre

9604 :  and she was stepping down as secretary of state and barbara walters asked her some really great questions

9605 :  and it found that twentysix of the american people are angry or upset with

9606 :  but it isnt long before our daughters go to school and they open up their social studies books

9607 :  we have to write letters to the editors

9608 :  you wouldnt want your mother spoken like that about

9609 :  but i just dont think a woman is going to be president in my lifetime

9610 :  she asked me about my research

9611 :  we the american people were engaged in powerful imagination of breaking

9612 :  and as she left she smiled at me warmly and she said you know i give you a lot of credit for what youre

9613 :  youre leaning in

9614 :  things like what part of the world worries you the most

9615 :  and you know what it looks like

9616 :  we have to call out this treatment by exposing this media for what it is

9617 :  so when will we have a woman president

9618 :  i mean we are the ones running this place so we can do anything

9619 :  id walk in the mountains every second day

9620 :  then i got myself a piano

9621 :  so i was on top of the world i was fear free and rich and i can finally explore all my

9622 :  so we all have to work and generate money in order to get sorted about our basic needs which

9623 :  why should i pay to get a place to live on

9624 :  so i did it

9625 :  so i leave you tonight with an invitation

9626 :  i went travelling

9627 :  and the only way to do it is to write all the time

9628 :  so when you see a woman with braids or locks draping down her back

9629 :  and i started spraying that on the streets in cairo

9630 :  we had to respond we had to intervene

9631 :  fire broke out again a second time

9632 :  so they come to us and thats what were doing

9633 :  i felt relevant

9634 :  she challenged me

9635 :  thank you very much

9636 :  can i call you back in a couple of days

9637 :  we consolidated we moved to a new position

9638 :  the rounds could be heard everywhere

9639 :  and sadly suicide up

9640 :  divorce rate up

9641 :  thoughts flooded my mind

9642 :  i gave her our answers

9643 :  and when you hear that phrase in the news the fog of war im here to tell you its real

9644 :  suicidal ideations are going up and thats a good thing because that means people are identifying self identifying

9645 :  i got to tampa december before christmas

9646 :  absolutely lets do it

9647 :  how did he die

9648 :  thank goodness women arent as afflicted with this challenge

9649 :  i had a seven month period in my life where i kept a log

9650 :  i want you to have one behavioral health expert on your team just to protect you from yourselves

9651 :  that was good thinking

9652 :  they dont want to go into the system they fear the system

9653 :  thirty at night driving down highway nineteen in clearwater florida

9654 :  it has to be something else

9655 :  in a in our arsenal and the youth and selectively based on the goals at the workshop by the fees are the workshop

9656 :  this is a kind of a blowing straw

9657 :  you might be wondering

9658 :  she decided that she was going to give online dating a try

9659 :  seventyfive percent of them came from within one hundred and fifty miles

9660 :  sometimes their parents would reject them siblings their own children and then their

9661 :  it was so awful but why did they do it at forty and fifty
9662 :  this wasnt rocket science

9663 :  the way the term trafficking is thrown around implies that all undocumented migration into prostitution is

9664 :  people get really hung up on the question well would you want your daughter doing it

9665 :  the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections allowing them to resist abuse and report it to

9666 :  crackdowns on buyers drive sellers to take dangerous risks and into the arms of potentially abusive managers

9667 :  these laws also reinforce stigma and hatred against sex workers

9668 :  and so the fines stack up and youre caught in a vicious cycle of selling sex to pay the fines you got

9669 :  wouldnt we be short changing ourselves if we didnt push through

9670 :  at the price of your health

9671 :  and the fourth one is i had to understand the path to happiness lies in detachment

9672 :  at the price of your mind

9673 :  and i wear this outfit not because i am a master in kung fu far from it but because of what it

9674 :  this concept of mastery which were sold to in the west which im going to go back into in a minute

9675 :  then a voice going push through push through push through push through

9676 :  so ive been back a few months now in the uk

9677 :  we pick those words out

9678 :  so theyre not just doing the autumn winter the spring summer theyre also having to work on pre fall

9679 :  what really happens is that were now looking at rather than two or four seasons a year were

9680 :  because what weve done is weve developed a whole new system of getting dressed which revolves around

9681 :  absolutely nothing to do with it

9682 :  how did they actually manage it

9683 :  but maths classrooms have to change in a lot of ways

9684 :  but they found something else that was pretty incredible

9685 :  so how many people here lets get a show of hands have ever been given the idea that theyre not a math

9686 :  before they came to us they had taken a district standardized test

9687 :  we gave them the same test at the end of our eighteen lessons and they improved by an average of fifty
9688 :  and we want students to know this

9689 :  we have to get this out to kids

9690 :  im going do it

9691 :  so we taught them about the brain growing

9692 :  but it is fueled by a single myth thats out there in our society thats very strong and very

9693 :  carol dwecks research on mindset has shown us that if you believe in your unlimited

9694 :  and only now is the full extent of the need to attend to that coming to light

9695 :  its not just about changing messages for kids

9696 :  im not a math person

9697 :  we think you have to learn those

9698 :  we need a revolution in maths teaching

9699 :  they could name the one person in their class who was a math person

9700 :  we changed their beliefs

9701 :  we have to fundamentally change what happens in classrooms

9702 :  so now theyre ordering out of a field instead of out of inventory in a warehouse

9703 :  collaboration adds capacity and it also builds trust

9704 :  but its not for all farmers

9705 :  growers cooperating informally

9706 :  it was designed for three other goals

9707 :  now i will speculate

9708 :  i think its important to remember that

9709 :  i had a variety of answers that i tried out

9710 :  some of them made sense

9711 :  i also asked you

9712 :  at five years old there are some things that are significant with the number five

9713 :  and so what do you do in that moment

9714 :  the first is we need to acknowledge that we are persuadable

9715 :  in other words its scheduling a little timeline of things youre going to continue to do on the screen

9716 :  theres conferences and workshops that teach people all these covert ways of getting peoples attention and orchestrating

9717 :  its only accountable to maximizing attention

9718 :  its probably ok

9719 :  what would be the perfect timeline that might include something later would be time well spent for you here at ted in your last day here

9720 :  so let me give you a concrete example

9721 :  its the classic race to the bottom when you have to get attention and its so tense

9722 :  i studied at a lab called the persuasive technology lab at stanford that taught students how to recognize exactly these techniques

9723 :  and if youre the facebook newsfeed whether youd want to or not you actually benefit when theres outrage

9724 :  let me give you an example of snapchat

9725 :  you open up facebook

9726 :  and dad i love you

9727 :  but again theyre grossly inefficient because they change the chemistry of the brain as a whole as opposed to those specific

9728 :  in talking with family and friends i became increasingly frustrated by how we as this support network

9729 :  oh i love you

9730 :  and so i already know what you are thinking

9731 :  im getting there

9732 :  im creating an event series called art and entrepreneurship and the main aim of this is to showcase some of the excellent talent we have in

9733 :  by doing so we hope to elevate their career prospects but also help them develop their own business ideas as well

9734 :  these aforementioned factors are creating a melting pot that is bubbling over

9735 :  but my biggest thank you has to go to the artists

9736 :  i hope you enjoy

9737 :  but for some reason ive seen the disappearance of youth clubs and the evaporation of the clear service connections

9738 :  they tell us that attention is very powerful in terms of affecting our perception

9739 :  and thats indeed what we found

9740 :  or we want to give the training to accountants during tax season

9741 :  and to do this we had to basically come up with an experiment in which we could have people generate their own

9742 :  to kind of bring it back id like to make a prediction about your attention for the remainder of my talk

9743 :  so what we do in our research is we have them take a series of attention tests

9744 :  or a surgeon or firefighter missing any time

9745 :  and our hunch was that if you put people in a very stressful environment if you distract them with

9746 :  but before i tell you about what mindfulness training is or the results of that study i think its important to

9747 :  is there any benefit of offering them mindfulness training

9748 :  so we wanted to know what happens when people have mind wandering

9749 :  what about in our actual day to day life

9750 :  what about in the real world

9751 :  and it does so very fast

9752 :  so we want to make sure we offer them very accessible low time constraints to optimize the

9753 :  and things like stress and mind wandering diminish its power

9754 :  and we land there often without our awareness most times without our awareness even if we want to be paying attention

9755 :  does it actually guide us well

9756 :  or soldiers and marines while theyre deploying

9757 :  and im happy to say the answer is yes

9758 :  often it happens without our awareness

9759 :  can we protect against the lapses in attention that might arise over high stress

9760 :  and under stress its even worse we mind wander more powerfully and more often

9761 :  well we want to for example give it to students right around finals season

9762 :  but thats all in the context of these very controlled laboratory settings

9763 :  they were not as reactive

9764 :  and those are also the moments in which we want their attention to be in peak shape so they can perform well

9765 :  we track their attention at the beginning of some kind of high stress interval and then two months later we track them again

9766 :  im assuming there are not many people here who speak icelandic

9767 :  i can see it in their eyes

9768 :  they want to ask me something

9769 :  and rarer still when accompanied as in my case by self

9770 :  they look alike

9771 :  what about american sign language

9772 :  let me give you an example

9773 :  to overcome this cued speech was developed by dr

9774 :  and thats a very significant outcome if you know the history of literacy issues for children who are deaf

9775 :  and it doesnt work all of the time

9776 :  or you can tell someone about it

9777 :  what was the key

9778 :  you can get the word out

9779 :  i couldnt agree more

9780 :  because the death of a child is compensated by one more child

9781 :  and therefore i will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality

9782 :  we get that from the census data

9783 :  this is a quiz

9784 :  uk which is the british google

9785 :  maybe mr gonzalez deserves a fresh start

9786 :  and when embarrassing things happen we can choose to forget

9787 :  and its a hard balance and its a hard call to make

9788 :  but its really not because what they are saying is that eu law should apply everywhere

9789 :  so the core objection to the right to be forgotten is that no matter

9790 :  were not handling out our email passwords for a reason

9791 :  now imagine that that horrible moment is recorded or recounted and placed on the internet

9792 :  but here you have that governmental burden and its shifted onto a corporation

9793 :  it said you have to amend the american the australian every other google so it cant be got around

9794 :  and type in the same search terms and youll get different results which take you to exactly where you want to

9795 :  and this is a really poignant example of probably the strongest case for the right to be forgotten or maybe it is one of those

9796 :  you just type in google

9797 :  but i question that thats questionable

9798 :  and free will that great gift that essential condition of our humanity

9799 :  so in the context of us trying to deal with that tragedy people were looking at the bowler sean abbott and

9800 :  they dont want to do this theyre burdened with it

9801 :  but to them i say this you know what else is unnatural

9802 :  but these values only mean something because of the metaphysical proposition that we have free will

9803 :  but im confident that nature will find a way

9804 :  first name last name mr

9805 :  its not enough to care about somebody its not enough to understand them

9806 :  red black red faster black black black red through the whole deck black black red every single one of them

9807 :  but i always struggled to maintain them

9808 :  and he said sure

9809 :  it shouldnt be too hard after all paleo diets are already popular among everyone from crossfit bros to

9810 :  pre contact eating is just locavore paleo anyone can do it

9811 :  the goal is to get native and hopefully non native people excited about food sovereignty and

9812 :  what classifies as pre contact

9813 :  its no secret that your body fares better when you avoid processed foods

9814 :  for farming tribes there were the three sisters

9815 :  just what is traditional food anyway

9816 :  go ahead and adjust your sails

9817 :  so i was rejected

9818 :  and i choose again often

9819 :  i had wonderful people in my life who came

9820 :  today is today and im glad its today

9821 :  i couldnt do that anymore

9822 :  i still remember that feeling of astonishment and surprise like i have been to india for the first

9823 :  i wanted to be a farmer im from nebraska

9824 :  why is this so different for people

9825 :  its our free will its how i look

9826 :  and everyone does

9827 :  statistics looks back probability looks forward

9828 :  what age did people die at

9829 :  does parliament charge less tax than kings

9830 :  this is what s important

9831 :  wait until we have our life figured out

9832 :  every day i m notified of the news my generation is headlining and every day

9833 :  i ve turned on my light so many times it s not dark anymore

9834 :  why is it that every time we think outside the box we re told to wait until we re older

9835 :  through her advocacy valeria s school now teaches a course about woman s rights and

9836 :  and you need to worry about this and do this

9837 :  it ll drag you by the hand and scream this is important and this is important

9838 :  at seventeen when i kissed a boy on a ferris wheel i realized if i was going to tell

9839 :  i turned on my light

9840 :  the validation project changed their lives and it changed mine too

9841 :  but each time is a new opportunity for you to turn on your light and make the world a little brighter

9842 :  as life goes on you re going to find yourself drowning in the darkness every single day

9843 :  aquinmay is now the first person to come out in his village as gay but not the last

9844 :  five of the population but we are one hundred of the solution

9845 :  all you ve got to do is to turn on your light

9846 :  at fourteen when i was bullied so brutally i started pretending i was sick so i wouldn t have

9847 :  i went back to oahu to become a board certified internist

9848 :  and they wouldn t get well

9849 :  somehow it s okay for the kids to be sick

9850 :  i was taking care of first second third and fourth generation of filipinos japanese chinese and

9851 :  and think about these people

9852 :  how can we ever get ahead

9853 :  and then as time went on more and more people were able to eat like kings and queens

9854 :  i knew what a real doctor did

9855 :  the surgeon general s report of one thousand nine hundred and sixtyfour changed america

9856 :  trim healthy hardy people

9857 :  the philippines japan china korea

9858 :  but there is a diet for human beings

9859 :  except when they went to battle then theyd switch to quinoa and if you go to the middle east these people are from the bread baskets of the

9860 :  so i took a job on the big island as a plantation doctor

9861 :  we had the industrial revolution in its midst of one hundred and fifty years ago

9862 :  juliea baker decided at seventeen years old she was going to change her diet

9863 :  you recall king henry 8th and his court

9864 :  he had terrible chest pains high blood pressure diabetes high cholesterol

9865 :  because the rich western diet feeds them a diet of kings and queens

9866 :  you say i can do that

9867 :  people became wealthier

9868 :  that s what they looked like

9869 :  it changed the western world

9870 :  and then as time went on we became more efficient at gathering food

9871 :  can t you see it

9872 :  i could fulfill what i wanted to do as a physician which is to help other people by applying this very

9873 :  we can work hard to get our employees healthy

9874 :  october 21st two thousand and twelve
9875 :  we must protect the freedom of speech of those who would deny the very

9876 :  but the question remains

9877 :  there are essentially two ways in which you can give greater weight to the interests that

9878 :  it may interfere with those legitimate interests that government officials are charged with

9879 :  are we justified in doing so

9880 :  may we continue to honor that principle

9881 :  one is to define out or to carve out exceptions for types of speech that

9882 :  finally it is recognized that speech is essential to individual autonomy and self

9883 :  we must protect the freedom of speech of those who would reject the very concept

9884 :  words can cause plenty of harm

9885 :  but my example of it is a sign that i saw in a jewelry store

9886 :  i just couldnt believe the poetry of all of it these souls all on their own desert

9887 :  im so glad that you found me

9888 :  and scott aggregated all of the videos

9889 :  this will be a premiere today

9890 :  i actually was moved to tears when i first saw it

9891 :  i said thank you scott

9892 :  and i even loved seeing behind her i could see the little teddy bear sitting on the piano behind her in her room

9893 :  he made sure that everything lined up

9894 :  he scrubbed the audio

9895 :  it wasnt a virtual choir

9896 :  and there were nine hundred people involved in that

9897 :  we had a million hits in the first month and got a lot of attention for it

9898 :  it sounds great

9899 :  and because of that then a lot of singers started saying all right whats virtual choir two
9900 :  so maybe creating an impact crater in this region is a lot like making a footprint in the colorado snow

9901 :  its just a fact of life

9902 :  although it does take quite a lot more to kill a person than to kill a bug

9903 :  let me explain

9904 :  from there it radiated around the pacific

9905 :  change the work week

9906 :  enjoy have a nice day

9907 :  when i draw with my left hand it is a kind of conversation with myself exploring the

9908 :  i knew something was going to happen

9909 :  or would that make me a coward

9910 :  we were walking along court avenue we get to the court avenue bridge and hes holding my hand which i was so

9911 :  i live here in iowa

9912 :  notice that im up here as a cisgendered white male whos very comfortable identifying as a male

9913 :  i can give to anyone

9914 :  after i graduate from college im going to go into the world of theater but when im not working at a theater company

9915 :  they cannot shoot an unarmed teenager dead

9916 :  my editor came in one day and said

9917 :  they cannot knock out a woman in an elevator

9918 :  one of the great caricaturists of america ed sorel once

9919 :  i just think were not seeing at the moment the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to

9920 :  so i come back to my initial point

9921 :  and we would help them adapt

9922 :  and god shook his head and said not this year not this decade perhaps not even in your lifetime

9923 :  and then someone says how should i know

9924 :  so youve got to have a healthy sense of patriotism thats absolutely important

9925 :  youre building on peoples ideas and values that perhaps theyre

9926 :  sometimes you think things are impossible

9927 :  japan has made an announcement

9928 :  america has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be

9929 :  but youve got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally and the problems we have cannot be solved by one

9930 :  it doesnt mean that everybody does exactly the same thing because weve actually got to do more financially to help the poorest

9931 :  they dont deal with the problems

9932 :  but of course the task is to create the institutions that make that global society work

9933 :  but we did get an agreement on climate change

9934 :  it does rain

9935 :  and this mission has a personal root to it

9936 :  thank you very much

9937 :  its like the blood lights up inside your veins

9938 :  so taking this idea further my colleagues also looked at whether serotonin levels influence the way that we respond

9939 :  those who read the article about changeable groups were more likely to be willing to meet with the other side

9940 :  weve got to figure this out because we now live in a world where extremists guided by their moral

9941 :  not this time

9942 :  because barack won by such last margin that it didnt make any difference

9943 :  we used to rely on news org such as the ap afp reuters

9944 :  you can be seen from the side

9945 :  its actually shockingly small

9946 :  well were not

9947 :  thats how many people are around you

9948 :  but im going to do it by moving the light where its needed

9949 :  so its been taking a number of decades to get where theyre at

9950 :  make it more efficient

9951 :  it has daytime running lights

9952 :  im going to make a better headlight

9953 :  instead what studies have shown is that if we consider the patterns in bilingual learning theyre actually very very

9954 :  im a researcher at the university of washingtons institute for learning amp brain sciences i labs for

9955 :  we are in europe after all

9956 :  it also has been linked to several cognitive and social advantages and it delays the onset of

9957 :  research doesnt actually support this

9958 :  that it makes it slower

9959 :  what ill tell you today is that the human brain is fully capable of achieving native

9960 :  i dont think it does

9961 :  it allows us to talk to more people

9962 :  and and what can we do to kind of challenge that

9963 :  and i think parkour directly kind of challenges that

9964 :  we sort of make the rules on what these things mean

9965 :  and the more the more that we have those interactions the more it develops a kind of of a value or an expectation of behavior

9966 :  i want to see a future where we can do information tracking and manage the flow of diseases

9967 :  and thats extremely extremely scary that were letting doctors make decisions based on pattern

9968 :  take that in for one minute

9969 :  every time that our body breaks we patch it up by drugs or we patch it up by as

9970 :  it drifts away bring it back

9971 :  but mostly no

9972 :  how do i know you were thinking about it

9973 :  children dont need to be drugged

9974 :  id be a better ballet dancer

9975 :  we practice this by doing one thing at a time throughout the day

9976 :  and this is what happens all day

9977 :  whether its positive or negative it doesnt matter

9978 :  and i got told to concentrate all the time

9979 :  it goes against nature

9980 :  we dont just add nutrition directly to the soil

9981 :  that would be the industrial way

9982 :  four million other species on the planet

9983 :  to get the dogs for this program we had to travel a couple of hours away to a neighboring village

9984 :  and many thanks to foundation brigitte bardot they funded this program in two thousand and five when we started

9985 :  so through catching these dogs kindly and bringing them back in better health than before only then can we get

9986 :  were just at the beginning

9987 :  so she is my daily reminder of why i do what i do at vets beyond borders which is about providing basic

9988 :  so it does work

9989 :  its been six years now two years after we started we havent had a single case of human rabies reported in

9990 :  so they can recognize that

9991 :  its completely detrimental to the whole project

9992 :  that makes perfect sense

9993 :  what made her stand out to me was that when i was at the kennels i was walking around looking at the dogs

9994 :  five years down the track she is still here with us going strong

9995 :  its the same deal bringing the dogs back

9996 :  its not cowcium

9997 :  im wearing my shirt inside out

9998 :  most fish has more cholesterol than red meat or chicken salmon which is considered the healthiest

9999 :  the scientific term the medical term for protein deficiency is kwashiorkor you

10000 :  dont go there guys

10001 :  now these guys knew the processed and refined foods were not healthy

10002 :  and i said listen as far as proteins concerned its a boogie man dont worry about it

10003 :  and what we are currently doing with pills and procedures and more legislation and more doctors

10004 :  ive seen media moguls like oprah and ellen that are now pushing plants

10005 :  its a mineral

10006 :  calcium comes from the ground

10007 :  and they say well how do you do that

10008 :  so if you want to slay that erectile dysfunction dragon and allow your puff the magic dragon

10009 :  ive seen professional athletes like serena and venus williams and the one running back in the nfl

10010 :  what about calcium

10011 :  were the only ones that have the unmitigated audacity to go there alright

10012 :  im doing it on purpose

10013 :  they knew about the sugar and the pop and the fried chips and the candy bars

10014 :  so as firefighters we have to use all of our wit and we have to outwit outsmart it and

10015 :  most americans are consuming five to fifteen grams of fiber a day

10016 :  lets pick on olive oil for a second

10017 :  ive seen ceos like john mackey and biz stone of twitter and bill ford of

10018 :  not one iota

10019 :  so we would take a little bit of lemon juice avocado some spices and drive it in

10020 :  and thats problematic

10021 :  you start eating plant based and suddenly it goes up to thirty to seventy grams of fiber and now youre regular as a

10022 :  and so this is what i want you to do

10023 :  its about time to fully live your life

10024 :  the fear alone can be paralyzing

10025 :  but it is the choice that you must make

10026 :  for me i am a planner by nature

10027 :  check it off

10028 :  for me what i find as most helpful is meditation

10029 :  all we have are the questions

10030 :  so heres the state of things

10031 :  id like to start by telling you a story about zaya

10032 :  what vocabulary am i supposed to use

10033 :  i wanted to find somebody in that process of initiation

10034 :  so i said well how did you become the medium

10035 :  she did it a couple of months ago

10036 :  how did you get this job

10037 :  and i thought well this is kind of strange

10038 :  we human beings tend to experience ourselves as something separate from the whole we call the

10039 :  i was totally freaked out

10040 :  the monks started chanting and beating their drums

10041 :  the other relationship that ive noticed is so tight is their relationship to each other

10042 :  she had the very same story as the medium of the dalai lama

10043 :  and this is the way ive got to focus that in total darkness

10044 :  my spirits are telling me i have to do it

10045 :  what do you do for your tribe

10046 :  the woman that needs to go to get the water will take her baby and pass it to another woman

10047 :  seventy five percent before the age of twentyfour
10048 :  when i got there i found

10049 :  they expand their consciousness

10050 :  this is a young woman when she went to college she started hearing voices

10051 :  so the one avenue that he could have gotten relief from cut him off because of the stigma of his

10052 :  its very rigorous

10053 :  i did one just to see what it was about

10054 :  how did you get into this

10055 :  she went to see the psychiatrist

10056 :  but thats what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor

10057 :  so thered be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet

10058 :  they patted me down

10059 :  he was happy to show it to me

10060 :  middle eastern male with a backpack

10061 :  they rifled through my backpack

10062 :  now i dont know about you but i feel sad about this rather tragic diagnosis or should

10063 :  perhaps your domestic dog for a while before hopefully becoming feral

10064 :  im afraid hope is not going to be enough

10065 :  it did not take us long to realize that our journey had just as much to do with concerns over the

10066 :  william anders was the first to witness the event

10067 :  am i going to get wet

10068 :  so are you a maker

10069 :  am i going to get wet

10070 :  am i going to get wet

10071 :  and thats why he moved to michigan

10072 :  we create things

10073 :  no i didnt get wet

10074 :  let me say that again playing

10075 :  this was not a man who seemed at all ashamed or reticent about being a holocaust denier

10076 :  the growing assault on truth and memory it came out in many different countries including here in penguin uk

10077 :  he hadnt always been a holocaust denier but in the late 80s he embraced it with great

10078 :  im reminded of a new yorker cartoon

10079 :  we must hold their feet to the fire

10080 :  i published my work the book was published denying the holocaust

10081 :  they are the same

10082 :  and for those of you who havent seen denial spoiler alert

10083 :  ipso facto i david irving am not a holocaust denier

10084 :  but here was the problem

10085 :  not in most cases and not in the preponderance of cases but in every single instance where he made some

10086 :  what did they have

10087 :  the time to fight is short

10088 :  the elvis is alive people

10089 :  we showed a pattern in over twentyfive different major instances

10090 :  i had been judging modern greek based on grammatical rules from two and a half millennia ago

10091 :  no its like how your body reacts to something to which you are allergic

10092 :  they standardised the dialect of the high society in london and they formed

10093 :  so lets try a couple of sentences together

10094 :  thats why theyre called purists

10095 :  where is this discrepancy coming from

10096 :  i would say things like i like sheeps more than goats

10097 :  i was no longer the expert in the language spoken around me

10098 :  so thats their biggest mistake

10099 :  i had been doing the same thing with greek

10100 :  and then it hit me

10101 :  and so its no longer pure

10102 :  because they feel uncomfortable with language change

10103 :  its just a social construct

10104 :  and i would make actual mistakes there

10105 :  language purists are stuck there

10106 :  so why are things our brain does not detect as mistakes judged

10107 :  when was that golden age

10108 :  but literally make no mistake around them

10109 :  so they are talking about the formal language

10110 :  do yourselves a favour and see those books for what they really are

10111 :  and you know what they cannot get over

10112 :  get over it

10113 :  you perceive grammars and dictionaries to be holy books the

10114 :  let me explain that by giving an example

10115 :  because that was the time when language was standardised

10116 :  why are they stuck there

10117 :  a linguistic mistake is not a sin

10118 :  and to whom did you speak

10119 :  its what wakes me up to life

10120 :  this fire is the size of wales

10121 :  so for example one title is

10122 :  so that means there are more women drivers than men

10123 :  i was really unfocused at work thinking about what im going to do on my lunch break

10124 :  but it reflects on how we feel about the automotive industry

10125 :  and my personal favorite

10126 :  they challenged me with questions to test my car knowledge

10127 :  i couldnt find a female mechanic so i became one

10128 :  does your car have boogies

10129 :  of course my ladies came to the rescue by saying

10130 :  i want women to own their cars and owning it means knowing it

10131 :  they dont suddenly happen

10132 :  commanders would sometimes fly over a unit on the ground and theyd talk by radio to them and theyd watch

10133 :  if they look like they are arguing you have a sense i know theres an argument going on

10134 :  that was connectivity for him

10135 :  so the question to ask yourself

10136 :  you know theyre built over time

10137 :  very difficult school some experience

10138 :  do you have real connections

10139 :  you dont send somebody an email and have that kind of connection

10140 :  usually its built through something you go through

10141 :  and it turns out kids love it

10142 :  anyway yeah so thats what were working on

10143 :  how can we make it so that theyre happy

10144 :  we got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit

10145 :  i would pass their sheet of paper

10146 :  could it be that with those more distant things its not a token for one second its something that is many steps removed

10147 :  now you must have all taken a band aid off at some point and you must have wondered whats the right approach

10148 :  in fact every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating

10149 :  what would happen to the other people in the group

10150 :  or how painful was this

10151 :  its in every language ive had experience with so far

10152 :  you would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasnt the case

10153 :  and you weigh these options out you do the simple cost benefit analysis and you decide whether its worthwhile to commit the crime or

10154 :  at one hand we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves so we dont want to cheat

10155 :  so thats what i did

10156 :  now if we think about this in terms of the stock market think about what happens

10157 :  so we said if people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations to these forces

10158 :  go home and they went with the money

10159 :  and i would try to reason with them and say why dont we try something else

10160 :  i felt my intuition was correct

10161 :  and when we see cheating around us particularly if its a part of our in group cheating goes up

10162 :  but if its somebody from another group these terrible people i mean not terrible in this but somebody we dont want to associate

10163 :  they cheat just by a little bit

10164 :  what happens when you do other things like you remove things from money

10165 :  and we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces

10166 :  if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic

10167 :  i need a good push and is the best that couldve happened to me

10168 :  im scared of math

10169 :  here are some things that have to change

10170 :  what happens if i have a really turbulent flight

10171 :  its hard to pick the difference

10172 :  what did you chuck

10173 :  i think people are hungry for actual achievement

10174 :  what can we do with this

10175 :  have you noticed

10176 :  what did you add

10177 :  we just have a different context what will the future be for these people

10178 :  that just means thanks for the heads up

10179 :  this is just new look vam

10180 :  you go yeah yeah yeah

10181 :  it doesnt have to be this way

10182 :  what works is authorship

10183 :  does that make sense

10184 :  there is a better way

10185 :  if you think about it have you ever renovated a house

10186 :  theyre sick of believing something that isnt real

10187 :  people feel like theyre not being consulted

10188 :  this is just phony phony change

10189 :  what would you do

10190 :  people list what are things we could before the change that we could still do

10191 :  what did you keep

10192 :  what did you change

10193 :  so if thats right why did we only capture four out of those one hundred and fiftyone minds

10194 :  i think this is what david deutsch meant in two thousand and five when he ended his oxford tedtalk

10195 :  the second is that problems are soluble

10196 :  now im going to try a trick and recreate an experiment from this morning

10197 :  cultures through their shared values beliefs and experiences will start to identify the same they will become

10198 :  this will be worse

10199 :  now signifiers because words represent always imperfectly some concept

10200 :  if you say democracy here at west point and you say it in most places in the us its not like we think about democracy as the

10201 :  but unbeknownst to him his interpreter either does not best case or worst case of course is lying to

10202 :  but i would posit if you say the word democracy in iraq or afghanistan or syria or libya or in the ukraine

10203 :  now in terms of my combat hypothetical thinking about a translator in this very instrumental way is absolutely fine its a

10204 :  he knows theres a lot of risk for the people hes talking to and doing that he knows that they know that they could face

10205 :  he then goes to discuss signifiers and the relativity of them

10206 :  the last thing i would tell you is challenge the assumptions that are inherent that maybe you havent thought about in a while in

10207 :  those who have been through the rigor of our english department understand what happens when you disrupt that sequence you get

10208 :  the easy example to always bring up is the word democracy

10209 :  now this is kind of a funny example of the relativity of language but obviously you can start to intuit how in more severe

10210 :  pederson was trying to communicate something profound behind all that

10211 :  id leave you with a hypothetical though

10212 :  youre looking for yes or no

10213 :  now do you have any weapons here

10214 :  you guys actually experience this all the time here at west point

10215 :  thats the last time somebody brought me democracy

10216 :  tell pederson where you keep the rockets or we will put you all in a naked pyramid right over there take pictures for the internet all over

10217 :  its about trust and cooperation in a very complex environment

10218 :  the novel is fives and twenty fives by author michael pitre and it follows a marine platoon through iraq the

10219 :  so instead of try to engage a concept he knows or assumes his audience will not understand he has resorted to something more

10220 :  and so the connotation is different

10221 :  you takfiri know about abu ghraib

10222 :  but when you call your friend from your hometown or at another college and say i cant take pass this weekend i have

10223 :  and he can be fairly sure that his audience knows about abu ghraib and what happened there

10224 :  it stands in for a routine series of questions when a patrol investigates a new sight

10225 :  the unit below them determines to that end that they need to reduce the violence to an extent that the citizens can

10226 :  everyone is on equal footing and everyone shares the fruits of our collective labor

10227 :  so for the digital me its the same thing

10228 :  its not possible to do all kinds of experiments at all

10229 :  it costs many dollars to do all the sequencing and so forth

10230 :  well mass timber panels these new products that were using are much like the log

10231 :  we all know that

10232 :  mass timber panels are those twentyfour dot bricks

10233 :  if i asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire it

10234 :  the scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a

10235 :  it was just a story

10236 :  and this is what i discovered in boston that frustration was very stimulating

10237 :  he said well look at it

10238 :  our neighborhood was full of large families where fathers were the heads of households so i grew up

10239 :  what she didnt know was that i thought my life was terribly boring and the last thing i wanted to do was to write

10240 :  some people criticized others praised me for writing about the turkish armenian conflict

10241 :  when identity politics tries to put labels on us it is our freedom of imagination that is in

10242 :  i like it when my characters surprise me

10243 :  the other recognizes no frontiers

10244 :  i watched the man open a pack of cigarettes with trembling

10245 :  i asked her how she did this

10246 :  one draws boundaries

10247 :  this could be a problem

10248 :  it was stunning and no one has done it since

10249 :  we were always missing some

10250 :  it was not without risk though

10251 :  and thats just not going to get you there

10252 :  you just couldnt do it

10253 :  so i want to talk about how to get around that

10254 :  but i want them to play as a mom i want them to play like real world play

10255 :  they love the screen

10256 :  we try skype we try phone calls but my boys are little they dont really want to talk they want to play

10257 :  because the challenge is not losing weight its actually keeping it off

10258 :  for me i have three young boys and i want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents

10259 :  but this phenomenal projects been happening

10260 :  and i think this is because there is less room left for their engagement

10261 :  i got a scholarship but i needed to get myself here

10262 :  we cant do this

10263 :  they were all in a circle

10264 :  so he figured out

10265 :  we gave her the opportunity to come to the class

10266 :  as i went back every time i went i found that my neighbors girls were getting married

10267 :  and the day before the actual ceremony happens we were dancing having excitement and

10268 :  i talked to my father

10269 :  but once youve found that moment where youre flowing and everything

10270 :  and like all such stories this is not a story just of technology

10271 :  to be sure governments have different resources to bring to the table

10272 :  he purchased his own plane ticket and went to the village where this had occurred

10273 :  they were frustrated and they had achieved much less than what they had hoped for

10274 :  editors sat in their newsrooms and waited for the government to tell them what to do

10275 :  one frustrated journalist could not take this anymore

10276 :  compare than to just two
10277 :  but it was much more elaborate they went to great lengths to put money in sami osmakacs hands which he then used to purchase

10278 :  these operations which are usually led by an informant provide the means and opportunity and sometimes even the

10279 :  berkeley and a research assistant and i put together a database of all terrorism prosecutions at the time

10280 :  these include the boston marathon bombings in two thousand and thirteen as well as failed attacks such as the time when a man named faisal

10281 :  thats all we want an equal chance at life

10282 :  these are your children and theyre crying out for your help

10283 :  she wasnt allowed to tell me that she loved me

10284 :  so much so that i didnt want to be here anymore

10285 :  but we are the lucky ones

10286 :  i saw it last year when i was in a church hall surrounded by three hundred people protesting the build of a

10287 :  but i know now wendy was an employee she was a worker

10288 :  and i fell apart in that womans arms and she cuddled me in like i was her own child

10289 :  and i was angry

10290 :  this is what those people had to say

10291 :  ten isnt even a big number

10292 :  those are the people that continue to judge us and want us to be silenced

10293 :  ill tell you

10294 :  but ill never forget the neighbour that used to come and check on me

10295 :  and the neighbour that got me help when i needed it

10296 :  do you think the suffragettes let fear win when they were campaigning for the womans right to vote

10297 :  so if you get people to think about love and then solve problems theyll be better at the globalization

10298 :  so with partners we can behave a bit like proud parents

10299 :  you see mathematics lies right at the roots of humanity

10300 :  imagine being in a relationship with charlie sheen

10301 :  if you approximate youll be prone to an overestimation

10302 :  you see language is more than just naming things

10303 :  thats because the rat doesnt have self awareness or a linguistic ability to

10304 :  easy as that

10305 :  but theres actually a mini testosterone peak every two to two
10306 :  now you see how i used the word approximate

10307 :  i was mad and disappointed

10308 :  why not apply neuroscience to fixing nature

10309 :  how can i help bring them back

10310 :  what will we do with it

10311 :  this generation is the first generation with a users guide to the human brain

10312 :  i wish you water

10313 :  ive been part of driving them to extinction how can i help to bring them back

10314 :  and the question is how will we use it

10315 :  and i used to try to talk about that as a scientist and i would get push back from my graduate school

10316 :  so i wasnt buying it

10317 :  its the mother of curiosity

10318 :  it s one of the great gifts that we get

10319 :  it blows my mind

10320 :  same month every year

10321 :  thats part one

10322 :  youre being forced to be whether you want it or not a kind of global visionary whos changing the world

10323 :  but we dont want just any math problem we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find and we want the one that if you solve it

10324 :  did you notice other people not finding the app that day

10325 :  less is more

10326 :  my mother well mom

10327 :  so far what weve told you is basically we can control this play button of the clip so that we can play this video

10328 :  do i say hi

10329 :  do i shake their hand

10330 :  so what if we could start off by going into the brain and just finding a single memory to begin with

10331 :  first you find and label a memory in the brain and then you activate it with a

10332 :  maybe we can take a look at some of those

10333 :  ever since the publication of our work weve been receiving numerous comments from all over the

10334 :  it turned out that all we need to do is basically to let the brain form a memory and then the brain will

10335 :  and today we hope to convince you that now we are actually able to activate a memory in the brain

10336 :  we even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line

10337 :  we have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating

10338 :  assuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off from truly understanding why someone does and believes as

10339 :  they treated us like family

10340 :  my mom said something to me a few weeks before i left westboro when i was desperately hoping there

10341 :  escalating disgust and intractable conflict are not what we want for ourselves or our country or our

10342 :  this has been at the front of my mind lately because i cant help but see in our public discourse so many of the

10343 :  once i saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth but flawed human beings i couldnt pretend

10344 :  were in a position where the american dream of home ownership is not a reality as twentyfive of

10345 :  why do i have to worry so much

10346 :  instead of aggressively paying it down she only going to pay her minimum payments

10347 :  then shes going to spend one thousand two hundred on rent

10348 :  so meet jessica

10349 :  america is struggling with obesity and this is a show that brings that to the forefront

10350 :  applying those exact same behavioral traits not learning much more about personal finance making a few more

10351 :  i really believe that we can go back to the tens of millions we can ultimately go back to jessica and

10352 :  i want that for jessica

10353 :  in programming in earsketch we often use data structures as ways of holding collections of

10354 :  chorus chorus verse etc

10355 :  that means programming them

10356 :  armando is going to perform a trick

10357 :  dented can undented open can now sealed

10358 :  first off before i answer that can we just acknowledge how hard it is to be a magician in two thousand and thirteen
10359 :  vanishing coke trick

10360 :  you just said that

10361 :  imagine the emptiness the void the vacuum

10362 :  why am i a magician

10363 :  audience give me a no way

10364 :  with years of experience growing oyster pearls and with my knowledge of growing conch we set out together

10365 :  but really this was a drop in the bucket

10366 :  could there be a lesson there for us

10367 :  thats a substantial amount of time

10368 :  well a conch farmer cultivating the sea like the farmer tills the land

10369 :  he came from mexico

10370 :  thats right less than one
10371 :  gemologists everywhere were so excited by this breakthrough

10372 :  i just loved it so dearly i wanted to protect it forever

10373 :  he said well i just told you i failed my exams

10374 :  when i heard about this i went with the interns of my company to this village and we realized that many

10375 :  they said yes but we dont know how

10376 :  the women who were able to work with leather worked with leather the ones who were working with wool were working with wool

10377 :  six billion people myself

10378 :  one billion people lack access to clean drinking water

10379 :  it was a quite lonesome time because people stopped visiting me my girlfriend even refused to come from riga to

10380 :  the best was to become one of those two
10381 :  charlie bresler said to me that hes not an altruist

10382 :  and holly morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism

10383 :  com and giving what we can both have a somewhat broader list but you can find

10384 :  and the answer is yes we can

10385 :  theres about one hundred people each year in the u

10386 :  according to one estimate the gates foundation has already saved five
10387 :  that is good

10388 :  but its six hours the experience

10389 :  and one very important piece i made in those days was balkan baroque

10390 :  so what im doing im staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience

10391 :  thats the tv production company of amazon

10392 :  and all of that goes back to a decision that roy had to make about three years ago

10393 :  they record when somebody presses play when somebody presses pause what parts they skip what parts they watch again

10394 :  and of course thats a highly competitive space

10395 :  taking apart and putting back together again

10396 :  and so when amazon is giving out free stuff youre going to take it right

10397 :  he may have also been responsible for twentytwo very entertaining minutes but not very many of you

10398 :  what kinds of shows they like what kind of producers what kind of actors

10399 :  so instead of holding a competition what he did and his team of course was they looked at all the data they

10400 :  in two thousand and nine google announced that they were able with data analysis to predict outbreaks of

10401 :  even the most data savvy companies get it wrong

10402 :  he wants to engineer success

10403 :  ok thats good actually

10404 :  theres another tool that can do that and we all have it and that tool is the brain

10405 :  then you have a top two percent show

10406 :  the first one is you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and

10407 :  they use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldnt have been able to understand at that

10408 :  but that does not change the basic setup

10409 :  and thats not because a company like multi health systems doesnt know what to do with data

10410 :  i didnt know for sure oxytocin caused trustworthiness

10411 :  first of all oxytocin is a shy molecule

10412 :  yeah ive been worrying about that too

10413 :  so poor countries are by and large low trust countries

10414 :  well this is very valuable

10415 :  we have to find the owner for this

10416 :  but he was right it was a stupid idea

10417 :  but in humans it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women and is released by both sexes during

10418 :  but in fact economists were flummoxed on why the second person would ever return any money

10419 :  we need to know why people are doing what theyre doing

10420 :  and he said hey i was in the mens room

10421 :  yes my mom was happy about that last one

10422 :  there must be a reason why

10423 :  so the way many cons work is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him its that he

10424 :  i saw that people who were religious and non religious were equally obsessed with morality

10425 :  oh youre saving my life

10426 :  its empathy that makes us help other people

10427 :  love says eight hugs a day

10428 :  im in high school

10429 :  heres my phone number

10430 :  get yourself a fat reward

10431 :  now we know what happens

10432 :  we showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary

10433 :  and then we can form in effect a mesh network

10434 :  so we went back and started looking at the great cities that evolved before the cars

10435 :  and then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile and its not that kind of a pattern

10436 :  i mean architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time

10437 :  we think we can also personalize sunlight

10438 :  theyre quite fun

10439 :  you had auto networks

10440 :  we think of it as a compact urban cell

10441 :  so we said lets start with that neighborhood cell

10442 :  these are some of the vehicles that weve been working on

10443 :  actually we could do this today

10444 :  as danielle said more than half the people now in the world live in cities and that will just continue to

10445 :  were not doing a very good job with that

10446 :  go up to fifty thousand if its manhattan density

10447 :  thats sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways

10448 :  i thought i would start with a very brief history of cities

10449 :  we have to get this right

10450 :  but in the end the main thing we need to focus on are people

10451 :  cities are all about people

10452 :  connected to mass transit

10453 :  we dont understand this language

10454 :  i d never heard about that

10455 :  it s not just the whole stage

10456 :  and so each dream is only one chapter and carries the story forward a little bit

10457 :  two weeks later i got a phone call in the middle of the night my father had a heart attack

10458 :  you always see the buddha sitting on a lotus flower

10459 :  it went in a different direction

10460 :  i ll work with my dreams

10461 :  some of them were books about dreams

10462 :  i didnt notice that the same dream kept coming back

10463 :  this will work for me

10464 :  it was wonderful for me

10465 :  i went to my father s place

10466 :  anyone can do this

10467 :  we d work with dreams

10468 :  and it occurred to me i might write a novel

10469 :  maybe the whole campus

10470 :  you don t have to be an expert to do this

10471 :  and then it went in a direction that i didn t like

10472 :  the problems iron out

10473 :  i said no way

10474 :  now the standard idea of dreams is that we have this

10475 :  within a week i was on an airplane down to miami

10476 :  montague ullman went further than that

10477 :  and it came out of me

10478 :  and to look at toys without touching

10479 :  and you kind of like it that way because in real life there is no edit function

10480 :  youre always late though because you just cant drum up the nerve

10481 :  and of course temple grandin

10482 :  im a temple grandin groupie

10483 :  but after she leaves you figure it out so you stay there for a while because youre really embarrassed and youre fighting back tears and

10484 :  but then you think they might not and youre never quite sure which it is until somebody tells you off

10485 :  so you already know the rules

10486 :  so you start eating kale and parsley garnish from the now empty tray and lecture your co

10487 :  so funny i met her at a conference i saw her at the conference

10488 :  in the end making a good forth impression wasnt enough to win over those particular colleagues but

10489 :  so instead you answer

10490 :  if you are a willing aspie allied

10491 :  rich amazing stories of all real people

10492 :  he was willing to look beyond my lack of social finesse in the work place passed the first second and

10493 :  what are you staring at

10494 :  it is not an excuse to remain stuck in rigidity and intolerance

10495 :  and for several weeks we worked on facial expressions posture body

10496 :  we all like to tick off our boxes

10497 :  like with most things in my life i researched i attended conferences i had

10498 :  as i started my rehabilitation as i was working to walk again the only thing on my mind was i had

10499 :  another thing that id grown increasingly cynical about was the way women were portrayed in the magazines i worked for

10500 :  every day politicians use negative rhetoric for their own

10501 :  i was listening to this argument and i suddenly thought this is not why i became a photographer

10502 :  then i also discovered that aya was not a victim

10503 :  i was the worlds worst boxer

10504 :  so with this olympus om ten camera i actually taught myself photography lying in a hospital bed

10505 :  as the months went on i had thirtyseven operations in my first year and through that recovery again i watched the

10506 :  he said giles you take a punch very well

10507 :  they would come in and lift her hand and put it on the wound and say make it better mummy

10508 :  but as youll learn im quite a stubborn character and i wasnt sure that my lack of sporting ability wouldnt get in the

10509 :  i used to photograph the doctors nurses my friends anyone who would come in

10510 :  the refugee crisis affects all of us

10511 :  to put that in context last year during the european refugee crisis close to a million

10512 :  when iman walked in she shouted hey donkey pick me up

10513 :  i had no idea what i was going to do with my future

10514 :  a photograph that you took in afghanistan inspired me and every day i had that photograph on my wall

10515 :  they said shes in the same tent where you last saw her

10516 :  on the last day i was there i got a phone call

10517 :  i said where is she

10518 :  i say the biggest struggle is that in those camps i see humanity i see love i see compassion

10519 :  i was mostly interested in the most vulnerable those with disabilities the elderly single mothers

10520 :  there are so many things

10521 :  small business owners like you work hard every day right

10522 :  he used to say to me

10523 :  raise your hands

10524 :  it comes from the brain not from the works of art

10525 :  what are all the challenges that might get in the way

10526 :  but it turns out there are lots of other folks that would be interested

10527 :  there are over two hundred kinds of cancer

10528 :  first off my teacher didnt scold me she was kind

10529 :  so i came up with a plan

10530 :  well this man in the car behind him was so touched that he bought the coffee for the person behind him

10531 :  and its not just the recipient who benefits

10532 :  he figured this was just some guy having a really bad day and they could both benefit

10533 :  the first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way

10534 :  we first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations

10535 :  i couldnt help but compare how my story was represented on tv in

10536 :  however as feminism waves its ideal picture of the non western world

10537 :  as the bus came and my friends and i were getting ready to board on the bus i turned to the women a big smile on my face

10538 :  rescuing brown women has had a long history in western imperialist projects

10539 :  her jaw hit the ground and that was about it from her

10540 :  so the conversation changes

10541 :  thank you very much

10542 :  and through their story well see that profound change is indeed possible

10543 :  going back to that stormtrooper if i did get that chest plate off in time what would you

10544 :  ill leave you with one point

10545 :  i dont know if you noticed this or not

10546 :  i was coming at it from a different perspective where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem

10547 :  it would really boost the economy

10548 :  i coach them so they know what theyre doing and they can compete and then we celebrate what they do correct even though they dont expect

10549 :  it creates a fundamental bottleneck in the brain that creates a weakness in both informal efforts

10550 :  for example taxicab drivers in london at the end of their training have a thicker brain in

10551 :  so this mental experience of stress especially if its chronic and moderate to severe gradually

10552 :  but the next minute is a phenomenal opportunity for us

10553 :  like me back in college or any one of us today or over the course of this evening what will we do with the most

10554 :  passing mental states become lasting neural traits

10555 :  causes have effects

10556 :  the reason for the negativity bias is that our ancestors had to pay a lot of attention to bad news

10557 :  the mind can change the brain to change the mind

10558 :  a few minutes in the future we start losing a lot of influence

10559 :  cant do anything about the past

10560 :  and if we dont get the supplies that we need bit by bit its kind of like were living on a

10561 :  paradoxically the more we take in the good were more able to see the bad and do something about it

10562 :  you know as we evolved in the serengeti exile was a death sentence

10563 :  in fact this is about taking control of the brains stone age bias in the 21st century

10564 :  we are a for purpose company

10565 :  any type of supplies that they want and it ends up on their front door step

10566 :  we must dare invest in the future of africa

10567 :  with a growing middle class and a wealth of resources that are fast making it a viable market for a new

10568 :  the quiz was easy super straightforward

10569 :  i think its important to know that i am blood related to this man

10570 :  i have five brothers and four sisters

10571 :  i have always been outspoken

10572 :  uncle ed would be home by seven
10573 :  no i am not

10574 :  in the fourth grade we had a pop quiz on a short story we had read together as a class

10575 :  and my sister was dating an ex con

10576 :  and by doing so i was able to see a constant in my life

10577 :  if i catch myself being too private i know its because i want to hide something

10578 :  are his four legs planted firmly on the ground

10579 :  ten questions on a story wed just read

10580 :  and to that i say no

10581 :  in fact privacy scares me just a little bit

10582 :  theres twenty or thirty years of research on this stephen krashen a leader in the field has published all sorts of these

10583 :  and then she came across these five principles she moved to brazil and she applied them and in six months she

10584 :  and if you drop yourself into a context which is all adults talking about stuff over your head you wont learn

10585 :  how do you do that

10586 :  but hypnopaedia did open the doors to research in other areas and weve had incredible

10587 :  we had fortyeight hours to deliver a training manual in chinese

10588 :  come with me on a journey through a forest

10589 :  do them all and youre going to be fluent in a second language in six months

10590 :  and if you cant get a native speaker to look at you can use stuff like this

10591 :  and i also went in with a different idea which was

10592 :  so you actually have to be able to hear these sounds

10593 :  how do you learn faster

10594 :  all in your target language

10595 :  and that has to happen with biotech

10596 :  the power of introverts in a world that cant stop talking states in her official ted talk that introverts

10597 :  and despite our large presence introverts are not being acknowledged enough

10598 :  i am quiet in school

10599 :  eventually i was left wondering

10600 :  grades assignments homework

10601 :  they have for years been focusing on catering to the different learning types whether it be visual auditory

10602 :  do i have to change the way i am in order to stop being called out by teachers for something that comes so naturally to

10603 :  i wish she spoke up more

10604 :  an option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do

10605 :  but what is that really telling us

10606 :  but there are challenges here

10607 :  weve got to slow the pace of coevolution down and there are ideas that we can borrow from

10608 :  this is what economists might call a problem of the commons and the problem of the commons is exactly what we face in the case of

10609 :  what we want to be able to do is invest in new antibiotics in ways that actually

10610 :  we dont want to just throw money at a problem

10611 :  now this is clearly not a game that can be sustained or one that we can win by simply innovating to stay ahead

10612 :  if we taught doctors how not to use antibiotics as much if we taught patients how not to demand antibiotics perhaps

10613 :  one it freed our five kids from following in our steps our shadow they dont know what

10614 :  but also for grammar

10615 :  so thats a big part of what we do

10616 :  how do we express ourselves

10617 :  dont tell us where you are

10618 :  where do we start

10619 :  and people will sign up for a fortyfive day course on building a bicycle

10620 :  part of it will be wrong and it doesnt matter

10621 :  because the first why you always have a good answer for

10622 :  spend an afternoon spend a whole day talk to anybody you want

10623 :  ive always been scared to go

10624 :  js well its not just mathematical

10625 :  so how did you stay ahead of the pack

10626 :  i couldnt make a business out of that

10627 :  hermann minkowski had this geometry and einstein realized hey

10628 :  well more than we think

10629 :  i mean i think it was pure luck

10630 :  it never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics

10631 :  uh im sorry wait

10632 :  bird is only four letters right

10633 :  those characterize the computational properties of this network

10634 :  clouds could help us out with global warming

10635 :  that is a lot of wasted solar power

10636 :  right now these two effects they dont cancel out

10637 :  clouds are formed when microscopic water droplets or ice crystals coalesce

10638 :  but we dont want models to be perfect

10639 :  and as a result there are gaps in our knowledge

10640 :  that sunshade its a little bit more powerful

10641 :  well to a large extent its because they dont agree on what clouds will do in the future

10642 :  but i still go to work every day

10643 :  they are springboards for action and they are our history in process

10644 :  acts of violence committed by or under the name of the self proclaimed islamic state of iraq

10645 :  all she had to do is count by twos nine times

10646 :  there i was working with a student natalie on solving equations

10647 :  its almost like a scene of wasted potential

10648 :  buy the next text book

10649 :  we take the blame for a student who cant stay awake in class because she spends her nights on a different couch depending on which friend takes

10650 :  i specialize in teaching algebra to the bottom twentyfive of high school students and i work mostly with those

10651 :  i teach at a high school with a student population of near three thousand
10652 :  i focus on syndrome from the incredibles

10653 :  she had to multiply two x nine and got stuck

10654 :  who is it that manufactures these products

10655 :  now she tried and failed four different times on her fingers on paper in english and spanish

10656 :  and then what about the natalies

10657 :  ive got students that want to be tattoo artists mechanics barbers they want work

10658 :  the only way to feed a business model in this toxic culture of education is to

10659 :  how can we make sure theyre getting enough sleep getting enough to eat showing up for class

10660 :  natalie was sixteen years old and in the 9th grade and shes not alone not by a long shot

10661 :  ive seen my daughters kindergarten and first grade assignments

10662 :  ill get to that in a minute

10663 :  first words in the response thats not rigorous

10664 :  why not stop judging the fish on how they climb trees

10665 :  for example in our documentary we talk about science and development but we use

10666 :  thank you very much

10667 :  i already wear glasses

10668 :  hes an eighteen year old boy

10669 :  he said but i dont know if you remember

10670 :  but im sure everyone in this room has taught a gary and when youve had the privilege of

10671 :  by now ive got pride

10672 :  so what happened next

10673 :  trust me mr

10674 :  i love that and i always try to remember that when i sit down to play

10675 :  i believe that music has power to give people hope and to help them feel

10676 :  but lets come back to it

10677 :  do you want a lot of shiny objects

10678 :  so decide for yourself

10679 :  there are two things we always have with us when we leave the house

10680 :  wearable solar gives you the opportunity to charge your phone on the go wherever you are

10681 :  and not only did i want to mount six hundred of these on the garment i also wanted to address each dot

10682 :  so we are now looking at solar harvesting fibers printable solar cells and washable textile circuits to upgrade the

10683 :  one of the main issues for instance is that theyre not washable

10684 :  and this kinetic garment can respond to the surroundings in terms of sound

10685 :  nobody knew what to do with it

10686 :  it describes the idea that our contemporary surroundings are constantly changing and they have become

10687 :  these are some of the things that im currently researching as part of my phd program called crafting wearables at the

10688 :  the second month you do the same thing

10689 :  nothing that weve ever done or conceived of in the past has been able to reconcile these two conflicting

10690 :  sort of and not really

10691 :  and one salary was expected to support ten persons

10692 :  at that time i really didnt know how to do that as i do today

10693 :  my dad was a baker and my mom was a housekeeper

10694 :  the vast majority are medium academic achievers and they arrive from families with

10695 :  i was born to a poor family

10696 :  most of its students are girls

10697 :  so what is the secret

10698 :  are you going to spring out of bed

10699 :  that workout always feels good

10700 :  she belongs to my four year old son roan

10701 :  i hope i didnt fail

10702 :  i want to you to meet dixie

10703 :  and it doesnt sell a copy

10704 :  did they have stronger covers

10705 :  if you can write a novel that only you couldve written at that time in that way then you might get your

10706 :  any other stories

10707 :  were they better written

10708 :  the first thing you want to do is to tell someone about it

10709 :  and to be honest authors find it very difficult

10710 :  theyve said its about love death marriage redemption betrayal

10711 :  but i often sat in my office with young writers and said to them whats your story about

10712 :  reading makes us better

10713 :  particularly male absence

10714 :  this was the picture

10715 :  that is that feeling you get when youve read a great book

10716 :  but i discovered the author and together we found a way to discover the right story to

10717 :  all to try and get us to buy the book

10718 :  but i think youll get this if you enjoy reading

10719 :  i learned that in school then i dropped out hit the streets checked a grip and now ive got clout

10720 :  people look at me today they say

10721 :  thats the level of characters i hung out with

10722 :  why is your face like that

10723 :  i know but i think somebody is coming for me

10724 :  what can i do

10725 :  you want to keep people off your back

10726 :  hell yeah i have the day off ill come

10727 :  you seem angry

10728 :  its because they have hope

10729 :  goddamn you got me sinking in quicksand

10730 :  fifty cent said in one of his records

10731 :  my boys who are in pelicans bay cmc my friends the crew i grew up with most got what the

10732 :  i had nothing and i wanted it

10733 :  god will deal with that

10734 :  you really know who ice t is

10735 :  ive got a beautiful wife they want to test that

10736 :  they believe in crime and punishment

10737 :  you got people saying

10738 :  i mean we dont use lawyers i dont use the police im from another era where if we got a problem wed go

10739 :  maybe thats the plan and i dont understand

10740 :  and you are liking it and you are sharing it and everything but you realized you havent actually seen that person

10741 :  its becoming more pervasive

10742 :  several of us can check things like the weather reports the local art exhibits coming to town wonderful information

10743 :  well you know what actually i have a staff member that i can delegate that right over to you

10744 :  evening number two
10745 :  he fell a long way

10746 :  well where do you think we are going to be five years from now

10747 :  you think two thousand and fifteen two thousand and sixteen represent a challenge

10748 :  ill make it up to you tomorrow

10749 :  now there are positives to this

10750 :  ok now let me start reading

10751 :  i was going on vacation to hawaii specifically the west coast of maui

10752 :  im actually about to go and do a bedtime routine with my kids tonight

10753 :  well i dont know im not exactly sure what happened to gandalf

10754 :  the first evening takes place and was much more typical before my hawaii trip

10755 :  we wanted to understand better so we launched a wish impact study

10756 :  there are ninetyone wish recipients as part of this study

10757 :  so we wanted to study it

10758 :  you can have the car appropriate for the thing

10759 :  they are the worlds largest job creators about fifty thousand new dirvers sign up for

10760 :  in this situation what should you do

10761 :  decided to run into the motorcyclist

10762 :  they claim to be able to do that in eight hours of training and now they have a robot that can do that

10763 :  it had a bunch of inputs each input had a weight combine those inputs weighted by these weights and produce an

10764 :  it becomes a much better proposition to always use a uber rather than had their own car

10765 :  oh my gosh we better do self driving cars we cant rely on googles self driving cars so they started a research

10766 :  today if a persons face that in the spur of the moment they would make a decision one way or the other and we would said

10767 :  risk dying yourself or should you risk killing the motorcyclist

10768 :  it might be something to think about if you are looking to work in the technology area

10769 :  most cars today just sitting in a parking lot or sitting in your driveway and they dont do anything

10770 :  they are very careful about pedestrians

10771 :  pedestrian chicken in mountain view youll see a google self driving car if youre a pedestrian and youre about to

10772 :  if theres a pedestrian they would do everything they can to avoid them

10773 :  that has led to what people has calling

10774 :  with self driving cars they can drive all the time so much better use of the hardware

10775 :  you hear about people with google glass being attacked

10776 :  so we already have cameras

10777 :  after a year of production theyre sold out

10778 :  there is no such thing as organic perrier you know

10779 :  fortythree thousand square feet thats an acre

10780 :  they drink water mixed with inorganic earth mineral molecules

10781 :  we used to be a net exporter of fruits and vegetables and we are now a net importer of fruits and vegetables

10782 :  i was captivated

10783 :  if we can think different

10784 :  states cities and communities need to start thinking like these progressive countries around greenhouse farming

10785 :  they harvest lettuce every twentyeight days

10786 :  china biggest in the world two
10787 :  selling produce to some of the finest restaurants in town

10788 :  its about learning about yourself how to take care of yourself

10789 :  this old fortress island off the coast of helsinki

10790 :  at this point some of my colleagues just went crazy

10791 :  that was too far for us so we ask our boss in jyv skyl if she could do the snooping for us

10792 :  and we did that

10793 :  hence our guiding principle and theme for the day

10794 :  a project of this nature would not have been possible without someone of delias stature spearheading our efforts

10795 :  a true visionary by the name of delia cohen introduced us to the ted philosophy

10796 :  a philosophy rooted in the belief that freely shared and worthy ideas has the potential to change lives

10797 :  so thank you for that

10798 :  they couldnt see the person i truly was

10799 :  the third component is mindfulness

10800 :  you have to consider all the factors in all the circumstances before considering yourself a failure in comparison to

10801 :  as a result the second component is common humanity which involves eliminating the mentality

10802 :  i found that empowerment through self compassion

10803 :  she stayed true to who she was no matter what the whole world was telling her she was

10804 :  humans tend to exaggerate their failures and criticize themselves more

10805 :  however if we find ourselves being the victims of such labels remember that we do have the power to

10806 :  as the time passed i began to ask myself

10807 :  humiliation is an emotion felt by every single person no matter their race their

10808 :  we invest in broadband and science education and science grants but we invest far too little

10809 :  in fact many people told us it was illegal

10810 :  it doesnt get anybody to do anything with that data to change lives to solve problems and it doesnt

10811 :  then in the 19th century we layer on the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state to help us govern complex

10812 :  we have a precedent for this

10813 :  obviously opening up the data is one but the important thing is to create lots more create and

10814 :  now what were seeing lots of examples of obviously is the opening up of government data not enough examples of this

10815 :  there was no legal precedent no cultural precedent no technical way of doing this

10816 :  we wanted naturally to ask public sector employees how we should open up government

10817 :  not in a passive society a read only society but in a writable society where we have the

10818 :  and we know that the smartest person always works for someone else

10819 :  it opens up the api to allow hundreds of thousands of new applications to be built on top of it

10820 :  because it opens up its platform

10821 :  turns out that had never been done before

10822 :  there is a hero in all of us is their slogan

10823 :  they cannot replace government

10824 :  you can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time let alone generate real palpable innovations that improve

10825 :  neighbors came and went

10826 :  russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together as is lithuania

10827 :  its also about creating government

10828 :  its not only the benefits that weve talked about with regard to development

10829 :  theyre not fun enough

10830 :  its the economic benefits and the job creation thats coming from this open innovation

10831 :  simply throwing data over the transom doesnt change how government works

10832 :  friending someone on facebook is not complex enough to do the hard work of you and i collaborating

10833 :  theyre not exciting enough to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity that awaits us

10834 :  when we start to see power over the core functions of government spending legislation

10835 :  weve heard talk here at ted about people biohacking and hacking their plants with

10836 :  i ended up being interviewed for television and radio and blogs and podcasts

10837 :  and that just made me so curious to know more about this man and who he had been in his life up

10838 :  so im multitasking from the time i wake up to the time i go to bed and i am always pressed for time

10839 :  vincent which is a retirement home in west seattle and the intergenerational learning center which is the

10840 :  so on our way they were coaching us and they explained that the residents were gonna be super excited to see us

10841 :  the story got picked up by news outlets all over the world

10842 :  its been in this particular location for almost twentyfive years

10843 :  doubtfire for example things like that

10844 :  just get whatever anybody wants

10845 :  i needed to head towards conservation goals

10846 :  so find your passion not something i care about not something the person sitting next to you cares

10847 :  when we choose not to give we are cutting off somebody elses opportunities and therefore were

10848 :  youve got to see it

10849 :  because its important that boys play with and as female superheroes just as my daughter

10850 :  and we were very excited

10851 :  theres over one
10852 :  got a great example for you

10853 :  why did you do it once

10854 :  its about cartography

10855 :  the way that we choose to sort of our personal cartographic enterprise also shapes the

10856 :  i believe that what we map changes the life we lead

10857 :  it was spotty it was inconsistent there was a lot i didnt know

10858 :  were going to sue your pants off

10859 :  it is a fake place

10860 :  why would i want to jump over all these hurdles and have that be the end

10861 :  they literally put nooses on themselves and then they went off to their jobs whatever they were

10862 :  and i said i dont know like six hours

10863 :  its true that i had teachers that didnt give up on me and i was very fortunate to have those teachers because i often gave

10864 :  its a paper town

10865 :  what is the process of cartography

10866 :  heres ze talking about las vegas

10867 :  we made agloe new york up

10868 :  they all have more than half a million views on youtube

10869 :  todays question is why

10870 :  and thats when learning really began for me

10871 :  question why did i travel

10872 :  but why did i travel all around the world without hopping on a single plane

10873 :  what about stability

10874 :  i remember looking up how much a typical designer makes and thinking how can i afford a nice

10875 :  im talking about inequality we have as citizens

10876 :  blacks can vote in the general elections if of course they could get registered given all the barriers to registration

10877 :  going back to the example of nutrition

10878 :  they have the most developed mitochondria of any human

10879 :  in the mitochondria as well

10880 :  we know thats not true

10881 :  theyre not going to do that right

10882 :  dentists love them by the way

10883 :  elite endurance athletes

10884 :  the main reason is exercise

10885 :  so they have an amazing mitochondria

10886 :  thats the gold standard thats the only way we can be healthy and lose weight

10887 :  and thats very important to know

10888 :  and thats a reference for example

10889 :  were not changing

10890 :  if you go in this country in the u

10891 :  so its what i think

10892 :  we have no idea

10893 :  einstein said that we cannot solve a problem with the same intelligence we had when we created it

10894 :  im not against that industry of course but if you havent exercised in recent memory thats

10895 :  and for that elite endurance athletes is the way to go

10896 :  and that causes mitochondrial dysfunction

10897 :  it is not re rewriting history

10898 :  babbling through every silence in the conversation talking about the weather and the terrain

10899 :  and what better way than writing a book

10900 :  if youve ever read a chick flick book before set in a high school setting chances are the author has already passed that

10901 :  all my thoughts raised to my mind from keybord to page

10902 :  they buy products on demand

10903 :  still i think youll find that norway is a country with a strong social capital base which i think is

10904 :  i think that is wrong

10905 :  because they may turn out to be a majority

10906 :  right now the discussion goes

10907 :  and he told me

10908 :  and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising

10909 :  how are we going to solve climate change through negotiations unless we are able to make civil society and

10910 :  we didnt grasp what was going on

10911 :  to me and to my family

10912 :  it was black or white

10913 :  and when that responsibility is diffused between a whole network of researchers academics

10914 :  but it turned out that i was misled

10915 :  and then they went to see if these trials had been published in the peer reviewed academic literature

10916 :  we cannot know the true effects of the medicines that we prescribe if we do not

10917 :  if i flipped a coin one hundred times but then withheld the results from you from half of those

10918 :  these drugs were brought to market

10919 :  forty seven out of those fiftythree were unreplicable

10920 :  that would mean that i was a chancer lg

10921 :  and this is what they found

10922 :  we wont publish any journals we wont publish any trials unless theyve been registered before they began

10923 :  and so then the international committee of medical journal editors came along and they said oh well we will hold the line

10924 :  fifty patients got lorcainide and of those patients ten died

10925 :  the results were unavailable to them

10926 :  but that wouldnt mean that i had a two headed coin

10927 :  were not interested in your negative data

10928 :  but people didnt bother to use those registers

10929 :  im fourteen im becoming a juggler

10930 :  they play the little high school kid games with each other

10931 :  s want to talk and flirt with the female c

10932 :  this way the public foundation is owned by nobody

10933 :  can we use it to make a drug

10934 :  so we put him in the lab and he could start to make drugs

10935 :  i think you have a chemistry lab

10936 :  we have to do something different

10937 :  the cancer is gone

10938 :  i have a drug developer

10939 :  we wont get any help from the big pharmas

10940 :  we can really make a difference

10941 :  one roll of the dice would tell you very little but the more times you rolled them the more data you

10942 :  three years to find fortytwo supernovae by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies

10943 :  we expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade

10944 :  about the evolution of our universe

10945 :  im also inspired by my commitment to help women thrive not just for themselves but in

10946 :  ariana thought about it and bolted upright in bed

10947 :  she said i have to go

10948 :  maryanne in her wise way sat down and rubbed her daughters back and she said its okay honey you dont have to go

10949 :  when we give ourselves the choice between yes or no

10950 :  and either choice would have been fine for ariana she could have gone or not

10951 :  are you ready to leave the straight path behind

10952 :  it was the day of her eight year old daughters recital and she found ariana sobbing hysterically on the bed

10953 :  it isnt about destination its about navigating lifes waves so that

10954 :  every muscle seared in my body

10955 :  one question for you

10956 :  we are very very fortunate here in the rochester area to have three outstanding business

10957 :  i asked myself why

10958 :  in two thousand and five i graduated from st

10959 :  and one thing that i want to focus on is a potentially powerful role of external security researchers

10960 :  we are going to be persistent we are going to keep coming and coming and coming

10961 :  at the same time im also trying to assess a potentially powerful pathway to improve that

10962 :  or have they been very inadequately prepared

10963 :  so the question arises

10964 :  so what does it mean

10965 :  so what i want to do in the following is to delve a little bit deeper into the data to give you some additional insights

10966 :  last year facebook released a new web messenger app that actually included an implementation mistake

10967 :  let me illustrate this problem of this well motivated well capable attacker by using a quote from

10968 :  so rediscovery can be happening very quickly and it can be a very powerful mean

10969 :  but still this does not include the kind of breaches that you dont know about at all

10970 :  after all they asked for the involvement of the white hat researchers

10971 :  so what we need given just this sub selection of reasons is really a multifaceted approach to address

10972 :  what we are also doing is to work on making the information that we are collecting presentable and

10973 :  oftentimes its quite sensitive data

10974 :  the program or participation model of wooyun is much broader in this sense

10975 :  and within minutes of releasing this particular application fifteen different white hats had already

10976 :  for this kind of purpose this data can be very valuable

10977 :  so doing these interactions we are sharing a lot of data about ourselves

10978 :  and if this process repeats over and over again then we are hoping that at the end of the day

10979 :  so thats good

10980 :  almost all of large companies and the majority of small businesses are now offering web services to their

10981 :  but first the bad news

10982 :  at the same time it is necessary to then also preempt the activities of black hats

10983 :  and we still see there that white hat researchers do a lot of work and submitting a large number of different

10984 :  at the same time we also see on hackerone and mostly on wooyun a lot of programs that do not

10985 :  on the other hand on wooyun we see the opposite

10986 :  how well are these companies actually safeguarding our information

10987 :  another issue that we find interesting is to explore the different behavioral patterns of these white hat researchers

10988 :  on the other hand we have wooyun where any hacker can submit any kind of vulnerability about any

10989 :  we see that there are a lot of companies are coerced to participate through the submissions of white hat researchers

10990 :  finally the question arises

10991 :  given these different participation patterns our explanation is that indeed the organizations are better prepared

10992 :  we watched as he turned that company into a global dynamo of it

10993 :  when many of us think about innovation though we think about an einstein having an aha

10994 :  the final capability is creative resolution

10995 :  so they began to work on that

10996 :  how did he see his role

10997 :  but we all know thats a myth

10998 :  because that animator was allowed to share what we refer to as his slice of genius he was able

10999 :  we ended up with pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what

11000 :  creative abrasion is not about brainstorming where people suspend their judgment

11001 :  but as the process unfolded he began to understand the wisdom of allowing talented people to play out

11002 :  in the twenty years hence theyve produced fourteen movies

11003 :  its because they have mastered the capabilities required for that

11004 :  we studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers

11005 :  but very few of you recognized ed catmull the founder and ceo of pixar one of the

11006 :  on the contrary it takes about two hundred and fifty people four to five years to make one of those

11007 :  my job is to nurture the bottom up and not let it degenerate into chaos

11008 :  they stopped giving answers they stopped trying to provide solutions

11009 :  early in that process one of the engineers had gone to bill and said were all too busy for this inefficient

11010 :  what do they focus their time on

11011 :  lets think for a minute about what it takes to make a pixar movie

11012 :  two weeks later the director came back and said lets put in those few seconds of film

11013 :  when the director saw that drawing he thought it was great

11014 :  if some of you are worrying now that you dont work at a pixar or you dont work at a google i want to tell you theres still hope

11015 :  lets put in a policy that anyone no matter what their level or role is allowed to give notes to the director about how

11016 :  im never a dictator of viewpoints

11017 :  as the need for a solution became more urgent and as the data or the evidence began to come

11018 :  he admitted if you had forced us to all be on one team we might have focused on proving who was right

11019 :  let me give you another example

11020 :  but if we want to build organizations that can innovate time and again we must recast our understanding of what leadership

11021 :  when we met vineet his company was about in his words to become irrelevant

11022 :  they want to co create with me the future

11023 :  computer generated movies are really mainstream today but it took ed and his colleagues nearly twenty years to

11024 :  pilots are often about being right

11025 :  they dont all go through in order

11026 :  they also learn how to advocate for their point of view

11027 :  it can be a process or a way of organizing

11028 :  this is about doing decision making in a way that you can combine even opposable ideas to

11029 :  so they selected that one

11030 :  its about running a series of experiments and not a series of pilots

11031 :  they understand that innovation rarely happens unless you have both diversity and

11032 :  separately these two teams were allowed to work full time on their particular approach

11033 :  its about discovery driven learning where you act as opposed to plan your way to the future

11034 :  when they dont work someone or something is to blame

11035 :  partway through one production an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a

11036 :  not on creating a vision

11037 :  the head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named bill coughran

11038 :  in engineering reviews bill described his role as injecting honesty into the process

11039 :  and that example is the infrastructure group of google

11040 :  they dont let one group or one individual dominate even if its the boss even if

11041 :  instead of creating a group to tackle this task they decided to allow groups to emerge

11042 :  just after the election in november the south african artist william kentridge with whom id spent a lot of time

11043 :  america needs my attention now

11044 :  and she came up with what she referred to when talking to me as her three point program

11045 :  we must take action as citizens of our countries yet embrace the larger

11046 :  i would invite them into my hut and fill it with steam and within minutes they were holding out their hands

11047 :  they said weve got our hands full with infectious diseases

11048 :  so they fall in the same way independent of their mass

11049 :  what is the hidden structure underlying the geometry of space time which was smooth

11050 :  i want to explain to you actually what this theory is

11051 :  to one part in ten ten actually

11052 :  is there something below it that we are not seeing not experiencing but which actually holds the whole thing

11053 :  what is the hidden structure

11054 :  much before we actually knew really of the existence of atoms

11055 :  its not that ill do something here and then this response

11056 :  i will tell you what a black hole is

11057 :  thats a great law of nature

11058 :  that is a black hole

11059 :  it just was like a ton of bricks that were dropped on my chest

11060 :  you know maybe it wasnt the same as what we all envisioned but it was his own accommodation tool

11061 :  so i started working for this nonprofit resource center for people with disabilities and i took one internship

11062 :  and so i took my own advice and i started sharing it with other people and saying sometimes self accommodation

11063 :  it sounds a lot weirder when i say that out loud

11064 :  and i work with students who also have disabilities and help them set up accommodation plans so that they can be

11065 :  i was brought to the emergency room and at the emergency room my parents were told by the doctors to start preparing for the

11066 :  i could have gone in any number of different directions and oftentimes i did

11067 :  i wanted to find out what i wanted to do with my life

11068 :  at the same time i blossomed

11069 :  and my masterpiece in my life is actually my deafness

11070 :  i didnt know what to do where to go

11071 :  and so i talked to my friends and i said is this okay for me to do

11072 :  and at the university i do disability services

11073 :  would you have any problems

11074 :  college was a game changer for me

11075 :  i dont know how long its going to be

11076 :  i didnt know what i was going to do

11077 :  im going to travel the world

11078 :  they are maybe making eight nine ten dollars an hour

11079 :  we waste a lot of time

11080 :  what she was kind of saying is

11081 :  i document what these groups do when theyre not shooting

11082 :  imagine the sails of the sydney opera as power plants

11083 :  these two compounds are mixed and dissolved to become an ink

11084 :  the resulting thin layer is the active layer absorbing the energy of the sun

11085 :  they just dont match

11086 :  they do offer a good cost performance ratio but they arent really flexible in terms of their design and this makes

11087 :  todays situation is more like my other shoe

11088 :  thats a stable and healthy condition

11089 :  i hope organic photovoltaics will be a big part of this

11090 :  this is the reason why we dont see many solar cells on buildings today

11091 :  they provided shading during the day and electricity for the lighting in the evening

11092 :  you may wonder why this hexagonal shape was chosen for the solar cells

11093 :  thats two seconds

11094 :  i actually had a front row seat

11095 :  and boy did secretariat run his race

11096 :  wilson and i realized its really not

11097 :  well what hes saying is look at the flight of the ball

11098 :  wilson and i have been friends for a long time

11099 :  how is it going to react

11100 :  that is what makes deliberate practice so difficult because its tedious and painful

11101 :  theyre superhuman these men and women

11102 :  and then your choices and your decisions are all based upon what you have just determined

11103 :  and he said it was like a locomotive going down the back stretch and around the

11104 :  wilson with me

11105 :  a lot of us want to lose weight

11106 :  and thats what i want to share with you

11107 :  and i want to know

11108 :  think about how hard that could be

11109 :  theyre always creating new challenges for themselves

11110 :  its about a competitive mindset

11111 :  michael geller would say to jordan spieth paint a picture

11112 :  even jordan spieth the number one golfer in the world youve probably heard now with technology their

11113 :  he kept on going

11114 :  and a lot of people say winning

11115 :  no its not about vanquishing an opponent

11116 :  he said i was here for a ride

11117 :  one of the tenets is

11118 :  but if you do it youll be successful in what you want to accomplish

11119 :  the other is deliberate practice

11120 :  so theyre always breaking down new barriers

11121 :  thats unheard of in horse racing

11122 :  now theres a lady that inspired me and it was a tremendous story

11123 :  and then i went on to college and obviously played college basketball

11124 :  he would feel the wind on his back and he would keep on walking along

11125 :  what deliberate practice is is using something in your fundamentals to build upon

11126 :  let me give you an example

11127 :  what would you do if you were in that situation

11128 :  and hes been by my side ever since

11129 :  this is a more powerful tool that we can use in our daily lives

11130 :  get out of your comfort zone

11131 :  so what he would do for four hours is play his golf course back home

11132 :  well he didnt want to give up hope

11133 :  put on the dress see yourself in the mirror

11134 :  but he did this every day

11135 :  before i shot a free throw i would actually and you can take the time if you want to follow with me is

11136 :  theyre always about winning

11137 :  but guess what

11138 :  eat the food that you need to do because when you come back youve already created an imprint of what

11139 :  and the third part is

11140 :  if youre going to a job interview visualize whats going to happen in the job interview

11141 :  how many of you want to lose weight

11142 :  i do this though painting sculpture video and performance

11143 :  i showed him a photo of a lynching postcard from the early 1900s and reminded him that these killings have been going

11144 :  only recently have i figured out how to use this in my own work

11145 :  moms cuddling them all the time tying their shoes driving them to soccer practice every day

11146 :  if your genetics is the hardware your epigenetics is the software or the operating

11147 :  i sought to change the way women viewed themselves and their hair

11148 :  i am sure many others

11149 :  they walked in and they saw a bullet hole had gone through the chalkboard the

11150 :  she said that i was talking about boys and kissing and much like what happened in south central moms oh

11151 :  she moved us to westchester california which is only three miles away

11152 :  i remember my mom put me in summer camp and i came home from summer camp i got in the

11153 :  oh you want me to play this

11154 :  money goes even larger amounts nbsp for litigation

11155 :  through mark ups

11156 :  that repeats for ten years and at the end of the ten years your product goes generic so you

11157 :  data exclusivity and so on

11158 :  and these marketing battles of course are a pure waste because what one company spends to get patients over to their drug another

11159 :  thats in stark contrast to the existing system where you get a lot of money for switching somebody from

11160 :  and then there is counterfeiting in the developing countries

11161 :  so the rate will always be at a reasonable level

11162 :  thats how they make their money

11163 :  we want them to aim for the greatest health impact

11164 :  you all know how exit polling works and this is a similar method

11165 :  a lot of money goes to take our patents into all the different jurisdictions

11166 :  so what can we do

11167 :  a lot of money goes for gaming where brand name companies pay generic companies to delay

11168 :  a lot of the money that pharmaceutical companies make goes into advertising campaigns trying to win favor

11169 :  deadweight losses i wont even tell you what they are because its too complicated

11170 :  you pay with one hand through the tax system but you get something back with the other hand because you

11171 :  and vice versa

11172 :  they have a choice

11173 :  a lot of the drugs there often more than fifty percent of whats sold are counterfeit drugs where people say because the

11174 :  if we did it all over again how would you do it

11175 :  now if you take that reward from the health impact fund you cant claim the other reward

11176 :  this is not just for poor people

11177 :  how can we change the system

11178 :  they would be replaced

11179 :  today most packaged inserts are not even translated into local languages and so its not

11180 :  and with each particular medicine they have their choice

11181 :  people say pharmaceutical companies make a lot of profit

11182 :  now how would the financing work

11183 :  so some people before the medicine came along had no treatment at all now for the first time they have treatment because

11184 :  the health impact fund does not pay for that

11185 :  but now that i am actually smack dab in the middle of my own third act i realize ive

11186 :  if we can go back and redefine ourselves and become whole this will

11187 :  this potential is not for the lucky few

11188 :  it wastes the body but the mind remains intact

11189 :  you see if you have over time reacted negatively to past events and people neural

11190 :  we have agency

11191 :  we tend to see commonalities more than differences

11192 :  selinger wrote the following to describe what was happening to him

11193 :  who were my grandparents

11194 :  and guess what

11195 :  and youre able to go back and forgive them

11196 :  and if we can do that it will not just be for ourselves

11197 :  what is the appropriate new metaphor for aging

11198 :  neil selinger to me is the embodiment of mounting the staircase in his third act

11199 :  i thought oh my gosh

11200 :  i mean as girls were feisty yeah

11201 :  and over time these neural pathways become hardwired

11202 :  but who was i

11203 :  if however we can go back and alter our relationship re

11204 :  and i got scared

11205 :  obviously theres no guarantee that it can be a time of fruition and growth

11206 :  i dont want to romanticize aging

11207 :  they become the norm even if its bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety

11208 :  and we become the subjects and objects of other peoples lives

11209 :  its like resetting a thermostat

11210 :  its reflecting on the experiences that weve had that makes us wise and that helps us

11211 :  we are the subjects of our own lives

11212 :  perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain a wound

11213 :  how did they treat my parents

11214 :  now while i was writing about this i came upon a book called mans search for meaning by viktor

11215 :  which of the people would be ok and which would not

11216 :  older women are the largest demographic in the world

11217 :  women start off whole dont we

11218 :  age as potential

11219 :  about three years ago i read an article in the new york times

11220 :  viktor frankl was a german psychiatrist whod spent five years in a nazi concentration camp

11221 :  you realize youre still yourself maybe even more so

11222 :  and there isnt much we can do about that

11223 :  how do we live it successfully

11224 :  in this article mr

11225 :  perhaps we feel that many of our relationships have not had closure

11226 :  were going to discuss what we can do to make these added years really successful and

11227 :  perhaps our parents suffered from depression

11228 :  now let me say something about the staircase which may seem like an odd metaphor for

11229 :  two years later he was diagnosed with als commonly known as lou gehrigs disease

11230 :  picasso once said it takes a long time to become young

11231 :  and if we can maintain the more positive feelings about the past that becomes the

11232 :  but very often many if not most of us when we hit puberty we start worrying about fitting in and being

11233 :  perhaps they werent able to love us beyond how we performed in the world

11234 :  and he wrote that while he was in the camp he could tell should they ever be

11235 :  thats the metaphor the old metaphor

11236 :  we need more observations to understand these processes more

11237 :  he is my doctor

11238 :  in the book my name is celia

11239 :  so much so that she wrote to dr gabor mat to thank him

11240 :  i cried because i recognized for the first time that homelessness is not just about a lack of housing

11241 :  despite the fact that he wakes up in vancouvers alleyways its nothing compared to the hell he endured in

11242 :  as i drove home that night i cried

11243 :  and the person who didnt it turned out had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job

11244 :  so you know people were writing me and saying hows your new job

11245 :  and so i said lets put this together in an album

11246 :  this was at a distance realizing that someone was feeling something wanting to affect them in a particular way

11247 :  i was like i dont know

11248 :  this was incredible this is what i wanted to do

11249 :  this was connecting right

11250 :  and thats the challenge we face getting everybody out of poverty and coming back within what

11251 :  unpaid care economy

11252 :  now this blew my mind because there were times when i was young i used to worry so much as a teenager i

11253 :  the barber said to me kinja you are taking this very very well

11254 :  i decided to send a text are you ok

11255 :  move forward with your action plan

11256 :  i stepped out of the vehicle and i started my process

11257 :  i got a text back im tired

11258 :  i took a deep breath

11259 :  how can you turn this pain into positive production

11260 :  thats what i want to get rid of

11261 :  now there was a time i would have handled this all wrong

11262 :  one there can be no middle man

11263 :  and people just blindly trust that company

11264 :  we want it to be transparent

11265 :  once that happens and i want to talk to a friend i want to send a massage that communication is between

11266 :  not any other company

11267 :  you are talking to the right facebook

11268 :  and these companies that issue security certificates

11269 :  for that im proposing two requirements

11270 :  we want an internet that is fair

11271 :  you can have your own storage space online

11272 :  you dont need passwords anymore

11273 :  that hey im on the secure internet

11274 :  the main thing that it does is that it gives the power back to the people

11275 :  he didnt have to go through any company at all

11276 :  where is cnn

11277 :  this private key is so secure that if someone wants to randomly guess it or crack it they would need

11278 :  farmers are coming out of poverty

11279 :  so leds are fantastic

11280 :  we will go all in

11281 :  and weve decided in the next three years we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business

11282 :  so lets take an example measure the things that are important in your business

11283 :  so think about that

11284 :  i worked on development and agriculture issues in the u

11285 :  its really dirty in production

11286 :  probably many people are wearing cotton right now

11287 :  we also have a foundation thats committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the

11288 :  the electricity is free

11289 :  they produced heat and a little bit of light on the side

11290 :  actually we found one hundred percent is easier to do than ninety percent or fifty percent

11291 :  can i pay the bills at the end of the month

11292 :  it felt like we were buying ourselves time

11293 :  we were eking things out a bit longer

11294 :  and yet our speed that weve used these materials has increased rapidly exponentially

11295 :  there is no more

11296 :  we knew exactly where we were headed

11297 :  even if everybody changed it wouldnt solve the problem

11298 :  these figures couldnt be exact but we knew those materials were finite

11299 :  eight sail changes in twelve hours

11300 :  that is my goal today but what i will do is try to give you some tools

11301 :  so what is the significance of this

11302 :  how about this

11303 :  what i would like to do is use some examples today from the martial art of ki aikido to give you an

11304 :  and one of those addictions is the habit of separating your mind and body together

11305 :  ok whats happening here

11306 :  thats the problem

11307 :  and your whole world changes

11308 :  ready for this one

11309 :  how about this in athletics

11310 :  the experts say about thirty days

11311 :  im going to ask derek to concentrate on the physiological center of his body

11312 :  i had that experience

11313 :  keep one point

11314 :  ill give you an image to make that more clear

11315 :  i can make the point very simply by talking about your daily life experience

11316 :  stuckness is hard wired in us

11317 :  how many people does it take to have an argument

11318 :  hold out your hand as tight as you can

11319 :  how about this

11320 :  i will give you an example

11321 :  anyway thats my goal

11322 :  i would propose to you not only is your mind and body one but you are one with the universe

11323 :  you just do not pay attention to it

11324 :  something about this deserves some attention here

11325 :  that is what derek did when he walked right into my hand

11326 :  even though we tend to be in the habit of separating our mind and body i can share with you a

11327 :  how many of you are thinking right now about your heart beating

11328 :  so guess what you now know those conditions where youre not operating to the best of your ability

11329 :  i am going to try and resist with my body

11330 :  you know why

11331 :  and it might just seem like that just like fiction

11332 :  and project tango is a project by google

11333 :  im like oh thats funny

11334 :  i was having a whale of a time

11335 :  i was the only one to think that

11336 :  there isnt much sharing there

11337 :  we need the professionals to change that

11338 :  i found that that was home

11339 :  also there were lots of great speakers

11340 :  when you think about it when a surgeon makes a mistake he kills the patient thats in front

11341 :  we need to make two changes to the way we think and incorporate engineers

11342 :  when i left high school and i came to university i brought that model along with me

11343 :  my facial expression didnt change at all

11344 :  i was being taught in french and english all the time

11345 :  and it was just him speaking

11346 :  and for the way in which im going to present the data i want to thank ted community superstar hans

11347 :  why has television entertainment evolved the way it has

11348 :  we talked to over three thousand individuals almost three thousand six hundred aged eighteen to seventy and we

11349 :  the other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained

11350 :  were talking about popular tv

11351 :  s most popular shows are exported around the world

11352 :  and on a factual basis over eighty percent of the u

11353 :  there has not been a decade of television without a definitive dominant tv mom

11354 :  that is separate and apart from the animal kingdom

11355 :  the socially irreverent hippie show rowan and martins laugh in

11356 :  they in fact berate it

11357 :  one basic instinct remains

11358 :  and thats where the tragedy starts

11359 :  and he said

11360 :  i didnt want it to happen but it did

11361 :  he was thoughtful

11362 :  i hope thats the perspective youll take with you today cause ladies and gentlemen youre about to see an amazing array of

11363 :  half the team showed

11364 :  but youre also bright and you know not everyone does

11365 :  it had been there every day but i missed it every day until now

11366 :  he said when i realized that and a new lens clicked in place i saw something right there in front of me

11367 :  enjoy this event

11368 :  the same half a team showed up almost to a person and the same guy gave dave the same

11369 :  i learned to get over myself

11370 :  i broke through

11371 :  it blew my mind that people were willing to forgive me for something that i considered unforgivable

11372 :  those two worlds started crashing together and there was nothing i could do to stop it

11373 :  that group made me confront the reality of who i am and what id done

11374 :  once i was smoking crack nothing else mattered

11375 :  many years ago

11376 :  i journaled about my feelings and things i wanted to say to my victim

11377 :  myrna heard about my arrest and she contacted me

11378 :  i could never forget

11379 :  my increasing level of depravity was fueled by drugs and alcohol

11380 :  create your own path of healing and redemption

11381 :  i knew he loved me

11382 :  i would never have been able to write such an honest introspective letter had i not done all the

11383 :  that sparked something inside of me

11384 :  forgiving myself doesnt mean that i forget

11385 :  i felt dead inside like my soul was gone

11386 :  new friends like ginger would listen to me cry in those early days when i couldnt imagine telling

11387 :  a lot of friends helped me along the way

11388 :  i have hope for the future

11389 :  it was gut wrenching work but necessary for my survival

11390 :  may god bless you

11391 :  i had graduated from college

11392 :  i didnt correct people when they made that assumption

11393 :  i had to come to a place of acceptance

11394 :  i started to believe that maybe there was hope for me

11395 :  and before she passed away she worked the steps with me

11396 :  i knew his hopes and his dreams for the future

11397 :  at first i couldnt even say my victims name but i knew i had to face what id done

11398 :  im not the same person i used to be

11399 :  it was easy to allow people to think it was all my co defendants fault

11400 :  my friends were helping me to come to terms with who i was my addiction my

11401 :  my physical mental and spiritual health are valuable to me

11402 :  but i was allowing a wall of denial to build up around my crime and why i

11403 :  it wasnt until i participated in a violence prevention group that that wall of denial

11404 :  over the next few years people were placed in my life for reasons that i couldnt understand at the time

11405 :  im engaged in life and i live with intention and deliberateness

11406 :  mailing that letter freed something in me

11407 :  they want to find their relatives or maybe meet the black sheep in their family

11408 :  so my lab conducted an empirical test

11409 :  when scientists access the dna in these biobanks they dont get the name or contact

11410 :  without biobanks we would not be able to help ariela

11411 :  and eventually we found a match to another y chromosome

11412 :  and i wanted to try to hack it and to see if i can breach the privacy of these participants

11413 :  but i found that we have biobanks

11414 :  grit is a concept developed by dr

11415 :  we need grit

11416 :  the company has also hired a spokesperson

11417 :  theyre all buying off the shelf stuff

11418 :  in the last year or so the company has opened a sales office in

11419 :  theyd sent them an invoice for a sale but the egyptians never bought it

11420 :  so governments around the world have been embracing this technology

11421 :  ive been studying surveillance for more than six years

11422 :  as i said its a five billion industry

11423 :  the two thousand and eleven arab spring captured the attention of the world

11424 :  men were seeing something different were seeing a pink car in the middle of the racing track

11425 :  i was lucky to find many girls in different schools that continue helping me manage the project and i

11426 :  the phenomena started again

11427 :  lets make our uniforms pink

11428 :  that is true

11429 :  i was really nervous obviously

11430 :  in this group there was somebody named ronnie

11431 :  we cant take anything from you anymore

11432 :  he said yeah i have a place to entertain now

11433 :  you have to you have to

11434 :  i don t know if there are cowboys

11435 :  i said a chimpanzee

11436 :  he had one positive attribute

11437 :  i d gotten a divorce i nbsp had no money i was in new york city i had two very small children

11438 :  nobody talked to ronnie

11439 :  we dont know what we want

11440 :  no magical new age way it echoes in practical wonderful ways

11441 :  i said a woman

11442 :  but he never wanted anything

11443 :  she nbsp remembered her roommate had an uncle in alberta who was a rancher

11444 :  and he found somebody

11445 :  and so i just gave up

11446 :  ive got to rent a chimp

11447 :  he said yeah if you had steak this month somewhere theres a cowboy

11448 :  somebody looked at them and said what a pair of dingbats

11449 :  i really am because it s all about dreams and that s what it s all about and no kidding that s

11450 :  and he was very nbsp valuable

11451 :  we had to walk him home nbsp after the group but we were used to him we liked him

11452 :  what are you talking nbsp about

11453 :  we had a group with six people there were five women and this guy

11454 :  she said my brother has a big stand of those in australia

11455 :  come back here i ll give you his number

11456 :  you want to rent

11457 :  and he said i m nbsp sorry

11458 :  a woman raised her hand and said patrick swayzes mother has a resort thirty miles away i work there weekends

11459 :  he went out he became a cowboy and he does his toronto accounts on the internet

11460 :  finally they said listen you have to tell us what you want

11461 :  i said what

11462 :  and they brightened up

11463 :  we ve got trainers too

11464 :  every time you make someone else s dream come true it echoes

11465 :  her daughters going to become a teacher

11466 :  they just don t get treated

11467 :  well that s what i call him

11468 :  i couldn t get a day care center so i couldn t take a job

11469 :  okay why don t you guys go out get a village voice and find him an apartment we ll have a painting party i ll bring a

11470 :  we got innocent visiting cousins from ohio and we had the party

11471 :  then they were done they hugged each other they walked out of the room they were so happy

11472 :  she said yes

11473 :  but hell it was ronnie and so we were very happy

11474 :  just out of politeness and he would always say i m fine

11475 :  we ve got everything

11476 :  i cant do it

11477 :  so heres what you do

11478 :  she came in dragged him in somebody had been working her dog nbsp had died and she was crying

11479 :  im going to teach you about wish and obstacle that is the secret

11480 :  it was a triumph

11481 :  they said okay and they nbsp did

11482 :  i would challenge you that when these events do happen you would continue to set high expectations for yourself

11483 :  she said it was expectations

11484 :  and these events will inevitably happen

11485 :  you have to have the best value

11486 :  of course thats the right way

11487 :  in the everglades they are the very architects of the everglades because as the water drops down in the

11488 :  it is resilient

11489 :  and i wanted that story to start in lake okeechobee the beating heart of the everglade system

11490 :  so i tried a few things

11491 :  it sounded wonderful this not having to read in order to play music

11492 :  government had found a powerful optimal tradeoff that in taking pictures at right about one meter

11493 :  why build these satellites

11494 :  in the late 1990s a couple of professors proposed a concept for radically reducing the

11495 :  im sure that now not only does he narrate about the corpses that lay below but also about the crazy

11496 :  in archetypes such as siren the voices that lure sailors to a watery grave or la

11497 :  i decided to become that black square

11498 :  did you have a break up

11499 :  they told me what was happening out in the world with six words ideas id never thought about

11500 :  i said look i have a new video camera

11501 :  and then he started reading encyclopedias from cover to cover

11502 :  the first direct rays shook my mind

11503 :  my daily commute a one kilometer trudge through the icy blackness from station to telescope

11504 :  the air at the south pole dries everything

11505 :  another is a desert because water vapor moisture absorbs microwave light

11506 :  from the farthest side modern humans dont exist the earth as seen has not evolved us

11507 :  i was in poly speak toasty

11508 :  it desiccates your skin turning it papery and fragile so that it tears when you reach in a pocket and then

11509 :  they let us see the entire history of existence laid bare before our eyes

11510 :  i mean weve watched it happen

11511 :  they were looking back in time one
11512 :  and this may help us promote better health outcomes

11513 :  and this results in an emotional response and a biological adaptation such as

11514 :  so we really need to encourage the policy makers to take stress seriously and put it upon the

11515 :  so stress is something of an event that is out of our control that we feel we cant cope with and causes a

11516 :  and in the individuals that have very little social support if you actually provide them with a support network their immune

11517 :  and we may be able to improve their immune function and improve their overall wellbeing

11518 :  put simply its a situation or an event that exceeds or is perceived to exceed

11519 :  you can imagine that the types of stresses we face in the modern world are very different to our cavemen

11520 :  this means they are under regulation of the sympathetic nervous system during stress

11521 :  so its a good thing its our fight and flight response it promotes the survival of the

11522 :  but if not we become stressed

11523 :  these are some of the biggest killers currently in society

11524 :  only the soldiers of the immune system respond

11525 :  and we need to engage the policy makers

11526 :  its associated with some of the most common diseases facing the modern world such

11527 :  so how does the physiological response to stress manifest in the modern era

11528 :  but despite this and despite the fact that stress management is easy and affordable to

11529 :  it promotes a protection against infections

11530 :  and grandma moses god love her didnt start painting until she was seventysix years old proving that there is hope for

11531 :  i can assure you that neither of these ladies are sitting at home in their rocking chair waiting to

11532 :  a couple of years ago ive snagged one of the last tickets to see willie nelson perform at the eisenman

11533 :  our views and our attitudes about aging are major indicators of how well

11534 :  third with the right use of shared technologies and an open

11535 :  please remember the time when you were playing hide and seek with your brothers and sisters and you were

11536 :  but none of us were experts in global health and we had no idea what sort of a medication we could fund raise for

11537 :  if children are taught to cultivate the creativity they are born with it will result in a generation of innovators

11538 :  i bought the curriculum and i learned it

11539 :  the hero of this story is a guy named micah true

11540 :  but i always thought that exercise was the best thing for my heart and i

11541 :  but that wasnt quite yet enough for me to own my own identity

11542 :  those were really broken glasses

11543 :  because stonewall was one of the first instances in american history where the lgbtq community said we will

11544 :  it was around this time that even though i didnt necessarily feel all that different from my peers other

11545 :  why would i fight

11546 :  im too tired

11547 :  why would i be out and even if i had all this history what good was that

11548 :  that was real tape

11549 :  we would rather own ourselves and use our identities to change the systems around us

11550 :  instead of expending his creative energy to change himself and to cover and to meet the standards that society wanted

11551 :  in its purest form what pride and what these students were doing was saying i am here for me

11552 :  because i was able to develop the vocabulary i started to see what it was that made me different than

11553 :  a dozen would have been nice but

11554 :  i blame you

11555 :  this was the outfit

11556 :  bush wouldnt have been as amenable to the project about how meth and gay sex could change the world

11557 :  i had to start working at a meth lab

11558 :  what good was it doing if i could still hide away

11559 :  georgetown by performing the first ever drag routine in gaston hall i think unless the judge

11560 :  unfortunately in two thousand and eleven when i was graduating in two thousand and ten when you searched georgetown

11561 :  i use my creative energies to bend the institution to accept people to accept identities

11562 :  this is unacceptable

11563 :  and so i understood that being out was not important just for myself it was not important just because of the debt that i owed to

11564 :  where was i going to go to college after bronx science

11565 :  very very different than albuquerque

11566 :  now weve restarted the colors

11567 :  i cant deal with that again

11568 :  and i knew that georgetown had a very rich history of lgbtq activism

11569 :  she has a huge imagination

11570 :  adults plan out every little second of their day before it happens

11571 :  do you ever wonder why

11572 :  kids dont plan things out

11573 :  did you know what

11574 :  he got to the sunday and something went wrong he was leading the field by six shots and on the

11575 :  or if he thinks what im saying is rubbish he wont do it

11576 :  they dont care

11577 :  so that was really interesting to me

11578 :  dont know why im looking at simon when i say that

11579 :  so youve got to get to grips with how people think about you about what youre saying about the world

11580 :  most performance appraisals in industry focus on what youve been doing

11581 :  thank you very much

11582 :  i think it was in the us masters sergio played brilliantly all week

11583 :  weve all got emotions every second of every day

11584 :  as though its a complete mystery why these things happen

11585 :  if you can get control over the whole thing you can crank out your a game every single day

11586 :  so we cant sell them on that

11587 :  its coming into your brain tell your brain whats going on in your gut right

11588 :  im going to talk to you about you and how you can be brilliant every single day

11589 :  so a big ask

11590 :  were going to have a bit of live demonstration of something

11591 :  if we measure hrv for twentyfour hours it can tell you how much energy youve got which is interesting to leaders because leaders need

11592 :  if we look at your heart rate over time well see that your heart rate will vary up and down

11593 :  the mouths dry

11594 :  given so many different signals where are we going to start

11595 :  a very good golfer sergio garcia was playing and hed been brilliant all week

11596 :  some of you are getting contractions around that cupcake so youve got pressure waves being created telling your brain about whats

11597 :  there is an energetic state going through us

11598 :  the energy may be there but we just dont feel it

11599 :  so some of you had the cupcake at the break and youll be getting a signal from your gut saying oh sugar

11600 :  youre just thinking what youre thinking and doing what youre doing

11601 :  so overnight hed lost ten shots on the same hole

11602 :  youve got to get to grips with whats on the inside of individuals

11603 :  but we may not all have feelings

11604 :  so im shouting at the television

11605 :  i spent the last fifteen years working with some of the best ceos and executives around the world

11606 :  i was sat on the couch at home watching the tv about five years ago

11607 :  i know i ought to make another thousand calls to a thousand customers but do you know what

11608 :  you go to see your boss and he said oh ive got some three hundred and sixty data

11609 :  if you want to change their thinking you have to change how they feel

11610 :  it will only make a difference if the leaders stood over that employee cracking the whip and making sure they do

11611 :  why would he

11612 :  actually i know why that happened and i know why sergio garcia

11613 :  whats happening in the mouth

11614 :  thats where the problem is

11615 :  but our view is if you dont get to grips and start to ask some more detailed questions you wont get a sustainable change in the

11616 :  but even if you did its not enough

11617 :  now people have a natural intuition about these trade offs

11618 :  it basically never happens

11619 :  thats how you think about security in terms of the trade off

11620 :  those tamper proof caps

11621 :  now theres often no right or wrong here

11622 :  really we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word

11623 :  models can come from industry

11624 :  i tell people if its in the news dont worry about it because by definition news is something that almost

11625 :  so evidence against our model were likely to ignore even if its compelling

11626 :  the question is was it worth it

11627 :  and we rely on others

11628 :  i visit her in the hospital

11629 :  youve heard in the past several years the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power

11630 :  if you dont understand the risks you dont understand the costs youre likely to get the trade off wrong and your

11631 :  a lot of times these trade offs are about more than just security and i think thats really important

11632 :  were terrible at models that span eighty years

11633 :  models are hard to dislodge

11634 :  it actually does

11635 :  and itll depend on where we live whether we live alone or have a family how much cool stuff we have

11636 :  a lot of good experiments in this

11637 :  ill give you the short answer

11638 :  but it made people feel better

11639 :  we dont know

11640 :  one thousand nine hundred and eightytwo i dont know if people will remember this there was a short epidemic of tylenol poisonings in the

11641 :  that came from this

11642 :  compare that to the secondhand smoke debate probably about twenty years behind

11643 :  strong feelings can create a model

11644 :  we rely on proxies

11645 :  and thats ok

11646 :  i go home i look it up

11647 :  its a horrific story

11648 :  that might be true but its not terribly relevant

11649 :  and there are two ways to do this

11650 :  it has to get very compelling before well pay attention

11651 :  we make them every day

11652 :  and language is actually a problem here

11653 :  whether this is a personal decision whether youre going to install a burglar alarm in your home or a national decision where youre going to invade

11654 :  there arent enough examples of failures

11655 :  all examples of models changing

11656 :  one mango two mangoes three mangoes ten thousand mangoes one hundred thousand mangoes its still more mangoes you can eat

11657 :  and theres some basic innumeracy going on

11658 :  i mean the joke one two three many is kind of right

11659 :  we live in a technological world reality changes all the time

11660 :  ill give you one a syringe

11661 :  and i call that their agenda

11662 :  its a model we just accept pretty much by faith

11663 :  this model is an intelligent representation of reality

11664 :  think of cancer bird flu swine flu sars

11665 :  im talking about cowboy boots and caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars the whole nine

11666 :  they try to legislate to try and force people like myself to use the bathroom that they deem

11667 :  we need food to eat

11668 :  what about folks with bodies who for whatever reason dont fit into the mainstream idea

11669 :  how many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front

11670 :  have you heard about these

11671 :  ive often been verbally attacked behind their doors

11672 :  they drop out of school or they opt out of life altogether

11673 :  and meanwhile our trans children suffer

11674 :  what about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there

11675 :  what about anyone with body image stuff going on

11676 :  ive been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up

11677 :  one time i asked her what her favorite color was

11678 :  and this is a great and necessary thing but most of that attention has been focused on a very few

11679 :  she was four years old

11680 :  then the crash came oh my gosh

11681 :  only three of people in poverty have jobs

11682 :  com a website and all you had to do in those days was be a website have dot com in your name if forbes

11683 :  now world imagine

11684 :  everything went on well

11685 :  a place in which we come together to bring all our diverse perspectives and

11686 :  if you can just go in the back they are all there

11687 :  you just pick out yours and you can go home

11688 :  and that sexuality is an essential part of who we are and its normal and

11689 :  our sexuality is a fundamental facet of our humanity

11690 :  thanks very much

11691 :  we have to make a world where whats between our legs and the way we use it is not used to create

11692 :  okay how about this one how about

11693 :  from the moment were born to the moment we die every minute of every day

11694 :  before i had time to process what was happening a hand was clapped around my mouth so that i could not breathe and the

11695 :  id read news reports statistics and knew how common sexual assault was yet i couldnt actually name a single person that id heard

11696 :  someone had hurt me and those who i loved under the assumption they wouldnt have to be held to account or recognize the damage they had caused

11697 :  its still an issue many people blame victims for

11698 :  my community will not feel we are unsafe walking home after dark

11699 :  i dont know who the people in your life are

11700 :  im sure i will

11701 :  ive been inspired by many and i hope i can be as strong as them someday

11702 :  but i do want to encourage a more considered approach to the way we use it to respond to injustice

11703 :  i dont know anything about you

11704 :  but its as if because they might be behind a screen in the comfort in their own home when on social media people forget that what theyre

11705 :  with us this was holding my attacker to account and many others

11706 :  now there are few words to describe the all consuming feelings of vulnerability shame upset and injustice that i was

11707 :  divisive twitter trolls were quick to create even more injustice commenting on my attackers ethnicity or

11708 :  but in this way we can begin to use social media as an active tool for social justice as a tool to educate to stimulate

11709 :  but i dont want to discourage a social media response because i owe the development of the notguilty campaign almost

11710 :  but how can a cancer spread in a population

11711 :  and when you have a population of fast dividing cancer cells if one of them acquires new mutations which allow them

11712 :  her body was riddled with secondary tumors

11713 :  natural selection is survival of the fittest

11714 :  her guts were swimming with parasitic worms

11715 :  and that dependency only shows itself when energys gone when the power goes out and you find yourself eating a cold

11716 :  with energy a key problem is that weve grown habituated to having such a fabulous reliable

11717 :  jumping to pre agricultural humans fifty thousand years ago or so we took in energy as

11718 :  well i can tell you exactly what it felt like in the pre zeus era

11719 :  is a totally reasonable question

11720 :  but everyone in this room has a story

11721 :  i bought into this dream more than anyone

11722 :  work your way up

11723 :  and then because we know weve got vegetable tourists and we love them to bits and theyre absolutely fantastic we thought what could we do to give

11724 :  they want positive actions they can engage in and in their bones they know its time to take personal

11725 :  what could we actually do

11726 :  so we did some really simple things

11727 :  can we find that language

11728 :  and they do that for two reasons

11729 :  the soundscape is made up of three basic sources

11730 :  in a matter of seconds a soundscape reveals much more information from many perspectives

11731 :  well i was wrong

11732 :  i told adam we have to tell people

11733 :  and i go through this and i say to myself oh my gosh

11734 :  adam look look

11735 :  thats there comfort

11736 :  do you know how much it costs to cut off the rest of your leg

11737 :  im not an amputee

11738 :  my leg never grew back

11739 :  i wanted to get to that point

11740 :  look at this brochure

11741 :  cheese cheese and more cheese please

11742 :  what do you want on it

11743 :  take the temperature of the room

11744 :  its on rerun tonight

11745 :  we wont be and thats ok

11746 :  and it all comes flooding back to me

11747 :  im bringing pizza

11748 :  those are ways to engage and excite us about your content

11749 :  first question to answer for us so what

11750 :  can we control our emotions

11751 :  the question always remains before us

11752 :  he said come on ill give you five if you can slap me on the cheek

11753 :  and the day after that do one jumping jack

11754 :  life is always going to come down to that whether it takes us a few minutes or a few months or years

11755 :  i trained the top us olympian as well

11756 :  how about our emotions

11757 :  if you want to become obsessed about something ill tell you how

11758 :  so this is my little secret to give you

11759 :  i said dont worry

11760 :  did you hear what i was just saying

11761 :  i would just say hi my name is dan

11762 :  is it innate or developed

11763 :  i have to tell you

11764 :  these fly autonomously

11765 :  this is the key to the technology

11766 :  thats the part thats broken

11767 :  thats the part that works

11768 :  one billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads

11769 :  it was my plan

11770 :  at the age of twentynine
11771 :  two miles every single day

11772 :  now some of you in this room probably know my story

11773 :  its called the streaming trials

11774 :  i dont remember meeting you

11775 :  i think the greatest adversity that weve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy

11776 :  ps part to get me to do the exercises i didnt want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the

11777 :  oh that guy

11778 :  he said well you wouldnt remember meeting me

11779 :  in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical

11780 :  and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students

11781 :  let me read you the entry

11782 :  we have facts to prove that if we invest in women and girls and provide them with better health and well being they will

11783 :  we have to start by bringing simplicity and dignity to womens health issues from reducing maternal mortality

11784 :  there are thousands of simple issues that require low cost interventions

11785 :  they were absolutely right it would cause more infection

11786 :  in fact we need huge spotlights placed in the world of womens health if we need a better tomorrow

11787 :  but we need more light

11788 :  the women were never consulted in this process

11789 :  the women said they would rather deliver on a floor than on a plastic sheet that smeared blood all over

11790 :  the resulting product would be

11791 :  thats one of the reasons we use plastics in food packaging

11792 :  to protect from the oxygen in the air

11793 :  and added bonus its calorie free

11794 :  thinner than a human hair easily

11795 :  nanocellulose is typically around ninetynine water when we make it in the lab

11796 :  thats very nice

11797 :  in two thousand and fifteen alone we made about three hundred and twentytwo million metric

11798 :  you only have to go out your door

11799 :  that happens rather quickly once i get my hands on some

11800 :  did we manage

11801 :  if we stop defining each other by what were not and start defining ourselves by what we are we can be

11802 :  many of my males friends express that they have to be masculine and not show emotion in order to be accepted

11803 :  both men and women suffer from gender stereotypes and gender roles and this is very easy to forget

11804 :  by definition this is not what feminism is

11805 :  we need to think beyond horizons regarding gender and gender equality

11806 :  likewise gender based stereotypes affect men too

11807 :  men face discrimination too

11808 :  after watching this video an hour later rich people became just as generous of

11809 :  this is for them

11810 :  even people at the top experience these outcomes

11811 :  and thats a really really incredible insight into how the mind makes sense of

11812 :  resistance is futile

11813 :  dont overexaggerate potential superpowers that do not exist

11814 :  thats bad intentions

11815 :  you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is

11816 :  without them its going to be a problem

11817 :  its working its way slowly across the us and wiping out populations of bats

11818 :  but bats are very different

11819 :  and hopefully in the next five years ill be giving you a ted talk on that

11820 :  so indeed we need them for our ecosystems to function properly

11821 :  were a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly different than us

11822 :  it sieves out the bad variation

11823 :  and the reality that bats can bring us so much benefits if we just

11824 :  what about health

11825 :  and one hundred and seventy increase of individuals over eighty
11826 :  as ive said before bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly

11827 :  so say for example the region of the genome that i was looking at was a region thats important for vision

11828 :  and so as with flight its very metabolically costly

11829 :  but we are going to have to understand it a bit better

11830 :  thats what i am

11831 :  and its great

11832 :  thats all it is

11833 :  why are we surprised when so many students drop out of high school

11834 :  he was just being what i was

11835 :  i imagine most of the people sitting in this room spent most of their time when they were in middle school

11836 :  it is this fear thats feeding the diet industry which is keeping so many of us from making

11837 :  or no he didnt

11838 :  and this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played

11839 :  or how could he

11840 :  and yared eventually recognized as saint yared used these scales to compose five volumes of

11841 :  musician and natural soundscape expert bernie krause describes how a healthy environment has animals and

11842 :  in ethiopia birds are considered an integral part of the origin of music itself

11843 :  so because of the sharing economy organ donorship increased

11844 :  we re told our value through our clothing size our numerical age

11845 :  for years economic justice has been evolving to seek out new ways to bring together the global world

11846 :  indentured servants were brought here from europe

11847 :  king was asking us to think of the larger structure of the world and how it is being constructed

11848 :  we have access to an unparalleled amount of information at every moment of

11849 :  humanistic feats of intelligence brought to us the internet

11850 :  keep the words of dr

11851 :  a research team that i had the privilege to be a part of sought to detail the evolution in a societal relationship

11852 :  king and let us change our relationship with the economy

11853 :  i believe that everyone should have the ability to create

11854 :  the more people meet the more they discuss the more they create

11855 :  so i decided to change that

11856 :  we went to harvard and we checked almost every department and in fact from harvard business school where a few people

11857 :  we can ask it about other things as well

11858 :  and the expensive pain medication worked better

11859 :  what are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it knowing that you could end randomly

11860 :  how do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality in terms of health

11861 :  of course all foods are processed

11862 :  i can do what ive always wanted to do with food which is simply enjoy it

11863 :  we all really like it

11864 :  at this particular warehouse during their high season every single day they might move in and out

11865 :  you do things and i do things

11866 :  im really interested in that i dedicated the last chapter of my book to the endeavor of eating unprocessed on the amount of

11867 :  it pulls our triggers in ways that makes us want to eat more

11868 :  the second process is what happens to you when you actually eat that food

11869 :  and its survival depends on pesticides refrigeration and semi trucks

11870 :  how your body responds when you drink a glass of apple juice versus eating an apple

11871 :  it is in for example in the blueberry flavored flax seeds

11872 :  but the problem with sugar is that im not alone

11873 :  i dont have to worry about where my money is going because i know whos getting my money

11874 :  apple juice on the other hand is immediate

11875 :  yes we call him farmer frank

11876 :  and what makes a food processed

11877 :  its only when you and i decide to make small changes in our own lives that big change begins to

11878 :  before i go there i will say i love sugar

11879 :  i have dieted on and off my whole life

11880 :  it is overwhelming all of the choices were faced with today

11881 :  people cant really make high fructose corn syrup without access to a laboratory and an advanced chemistry degree

11882 :  people can make corn into corn tortillas

11883 :  i dont have to worry about where my food is coming from because i know where is coming from

11884 :  make it your one sweet a day

11885 :  lets go back to tonight

11886 :  but the fact of the matter is most of us have a few dollars that we could spend differently

11887 :  and the answer to that question is sugar

11888 :  the spinach of breakfast confections

11889 :  and thats what makes sugar so tricky

11890 :  do you feel differently

11891 :  its one rule and then i dont have to think about it

11892 :  i am aware that there are people for whom four 50c a meal is simply unaffordable

11893 :  and that immediacy stresses your body out

11894 :  a migrating field crew goes in there and harvests them within a day they pack them up put them on a semi truck

11895 :  it comes in so many different forms its really had to avoid

11896 :  agriculture is a kind of process so is cooking fermenting dicing preserving

11897 :  and it is this last one that of consumer spending that i find the most potential for un processing

11898 :  i remember standing in this warehouse full of mangoes and it being inconceivable to me how this mass of fruit might ever

11899 :  sugar is in everything

11900 :  it starts on a farm a really big farm one thousand acres of watermelon

11901 :  you stop at the store on the way home to see if they have kale

11902 :  so when you buy food thats gone through this vast system you are supporting that ninetyone cents

11903 :  how does a watermelon get from the ground in hermosillo to a safeway in tucson

11904 :  and let me tell you the scale is staggering

11905 :  all foods are processed and often they are better for it

11906 :  ive counted calories ive done weight watchers really ive been through the wringer

11907 :  but i read what we have read

11908 :  lets go to the second process

11909 :  but whats important to know is that for your body sugar is sugar

11910 :  the system is vast

11911 :  this is what i eat

11912 :  id like to give you one example

11913 :  and every time we do this there is a chance that the baby might miscarry

11914 :  and then i spent the next two hours thinking about that idea

11915 :  so by using this plasma dna tissue mapping it will basically allow us to monitor cell death from different parts

11916 :  and one example of a genetic disease which is sex linked is hemophilia which is a genetic disorder

11917 :  and to diagnose these diseases a doctor would frequently have to gain access to the cells with

11918 :  i have actually lost one of my best friends from school to this disease

11919 :  now if regarded the release of dna from a baby into his mothers blood

11920 :  its in a way like a type of mri scan which will also give you genomic information

11921 :  we call this plasma dna tissue mapping

11922 :  and i saw no signal if a mother is carrying a baby girl

11923 :  now recently a pregnant woman sent her blood sample to our laboratory for pre natal testing

11924 :  i even managed to persuade a professor in oxford to let me work in his laboratory for a few months

11925 :  she wanted to know whether her baby is healthy or not

11926 :  a hundred and forty seven

11927 :  but now do you know how many nations have a president

11928 :  and this was debated in congress for ages and ages

11929 :  and that title

11930 :  what do you call the leader of a republican country

11931 :  thats not acceptable

11932 :  our brain cant wait another year

11933 :  well guess what

11934 :  and i started thinking about it again

11935 :  if the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom it has no impact on the productivity of

11936 :  did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the

11937 :  she watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my

11938 :  companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices tend to

11939 :  he never finishes college

11940 :  they embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who theyve become and know

11941 :  a resume tells a story

11942 :  its like medicine

11943 :  well it turns out they do like snow

11944 :  so this what else is going

11945 :  are there small scale experiments or systems we can nudge and play with

11946 :  theres the european jackal

11947 :  theres bears coming back

11948 :  theres just a few animals there

11949 :  thats halfway through its gestation period

11950 :  science is organized skepticism

11951 :  and the optimist in me is trying hard to lean towards this is awesome and really exciting

11952 :  theres lynx coming back

11953 :  and youve probably finished the book

11954 :  how on earth do we think about it

11955 :  ca well come back to the mammoths but explain how we should think of extinctions

11956 :  we dont understand how the climate system works

11957 :  you wrote we are as gods and might as well get used to it

11958 :  voila the oxygen that we all need to survive

11959 :  so thank you nasa

11960 :  they grow well in many many countries

11961 :  you want to put the song in your movie thats different and the ip rights are all specified

11962 :  and thats of greater interest

11963 :  so today there are companies working to create an identity in a black

11964 :  its not a fiat currency controlled by a nation state

11965 :  our privacy is being undermined

11966 :  you want to listen to the song

11967 :  and then this avatar is sweeping up all of this data and enabling you to

11968 :  musicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain

11969 :  what if there were a native medium for value

11970 :  you want to make a ringtone

11971 :  and its not social media

11972 :  there are all kinds of people who dont get fair compensation and with blockchains theyre going to be able to make

11973 :  some people who have xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular

11974 :  theyre in the back of our body

11975 :  and if you look for example in the declaration of independence they talk about nature and natures god

11976 :  and the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone

11977 :  and its not just in terms of sex

11978 :  as we look we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas

11979 :  feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender so theres nothing feminine about feminism

11980 :  now i dont want you to spend too much time imagining the conception because if you do youre not going to listen to me

11981 :  and a lot of what ive worked on is people who have atypical sex so people who dont have the standard male

11982 :  i dont want to say a five year old should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry

11983 :  and he was born looking like a boy nobody suspected anything

11984 :  i mean they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that

11985 :  and as a consequence his genitals were masculinized his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones

11986 :  both are viable both take off

11987 :  i had a lot of journalists calling me asking me which is the test theyre going to run that will tell us whether or not

11988 :  i also want to say there are probably also some yellow labradors that i know that are more capable of informed intelligent

11989 :  intersex comes in a lot of different forms

11990 :  where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings

11991 :  and were not exactly sure why that happens

11992 :  some of what ive worked on is people who have dwarfism so people who are much shorter than typical

11993 :  they dont talk about god and gods nature

11994 :  it turns out to be really difficult

11995 :  one of the places were seeing it for example in our culture in the united states today is battles over the beginning of life

11996 :  lets imagine one of them mary is born three months prematurely so shes born on june one
11997 :  in the past our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead

11998 :  and in the other case the sperm is carrying an x chromosome meeting the x chromosome of the egg

11999 :  what happened was women for example who wanted the right to vote took the founding fathers concept of

12000 :  i dont want to say we give up entirely on anatomy

12001 :  you find management against employees groups of employees against other groups of employees sales against

12002 :  now they sit and wait for the phone to ring

12003 :  yet we you look into organizations in the companies what do you find

12004 :  when will this person start to function

12005 :  how do you make a family out of all these different peoples

12006 :  when you say

12007 :  theyve got studies in team dynamics and more leadership with more tools with which we can build a strong and

12008 :  i believe the youth of today should be exposed to opportunities like this

12009 :  and then that got me thinking

12010 :  after she watched it she called her daughter up and said hey dont you want to come over and we can talk about this

12011 :  and why did so many want to share their personal experiences with me

12012 :  well you know you faked it its all false its not real

12013 :  one hot october morning i got off the all night train in

12014 :  so we dont want to do that

12015 :  what do i mean by these kinds of therapeutics

12016 :  the last person standing were going to see what they know

12017 :  ive done it even with progressive members of congress

12018 :  so im talking here about outer truth about objective things

12019 :  and i think we have a tendency to not be clear about this to try to move our inner truths to outer

12020 :  how did you think of it

12021 :  then i found a collection of dorothy parker short stories

12022 :  i live by that

12023 :  we go down dark alleys they go deeper into the shadows further than i have ever been but

12024 :  she taught us to dance to our own shadows

12025 :  it slows the heart beat down

12026 :  my mama never whispered the shame of poverty in our ears

12027 :  so he went to the website of longfellow books

12028 :  and prescription drug prices are among the lowest in the country

12029 :  its not the product of some kind of natural evolution

12030 :  i want to thank you for your order

12031 :  i just had a question about it

12032 :  millions of jobs in manufacturing and small businesses are gone and all weve gotten in exchange are very low

12033 :  they get to know the borrower face to face

12034 :  were planning to keep it on our books for thirty years

12035 :  its the logical outcome of a set of policies

12036 :  it doesnt have my name on it

12037 :  its going to south carolina

12038 :  so much so that when it stumbled and found itself teetering on the verge of bankruptcy parliament

12039 :  my local bookstore in portland

12040 :  is this book for stacy mitchell

12041 :  but what i want to suggest to you today is that a purely consumer based response to this problem on

12042 :  this is one of those moments

12043 :  just image if we took a small amount of the savings and redirected it to new initiatives to grow

12044 :  its coming from arizona

12045 :  so instead of having executives issue grand proclamations the team in effect manages itself

12046 :  and the truth is recent research backs him up

12047 :  each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way

12048 :  eleanor takes care of their four children ages ten to fifteen
12049 :  so i turned to david so why does it work

12050 :  every minute above that we have to do one pushup

12051 :  it turns out theres only ten minutes of productive time in any family meal

12052 :  whats great about the agile system is you build in a system of change so that you can react to whats happening to you in real time

12053 :  one has lacrosse on the near side of town

12054 :  as sutherland told me we got to that article and said thats it

12055 :  with kids its heaven

12056 :  they do things in small chunks

12057 :  we are travelers not tourists

12058 :  if we get fifteen minutes of overreaction time thats the limit

12059 :  so how can we change this dynamic

12060 :  again research shows that parents should spend less time worrying about what they do wrong and more

12061 :  ive mentioned just three here today adapt all the time empower the children tell your

12062 :  well have family breakfast

12063 :  theres plenty of parental authority going on

12064 :  and heres the worst news of all

12065 :  so move where you sit

12066 :  what worked well this week

12067 :  my wife bought a flip chart

12068 :  the point is there are all these new ideas out there

12069 :  we were living in complete chaos eleanor said

12070 :  jim collins the author of good to great told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common

12071 :  it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldnt light up their world for many years to come

12072 :  you can take that ten minutes and move it to any part of the day and have the same benefit

12073 :  and we ended up with ten statements

12074 :  as the author of the study told me children who have a sense of theyre part of a larger narrative

12075 :  one has asperger syndrome

12076 :  they were too bloated or too out of date by the time they were done

12077 :  we had a pajama party

12078 :  and these meetings had this effect while taking under twenty minutes

12079 :  the conversation will go better

12080 :  im not home cant make family dinner

12081 :  im proposing three planks

12082 :  plank number one adapt all the time

12083 :  adaptability is fine but we also need bedrock

12084 :  its like they say in the internet world if youre doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago youre doing the wrong thing

12085 :  and we had this great conversation like whats important to us

12086 :  what didnt work well

12087 :  we dont like dilemmas

12088 :  and i said but what if they drive into a ditch

12089 :  this family mission statement is a great way to identify what it is that you do right

12090 :  she said do i get one five minute overreaction or can i get ten thirty second

12091 :  do you know where your parents went to high school

12092 :  well meet for a bedtime snack

12093 :  when i became a parent i figured you know what

12094 :  so agile is great for stimulating progress but i kept hearing time and again you need to preserve the core

12095 :  our children sense were out of control

12096 :  i told david keep your work out of my kitchen

12097 :  just as i was leaving to come here tonight one of my daughters started screaming

12098 :  but were giving them practice becoming independent which of course is our ultimate goal

12099 :  now give us a punishment

12100 :  spend the time however you want

12101 :  a few weeks later we got a call from the school

12102 :  you have constant feedback

12103 :  lets talk about it

12104 :  just when they stop needing our help taking a bath they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying

12105 :  i was talking to warren buffetts banker and he was chiding me for not letting my children make mistakes with their allowance

12106 :  so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement

12107 :  he said you cant underestimate the power of doing this

12108 :  children who plan their own goals set weekly schedules evaluate their own work

12109 :  what values do we most uphold

12110 :  thats what i thought she said

12111 :  you had blogs pop up and some manuals were written

12112 :  weve got to hook them up with parents

12113 :  just when our kids stop teething they start having tantrums

12114 :  even the sutherlands told me that they had an agile thanksgiving where you had one group of people working on the food

12115 :  but i was wrong

12116 :  you have daily update sessions

12117 :  actually i burned one so i made two

12118 :  spend time retelling the story of your familys positive moments and how you overcame the

12119 :  so how do you do that

12120 :  my wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom

12121 :  everybody knows that having family dinner with your children is good for the kids

12122 :  one of our daughters had gotten into a spat

12123 :  he said in the workplace adults love it

12124 :  everyone throws out suggestions and then we pick two to focus on

12125 :  then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways

12126 :  and if youre happy with that fantastic

12127 :  if youre not too bad

12128 :  we build with mindshare

12129 :  why have games you can lose

12130 :  theyre not very well designed

12131 :  they should recognize theyve built an appointment dynamic and leverage the games

12132 :  thats really really powerful

12133 :  we use game dynamics to build on it

12134 :  progression is powerful

12135 :  hopefully for good

12136 :  and thats very powerful to me

12137 :  why go from an a to an f or a b to a c

12138 :  status is really good motivator

12139 :  why not level up

12140 :  and thats a very powerful thing

12141 :  theres other people who have kids ones addicted to alcohol the other ones addicted to cocaine or heroin and they ask themselves the

12142 :  and what we really need to do is to bring the underground drug markets as much as

12143 :  because maybe where we start to have a little bit of a problem is where there is too much noise

12144 :  and whats the big deal in a way

12145 :  i know youve all taken that which disney princess am i

12146 :  what if you are thinking

12147 :  and it doesnt actually matter how you start on social or why you started

12148 :  maybe they never will

12149 :  and the great thing about emojis is we can feel a broader range of things

12150 :  unruly are a viral video agency and theyve studied this too and actually the

12151 :  the second reason is because you are doing it anyway

12152 :  so i just pulled my coat around my waist and babbled my way through the other classes in the rest

12153 :  so i stumbled in and i thought what the hell ill give this a go

12154 :  my tight trousers story

12155 :  i know i am going to have to exaggerate wildly amplify everything through emoji just to get my point

12156 :  so in my day job i run the future foundation

12157 :  because id been flashing my pants at the class for the last half an hour

12158 :  if we can tell and share socially how we feel in the future we will know more about

12159 :  and anyone can instigate this a person a charity a brand that wants to drive us towards greater

12160 :  so on that afternoon i was thinking you know whatever

12161 :  and then you fast forward to one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven and the notorious b

12162 :  snoop doggy dogg covers this song on his debut album doggystyle and calls it lodi dodi

12163 :  thats the major thread

12164 :  these records dont really age that well

12165 :  its been sampled five hundred and fortyseven times

12166 :  he lives all the way in l

12167 :  conroy was indignant

12168 :  but one year they lost the contract

12169 :  and then i remembered jonestown

12170 :  but now the maker community and the open source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how

12171 :  so the more people experiment with materials the more researchers are willing to share

12172 :  the objects we use the clothes we wear the houses we live in all have a profound

12173 :  so many times amateurs not experts have been the inventors and improvers

12174 :  program at cambridge university

12175 :  because i lost my cell phone

12176 :  its gone forever

12177 :  im here for the absolute worst reason

12178 :  we became very protective of each other

12179 :  it ended like a movie

12180 :  next day get a new phone forget about the old one

12181 :  i was having happy hour a twenty dollar bottle of wine just having fun chatting with my co workers i

12182 :  this crazy thing is happening

12183 :  i kind of tell my friends about it you guys gotta check out my phone

12184 :  we take a selfie and we got off the plane and i walk to the baggage claim

12185 :  5million people in southern china and its pretty uneventful until i get on my last leg

12186 :  freak out you turn the bar upside down everyone get up right now i need to find my phone

12187 :  i mean we all know what its like to lose your phone

12188 :  why am i here right now

12189 :  were always like wheres my phone wheres my phone

12190 :  a friend of mine whom i shared an office with at the lab happened to see this

12191 :  and there are many more methods that we can use

12192 :  and a digital trail like the one daniel was talking about is no different

12193 :  do i or dont i

12194 :  thats kind of when a light went off in my head

12195 :  i think we need to create backups of humankind elsewhere in the solar system

12196 :  because our infrastructure for building space systems is entirely earth bound

12197 :  and so the question i ask all of you today is why wait

12198 :  but it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions

12199 :  and if we can hold two things we can hold four and if we can hold four we can hold eight and if we can hold eight we can hold hundreds

12200 :  at the same time theres nothing more important to me than the kids in my life so i found myself in a situation that we

12201 :  stance on gayness over her heritage

12202 :  am i an aunt

12203 :  and it was the same way on the course

12204 :  and when i was the first woman to complete the american ninja warrior course i was on top of the world

12205 :  i am going to figure a way to get what i want

12206 :  and i just try and think about it in simpler terms

12207 :  i did it i wedged my feet in there

12208 :  with your hands on one side feet on one side

12209 :  of course not

12210 :  but either way i have learnt to make it happen

12211 :  the engineers have a problem

12212 :  we wrote a compaction routine that reduces the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude

12213 :  you can have as many fonts on your system as you like

12214 :  we solved that problem last week

12215 :  but what i really want to say is

12216 :  are you married to a japanese

12217 :  i often reply with

12218 :  nice by itself is parsley

12219 :  if he saw bane destroy gotham and changed the subject to the weather

12220 :  a world that demands we be more than nice sometimes

12221 :  its an air that operates quite a lot like a liquid

12222 :  this has intriguing implications

12223 :  five years to get there

12224 :  for some context we passed the orbit of the moon in less than nine hours

12225 :  its just getting worse

12226 :  everyones been in it or is going to be in it

12227 :  its as if theyre all in one big tribe

12228 :  these people are in danger

12229 :  i kept having panic attacks but they eventually went away

12230 :  we were trying to understand the threat against us

12231 :  the suicide rate went down

12232 :  but i didnt really think it affected me

12233 :  race relations are terrible

12234 :  the lights were too bright

12235 :  praise your mouth

12236 :  praise your resurrection

12237 :  praise the becoming

12238 :  and what faith felt like

12239 :  that problem is called jamming and thats a problem that plagues bats or should plague bats and also any

12240 :  how do you solve that problem

12241 :  how do i control their interactions

12242 :  but i dont do it from an entirely engineering or mathematical perspective

12243 :  but the question becomes

12244 :  if confirmed this would have a huge impact on our definition of life on how we look for life

12245 :  we work together both on a modest proposal dance to phd today

12246 :  so what im doing right now is im making sounds with my mouth as im exhaling

12247 :  there are humans around the world who stay oriented really well

12248 :  but that would actually get you oriented pretty fast right

12249 :  well partially because it was really difficult or thought to be difficult to weaponize the virus but

12250 :  and this is really the point

12251 :  why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now

12252 :  in fact its much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or

12253 :  and vaccines are our best defense

12254 :  and in fact weve actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade

12255 :  well honestly i didnt know the answer to that question

12256 :  i wanted our life back

12257 :  but we dug in and fought back

12258 :  i didnt want money back i wanted bion back

12259 :  but people like me the professional troublemakers should not be the only ones who are committed to being these dominoes who are always falling out of

12260 :  i went ziplining through the forests of punta cana

12261 :  we should always have justice

12262 :  and that same semester i started blogging

12263 :  now we are also teaching them combat skills of course but i would argue open source

12264 :  when we do it we must do it well and competently

12265 :  sophisticated communications sweep

12266 :  two trillion a year

12267 :  multiply this by four hundred thousand patient treatments this private public collaboration

12268 :  so this cyber sea which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical

12269 :  why do we want to be involved

12270 :  we see it in the caribbean

12271 :  wikipedia every day is tens of thousands of people inputting information

12272 :  like human intuition

12273 :  and i created a piece that explores computer based intuition in a physical space

12274 :  and the piece will start being one way that we test for the humanness of a conversation and the parts that get lost in

12275 :  ive been collaborating with a conversation analyst at the lab to try to help our ai systems hold more human

12276 :  so when you walk in front of it it starts to use all of the data that its captured throughout its exhibition history

12277 :  and we call this the uncanny valley

12278 :  so in the lab ive been creating art as a way to help me design better experiences for bleeding edge

12279 :  its a beautiful thing to see

12280 :  the founder or the manager has to answer it

12281 :  i flew here actually from necker island

12282 :  now thats something i fall short of on a daily basis

12283 :  just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your ears and to

12284 :  and if we can teach listening in our schools we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous

12285 :  they adapt very simple rules and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist

12286 :  so this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response

12287 :  so i set out to study electrical engineering and robotics and my end of studies project

12288 :  if she dies on the road the whole group is at risk

12289 :  and one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us and

12290 :  and we get a sense of just how big of a deal pornography really its

12291 :  it serves to provide peer support for those trying to reboot their sexuality by going long periods of time often months

12292 :  well building and maintaining a long term relationship or a marriage can already be challenging

12293 :  thus its novelty not simply sex in general that from a biological perspective dominated male arousal

12294 :  now i grew up christian and i certainly identify as christian today

12295 :  this quickly spirals downwards as viewers pursue ever more extreme porn to get the same high

12296 :  ive been to the metropolitan museum now more than three hundred times in the last three years

12297 :  we hire people from a diverse set of backgrounds

12298 :  so they get dragged there on a date or something

12299 :  i never would have been here

12300 :  my name is nick gray

12301 :  my friends told their friends and their friends told their friends

12302 :  i would ask my friends i would say think about this

12303 :  by the way he was painting christ like this to signify the man child that he was about to

12304 :  when they come we welcome them to the museum

12305 :  this is a very hard stone

12306 :  there are two things you need to know about yellow jasper

12307 :  so those were my museum tours

12308 :  we dont exactly know who it is

12309 :  the name of my company is museum hack

12310 :  our guides write all of their own routes

12311 :  there is a lot of mystery

12312 :  with r amp amp d centers in india of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the indian centers

12313 :  so my coauthor phanish puranam who happens to be one of the smartest people i know said hes going to do a study

12314 :  they were working on truly global products and companies like microsoft google astrazeneca

12315 :  it turned out in every single case they came out of the indian educational system

12316 :  and a similar patent filed out of the same companys subsidiary in india so hes now comparing the patents

12317 :  what he did was he looked at those companies that had an r amp amp d center in usa and in india

12318 :  its about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product but not a new product

12319 :  and one hundred and fifty thousand are in india

12320 :  when you ask where are the indian googles ipods and viagras

12321 :  r amp amp d subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an indian

12322 :  will india go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a

12323 :  indian institutes and educational system with a few exceptions are incapable of producing

12324 :  i also wanted somebody who would weigh twenty pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed

12325 :  see the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and i dont when confronted with

12326 :  very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves

12327 :  so i created ten fake male profiles

12328 :  so i didnt reach out to any woman first

12329 :  so were nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and ive decided steve the i

12330 :  youve got to date around

12331 :  i also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that i do

12332 :  for me the hobbies that i have are really just new work projects that ive launched

12333 :  im looking for a husband

12334 :  so i go back online now

12335 :  guy invited me out to one of philadelphias white table cloth extremely expensive restaurants

12336 :  in fact its something that you write yourself

12337 :  im not looking for a pen pal

12338 :  i wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online

12339 :  so steve the i

12340 :  its just not the ones that were being presented with online

12341 :  what was every single possible thing that i could think of that i was looking for in a mate

12342 :  well as it turns out there is an algorithm for love

12343 :  well as it turns out this worked pretty well

12344 :  they couldn t stop and somehow came to terms with his passing much more quickly

12345 :  i never wanted to talk about my thirty years with an eating disorder because i was embarrassed

12346 :  the fear that we re not good enough and the fear that we won t have enough

12347 :  looking for the funny in the fatal was certainly my salvation

12348 :  you know i chanted affirmations like a mad woman

12349 :  physically she recoiled

12350 :  because when it comes to anxiety most of us across the globe share the same two fears

12351 :  how s your hyphen

12352 :  my obsession with helping began for purely selfish reasons

12353 :  self esteem is good

12354 :  but to someone with high anxiety every day challenges can seem like a life and death situation

12355 :  i think about that woman every year on my birthday

12356 :  but maybe start with yourself

12357 :  and she said

12358 :  no one is promised tomorrow

12359 :  i set up the type i printed it out on an epson printer with water soluble ink taped it to

12360 :  what does that mean

12361 :  and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic

12362 :  and no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue

12363 :  and i thought yeah he does have a really good point here

12364 :  because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard

12365 :  they use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton

12366 :  because he was afraid i was walking into a trap

12367 :  im not sure this projects going to pan out

12368 :  if the wall around the erectile tissue wasnt there if it wasnt reinforced in this

12369 :  so i went ahead collected wall tissue prepared it so it was erect sectioned it

12370 :  and my first forays into biological research doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate

12371 :  theyre an integral part of the penile skeleton

12372 :  it became a national and international story

12373 :  david do what you care about

12374 :  you are in a tedx audience i know you are passionate about other things

12375 :  share it with other people

12376 :  it was fearless

12377 :  where did the birds go

12378 :  the story evolved more people had their caps stolen the city put up some signs it

12379 :  it just seems impossible

12380 :  the cornell lab of ornithology has a leading citizen science program where anything you want to know about birds

12381 :  we knew a lot about her life and the day she died

12382 :  and scientists were ready for this piece of evidence

12383 :  they can answer important questions that we have about the world

12384 :  he figured out where it was

12385 :  be a good citizen

12386 :  i knew it was either a barred owl or a grey horned owl just protecting its breeding territory

12387 :  i want you to walk away thinking that birds are awesome their stories matter and that you can

12388 :  it breeds in an arctic summer with a day of almost twentyfour hours long

12389 :  as my friend ryan jacks who was attacked by owl capone one morning jogging in the park shared with the paper he

12390 :  we had a good sense of humor about it

12391 :  that is flying to the moon back and forth three times

12392 :  if you see a bird take your time look at it take a picture share it

12393 :  she bred she had a family and then staggered the world

12394 :  for three years stephen jr flew around nobody actually saw him

12395 :  ten days after i had marked it in oregon someone in california took its picture

12396 :  we didnt know about that

12397 :  then it flies south for another summer

12398 :  as a surgeon he thought i am having a stroke or i have been hit by lightning

12399 :  this is a young bird

12400 :  they sort of fly off and go away

12401 :  a german person who wasnt a scientist shot this bird

12402 :  now those parts are also physical parts of course brains bodies and legs and things but they arent so important actually

12403 :  we have sensations and experiences as well

12404 :  well maybe not

12405 :  now you might think this is a worrying idea

12406 :  does that mean that really the self is an illusion

12407 :  we have knowledge

12408 :  a lot of companies use these for recruitment

12409 :  but theres also a narrative a story we tell about ourselves the experiences we have when we remember past

12410 :  what is there then

12411 :  we say the watch has a face and hands and a mechanism and a battery

12412 :  and i have to say now ill say it a bit later but im not challenging this just because im weird the challenge actually

12413 :  there are limits to what we can make of ourselves

12414 :  if you have a heart transplant youre still the same person

12415 :  the fact that we are in some ways just this very very complex collection ordered

12416 :  i dont know if youve done those

12417 :  if you watch the x factor too much you might buy into this idea that we can all be whatever we want to be

12418 :  youre born with an essence thats what you are until you die if you

12419 :  now weve got to be careful here right

12420 :  in the same way were not illusions either

12421 :  in a way its common sense

12422 :  i had missed the point

12423 :  theyre like we know

12424 :  and we explained this to participants after the study was over

12425 :  we like it a lot because its an objective measure you can count the number of pins between zero and

12426 :  so id like to tell you about our experimental study on hangry

12427 :  now the noise is a combination of noises that many people really hate like fingernails

12428 :  and they do this task twentyfive times so we can get a more reliable measure of aggression

12429 :  they had higher standardized test scores they were more likely to graduate from college they had happier marriages

12430 :  there are two words

12431 :  its a performance right

12432 :  but it was also because it was so dangerous it was so risky it was so

12433 :  its something thats very underground

12434 :  in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour which was the year that i was thirteen years old and figured out i was gay

12435 :  the operator picks up and i have to utter the words

12436 :  usually i just chauffeur for my sister from house to house

12437 :  now most stories start off with

12438 :  and thats what the amygdala triggers

12439 :  it isnt always come across exactly in your dreams

12440 :  he is the one that everyone looks to to see what they should be doing and if they like it or not

12441 :  now my sister likes to throw parties like any other teenager does

12442 :  my first thought is to get the girls away

12443 :  and i notice that maddies sitting on the porch which is out of place

12444 :  now if theres a tiger in front of you youre really not going to benefit that much from thinking

12445 :  i was milking it

12446 :  and im all alone

12447 :  what emdr does is it really forces you to believe what youre saying and thinking

12448 :  she asks can we go pick up maddie from jasons house

12449 :  and just remember that sometimes it needs a little help

12450 :  im really into knowing where people are coming from in their thoughts actions and words

12451 :  and i subject myself to the same analysis

12452 :  i decide to not go to my favorite museum with my family

12453 :  a recent global survey found that seventythree percent of the top media management jobs are still held by men

12454 :  but this is also about something far more complex

12455 :  putting them there made them more recognizable

12456 :  the global media monitoring project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge

12457 :  and she worked with an editor at national public radio to try to get a story aired nationally

12458 :  case in point

12459 :  you can just see the delight on their faces cant you

12460 :  have you ever done that

12461 :  i thought what could i do with them

12462 :  if we did challenge those beliefs and think differently about them apart from drawing what else would be

12463 :  so i said i would and i booked the time in

12464 :  one is have an open mind

12465 :  ill do my cartoon drawing

12466 :  youre very welcome to take the pens with you and have a practice at home even show somebody else

12467 :  at the end of it i had a lovely email from doctor mike jordan and hes the chair of the talk group

12468 :  are you up for that

12469 :  they just got on with it

12470 :  all were doing is little variations

12471 :  it was an inspirational session for me

12472 :  last january my student who attempted suicide returned from winter break with a gift for me

12473 :  this was the second time in three years that i had a student who is suicidal and there were no

12474 :  thats what happens when we label failing students as failures

12475 :  i was at a parent teacher conference and a parent approached my table

12476 :  well you know what

12477 :  language just doesnt work that way

12478 :  are you bothered by language fads and language change or do you find it fun

12479 :  again a show of hands how many of you have ever looked to see who edited the dictionary

12480 :  i hope that what you can do is find language change not worrisome

12481 :  but who looks at the front matter of dictionaries

12482 :  now a second question

12483 :  we didnt have lots of doctors

12484 :  very good uncle

12485 :  and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog

12486 :  uncle buys a condom

12487 :  the women said we agree

12488 :  we didnt have a strong government

12489 :  i said dont worry

12490 :  so we have now found the weapon of mass protection

12491 :  and this picture was sent throughout the country

12492 :  but its everybodys job who can change attitude and behavior

12493 :  every ministry even judges had to be involved in aids education everyone and we said the public

12494 :  and theyd enjoy it immensely i see them standing around right now everywhere

12495 :  ask yourself one question

12496 :  what are we doing

12497 :  well all these talks on ted

12498 :  i saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes into the lives of the real people we were

12499 :  and there are many websites marketing such dubious products

12500 :  our telomeres are losing the war of attrition faster

12501 :  in the few cases where this has been implemented in africa there has been remarkable successes recorded

12502 :  you own the knowledge

12503 :  you know it all

12504 :  and they just keep going through all these things

12505 :  you dont have enough experts

12506 :  show us let us sign

12507 :  we can do it

12508 :  we know our aim

12509 :  two million cases

12510 :  and so it bothered me

12511 :  i am convinced that africas further transformation africas advancement rests

12512 :  com are filled with these kinds of inqueries

12513 :  this is something i learn from manny

12514 :  and this time he fully knew why

12515 :  eventually narcissus stumbled and saw himself in a pool of water

12516 :  and the idea was write your special talent

12517 :  high five daddy

12518 :  and then i thought about it and i thought oh my god

12519 :  and my wife said i dont have a special talent

12520 :  she is a genius

12521 :  the second form of narcissism which most of you probably dont think of unless you are in the clinical psychology

12522 :  and this is relatively rare we are talking about one or two percent of the population at any one time

12523 :  you want to hear about how awesome i am

12524 :  he immediately fell in love with his reflection and froze

12525 :  so we talk about these sometimes as covert narcissists because they are hard to spot you dont really see them out there

12526 :  and in this place a flower grew a daylily which today we call the narcissus

12527 :  it sort of works

12528 :  so in the old days if you wanted to do the kylie jenner reality show you

12529 :  it was first used by somebody named havelock ellis who was a british sexologist who talked about self love in a

12530 :  i said yeah i dont know

12531 :  but others have used this to really positive ends

12532 :  he died there

12533 :  she just got on her phone filmed herself sent it right to her fans which is just amazing its an amazing

12534 :  the term narcissism or self love came to psychology in a couple ways

12535 :  people who are narcissistic have more friends or followers or links in social media

12536 :  i dont have a special talent

12537 :  and in fact i mean the best way i think about ego is its a tool in your tool box

12538 :  it is not a different thing than the work of school it is the work of school as much as teaching math reading and science

12539 :  it doesnt really matter what its called

12540 :  they get to lead

12541 :  now the question is

12542 :  and i love d

12543 :  they are interdependent co dependent with the academic performance

12544 :  has anyone ever noticed that in their own lives

12545 :  we at chan zuckerberg can do some things

12546 :  imagine what they could do

12547 :  it can happen outside school just as well

12548 :  is my story

12549 :  it changed the possibilities really important

12550 :  were doing a tedx

12551 :  she saw something in me that i wasnt able to see in myself

12552 :  i was sitting in class with dr

12553 :  dun saw me through my entire college application process

12554 :  i have my health

12555 :  and i thank him for that

12556 :  charles derry whos a very revered person in our film world

12557 :  dun she gave me five dollars in gas money to get home from high school one day

12558 :  were really excited about it

12559 :  i grew up poor but i fit in

12560 :  i hope i get to continue to make films

12561 :  but then what came in

12562 :  remember the second strategy financialization

12563 :  so that was a problem

12564 :  you had to do that in order to be able to push down salaries as much as they did

12565 :  so all of a sudden banks could lend as much as they wanted they could have as high

12566 :  so the money is just a tool

12567 :  and he dreamt of being able to travel the fortyeight
12568 :  can you maybe think back to when that was

12569 :  i wish i could fly there

12570 :  i wish i could fly

12571 :  and he said

12572 :  mostly people were fighting for hope determined never to give up people like jane in wexford who

12573 :  but im sure he could see that i was a wreck

12574 :  i felt like i was becoming a fraud

12575 :  i remembered who i was and what it was about

12576 :  parts of me came together again

12577 :  the world health organisation says that depression is fast becoming one of the biggest public

12578 :  i thought ill go around the country and ask people what their views are

12579 :  people opened up to me

12580 :  higgins called to appoint me to the council of state

12581 :  i became free

12582 :  people started to give me money donating online and handing it to me as i went which was really important because i

12583 :  id sold my car because i needed the money

12584 :  everywhere i went i posted social media updates

12585 :  how can i speak about citizens views of the future

12586 :  now people will say im a dreamer

12587 :  and you dont need to go hitchhiking

12588 :  your voice matters

12589 :  people started following it

12590 :  i was very dyslexic as a child which is why i had to have help with the letter to such an extent

12591 :  zebras tigers and so on this chemical phenomena

12592 :  so by comparison between the different examples which one can see are all related we all

12593 :  we actually use wave technology on our open pond systems we have ninetyfive mixing and

12594 :  now this is a country he has little knowledge of

12595 :  we roll our eyes at some of the embarrassing stories that get shared over and over and

12596 :  ive shared this interesting story with many family members at many family gatherings

12597 :  and if i hadnt created that protected space for my parents to share their stories i dont think i would have ever

12598 :  these are stories at the heart of our identities

12599 :  my father is a young and ambitious man

12600 :  that cars are meant to be dented and this would be the first of many dents he would experience in his

12601 :  of course the internet has evolved and progressed quite a lot since then and it has made it

12602 :  this was my identity to the world and this was my story the way that i wanted to tell it

12603 :  families need protected spaces too

12604 :  they could be as simple as some time set aside in the day for yourself or they could be family

12605 :  they told me stories about the white vw bug but also stories about the korean war they

12606 :  we consume each others photos links and likes

12607 :  so my father went there and he bought a white volkswagen beetle

12608 :  they could be both physical and virtual

12609 :  we figured that out so quick

12610 :  i dont date the peter pan guys

12611 :  i want this kind of person who does this and who is interested in this

12612 :  oh ok so you do date them

12613 :  oh but they have so much potential and we have so much in common

12614 :  we have to be happy with ourselves we have to be happy with our presence and happiness will come to

12615 :  no just run

12616 :  so the issue is your focus the issue is your perspective

12617 :  i want to fix this problem

12618 :  oh whatever makes you happy

12619 :  and we may even admit to ourselves

12620 :  be brave enough to walk away

12621 :  we separate from them

12622 :  and so what do we do

12623 :  well theyre just jealous or they never had a good relationship

12624 :  how do i do this

12625 :  do we think we have to settle for this person

12626 :  yeah i probably should end it

12627 :  they tell her theyre affectionate they write poems they sing songs all this wonderful stuff

12628 :  im really serious

12629 :  we have to be bolder

12630 :  talk to a professional a consultant a therapist anyone just talk to someone else to

12631 :  do we think we are not worth it

12632 :  who does she fall in love with

12633 :  we got married

12634 :  when you want to punch somebody and then you realize

12635 :  well let me just put it out there

12636 :  but we dont

12637 :  dont lie to yourself and tell yourself

12638 :  is that really important

12639 :  oh my gosh they going to think i am crazy maybe thats a problem

12640 :  that cancer then goes throughout the rest of the body eventually causing organ failure and death among a whole bunch of other

12641 :  then we are able to calculate for something called synergy

12642 :  each cancer cell is incredibly different from every other one

12643 :  in fact some of the earliest discovered human tissues in archaeological sites are riddled with tumors and some of the

12644 :  two of the most important hallmarks of cancer are genomic instability of the cancers which means that they have

12645 :  since theyre both dna damage response proteins were directly targeting the hallmarks of cancer

12646 :  well they have to become incredibly reliant on a few proteins

12647 :  then a cell may divide when it shouldve instead stayed in stasis or even more likely shouldve been taken out of the population

12648 :  how to introduce herself

12649 :  just sit down

12650 :  so this is what we learn in the one room schoolhouse

12651 :  i kept thinking to myself there are a lot of people in this hospital who know a lot more than i do

12652 :  this is the scarecrow part that we learn about

12653 :  and i would say hey wait a second

12654 :  i had a good day

12655 :  and even if you think somethings free it invariably isnt

12656 :  osama bin laden did not have a facebook page

12657 :  and when it comes down to it the bad guys have a wealth of possibilities when they want to

12658 :  we should all be saying

12659 :  this is far more serious

12660 :  because no terrorist worth their salt is going to give anything away in an e mail or on the

12661 :  we all know weve been monitored all of the time

12662 :  how would they know

12663 :  we can all learn to be anonymous when we choose to be

12664 :  but we can move from the deep web

12665 :  this ultimately is going to have a terrible effect on the internet and it might get to the point where people

12666 :  and its true when they say

12667 :  how do they do that

12668 :  if you are not paying you are the product

12669 :  because they are very dangerous

12670 :  why should we get away from these arguments

12671 :  well obviously not

12672 :  in afghanistan it could have meant instead of concentrating on the big presidential and parliamentary elections we should

12673 :  is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy

12674 :  so its a starting point

12675 :  metaphor is probably the most powerful piece of political communication

12676 :  of course he could have said this a whole lot quicker

12677 :  boris johnson back in the uk hes talked about how the labor leader emanated

12678 :  im not asking twenty im not asking fifteen im not even asking ten
12679 :  and yet its a big lie isnt it

12680 :  and people who are emotional about something will therefore go over the top

12681 :  if you google calais and croissant you get just half a million results

12682 :  well three is the magic number in rhetoric

12683 :  but its complete nonsense

12684 :  balanced minds balanced diets balanced lives

12685 :  it sweeps people onto the next point which is free balance in statements

12686 :  whether or not theyll invest in a company whether or not they will back

12687 :  and theyre all lies and they are never challenged

12688 :  americas been waiting for someone who can really show leadership

12689 :  yesterday i was in london and i was watching one of my clients who is a big australian businessman

12690 :  and so he doesnt speak using the financial storm metaphor

12691 :  but its the bit no one ever talks about the elephant in the room so to speak which is extraordinary

12692 :  and whats the image this is planting in your mind

12693 :  so what im gonna do in my speech is revive this ancient art of rhetoric and share with you six

12694 :  in my time working in government we had tony blair and gordon brown described as two

12695 :  pope francis knows that its a big lie

12696 :  and so it should be of intense concern to us that this is a phrase that is being used now by the mainstream media

12697 :  and so im gong to demonstrate this now

12698 :  its a big lie

12699 :  he has a different metaphor

12700 :  id like one of you to throw me an issue

12701 :  this manifests in our speech

12702 :  lets move on to number six rhyme

12703 :  they can stay home and take care of anybodys children

12704 :  i talk to a lot of parents in the u

12705 :  and you know what

12706 :  or you write an essay and you tell about what youve done with it

12707 :  one day i was driving home from work listening to the radio and i remember listening to all these

12708 :  and we praised the effort we praised the process and not the result

12709 :  thats your job

12710 :  i take that job seriously i worry twentyfour seven
12711 :  im a proud mom

12712 :  take the time to help your kid discover what hes great at

12713 :  think about it whats your goal

12714 :  and to mentor kids so that eventually they can direct their own learning

12715 :  and this is the important step

12716 :  now its time to put them to use

12717 :  especially now my oldest son is off to university

12718 :  because then youre motivated to improve for the next time and youre inspired by the other peoples

12719 :  and if you want to do even better then you show up with a goal

12720 :  oh my gosh this is great

12721 :  what do i have to talk about

12722 :  know that petty rules stifle curiosity and creativity so have less rules and

12723 :  nobody died from losing

12724 :  why is this river orange

12725 :  he loved the history the environmental and political issues behind it and the chemistry

12726 :  or you want to write video about your project and its impact

12727 :  your job is to uncover your childs talents and help them develop them and help

12728 :  because if you live in the box its really hard to think outside of it

12729 :  so take the time to research opportunities for your kids

12730 :  when eric had fought hodgkins as a child learning the saxophone gave him the will to get up and go

12731 :  i could go on this stage for an hour telling you stories like that but dont worry i only have ten

12732 :  and the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the

12733 :  but of course theres another story to this building

12734 :  so we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut ten thousand little sticks and glued them onto a model

12735 :  and i think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in

12736 :  of course architecture is about function but i want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by bernard tschumi

12737 :  among the challenges that probably instantly come to mind would be academic challenges

12738 :  i didnt know

12739 :  i had no idea that there was a sequence of classes you were supposed to take in order to get your degree

12740 :  we also paid for this experience

12741 :  and this should come to mind because what we know is that fiftyone of new mexico high school graduates upon

12742 :  i had to make decisions that i didnt know what i was doing

12743 :  and i know a little something about this

12744 :  so i spent a semester analyzing horror films from start to end

12745 :  perhaps the most humorous example i can share with you was this special topics course i took titled

12746 :  among the things that we do is we take students on college campuses so that we bring college to life for

12747 :  well ill tell you what we do

12748 :  my parents were both high school dropouts and teen parents

12749 :  in two thousand and fourteen a study presented to the new mexico legislative finance committee indicated that when

12750 :  so what do we do

12751 :  we visit lecture halls and dorm rooms and dining services and we expose students to all the services that

12752 :  what im referring to is preparing students for the culture of college those spoken and unspoken rules

12753 :  but i dont think that their success should be hinged on luck

12754 :  we teach them the questions to ask

12755 :  additionally we mandate that students take dual enrollment courses so that they earn high school credit while

12756 :  how do we ensure that this does not happen

12757 :  so what is the moral of this story

12758 :  this is what were seeing

12759 :  who are they actually supposed to be informing

12760 :  today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have which is the choice overload

12761 :  take for example the ace hotels in new york and portland

12762 :  in some cases the most innovative and urban hotels have begun to define their

12763 :  in the process of doing that we took this hotel which was built in the height of aspens silver boom

12764 :  ill leave you with this final thought

12765 :  a hotel holds the promise every day of adventure and romance intrigue

12766 :  to do this were going to need three technologies to be good enough and none of them are there yet

12767 :  if you made one of me is that me or someone else

12768 :  for example your mind just always runs at the same speed but an em can add more or less computer hardware to run faster or slower

12769 :  and if we could do that everything would change

12770 :  now you might wonder why would ems let humans exist

12771 :  the idea is to port the software from the human brain

12772 :  i hate this

12773 :  i just wont remember what i did

12774 :  if you made one would it be conscious

12775 :  but they dont know much they cant influence much and theyre obsessed with the past so whats the point

12776 :  if you ask it to do things it might do them

12777 :  subjectively they remember a life of leisure

12778 :  first you have the follicular phase fascinating phase

12779 :  the first is you have to fall in love

12780 :  and its really interesting because we only ever reference that in a very basic way

12781 :  and being a now what solution kind of girl i said so now what

12782 :  its time to stop this experiment

12783 :  in fact you were right

12784 :  it turned out to be a pretty gross looking plant

12785 :  the only reason im able to investigate the bottoms of those lakes and rivers is because im a strong swimmer

12786 :  swimming is my way into the underwater world that some people never get to see

12787 :  what does your underwater world look like

12788 :  even though i believe that its terrible that people trash our lakes and rivers this isnt a talk about pollution its

12789 :  these weird clear blobs that look like jellyfish

12790 :  one time i was getting to the bottom of sam ponds searching for pollywogs when something slimy brushed up

12791 :  being in the water is never boring for me because i always find something fun to do like diving down

12792 :  all the fish were gone

12793 :  there was nothing to see

12794 :  and of course fish crawdads and rocks which are all supposed to be at the bottom of a lake or

12795 :  at that point i felt pretty ridiculous so i looked around to see if anybody was watching me

12796 :  rusty nails and rotten wood

12797 :  the tsunami wave bounced all the away from japan and hit hawaii and caused a lot damage where we were staying in the kona

12798 :  what is natural recovery

12799 :  that is exactly what this label is it is a life long thing

12800 :  i didnt know if i was an exceptional case or not i really didnt care all i know is that i had really big dreams

12801 :  i wasnt ready to carry the burden of a life long drug addict label

12802 :  but its not exactly what happened

12803 :  she had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she

12804 :  the biases whether intentional or otherwise are pervasive and so are the misleading mental

12805 :  microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self sufficiency and self respect but we must

12806 :  we have so much room to grow

12807 :  and when we talk about women they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to

12808 :  so maybe you could interview her

12809 :  why are you so passionate

12810 :  and she had come to washington not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan

12811 :  she sells chocolates

12812 :  and not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap

12813 :  and thats just to start

12814 :  and thats really how i became an entrepreneur

12815 :  we dont need to invent solutions because we have them cash flow loans based in income rather than

12816 :  so why wouldnt we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators

12817 :  but they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent

12818 :  org the microlender is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized

12819 :  i dont quote statistics because i think theyre all over the place

12820 :  he programmed my young mind

12821 :  how could that be possible

12822 :  and i went back with her to her apartment

12823 :  could we collaborate with women journalists without chains and not get co opted into

12824 :  we did capacity building

12825 :  right now we focus on top down

12826 :  and with half the population being female we deserve to have the female perspective

12827 :  i didnt even go to any parties working on my drawing

12828 :  i said yeah yeah

12829 :  open your eyes

12830 :  and what an amazing skill set

12831 :  you need to apply

12832 :  how empowering to be able to build whatever you want

12833 :  i loved the major and i wanted to do it

12834 :  just because this is the way things are doesnt mean its how they have to be

12835 :  so why does this matter

12836 :  only eleven percent of engineers in the u

12837 :  thats what engineers build

12838 :  and i was so worried that it was going to be my first f

12839 :  and our final assignment we had to put our drawings up on the wall for critique

12840 :  and so i would say well what is your favorite toy

12841 :  it will only get better with the female perspective

12842 :  i know you will

12843 :  but i stuck with it

12844 :  were not in a movie

12845 :  i have a degree

12846 :  the world was waiting for this

12847 :  and its so important that we include that perspective

12848 :  and they get them interested in math and science

12849 :  do you trust me

12850 :  she said okay debbie what do you plan to major in

12851 :  it couldnt be more rewarding

12852 :  what are you talking about

12853 :  you can do it and ill help you

12854 :  and we did do it

12855 :  this blastocyst is an amazingly complicated structure

12856 :  brian this might be the ultimate cosmic wild goose chase but we should do it

12857 :  this was incontrovertible proof that the earth was not the center of the solar system which was effectively

12858 :  you could fight for your country you could die for your country you could serve in your countrys civil service but you didnt

12859 :  how do we make it happen

12860 :  other examples are recycling

12861 :  we all know we need to recycle more

12862 :  and if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance of information that we have in our world today

12863 :  if you go down your house goes down

12864 :  your neighbor would be fine everyone around you

12865 :  were very susceptible to that

12866 :  what happens to our testosterone

12867 :  we had no idea how

12868 :  its almost inevitable

12869 :  theres a feeling of inevitability that somethings going to happen in london

12870 :  and i think only by doing that can we really base the stands of our democracy

12871 :  and none of this had to be consciously directed

12872 :  we have hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets

12873 :  and it shouldnt be allowed to stand

12874 :  i stumbled across one of the five different facebook pages which were going

12875 :  i find out about the london plans in the way as most people do

12876 :  in the same way we can see now its a mistake leaving politics up to the politicians

12877 :  but theres another dimension to this which i think is worth thinking about

12878 :  and although i didnt realise it at the time or fully appreciated it at the time once you have a deep sense that

12879 :  we had no idea that we were going to end up outside saint pauls cathedral for five months

12880 :  i think wed made provision for a generator to turn up for day two if we managed to stay overnight

12881 :  it was what was happening to a young welsh american soldier in military detention in the

12882 :  for one thing you are aiming to occupy outside the stock exchange

12883 :  this is a picture of the complex that controls the movement of the cell

12884 :  when i was in high school i was so passionate in art and design that every time my teacher turned her

12885 :  well they help us both with reading and writing the data

12886 :  its almost set it and forget it

12887 :  why specifically magnetic bacteria

12888 :  with rotten i changed improved and refined it until we got to a concept

12889 :  each of them has one or more chains of tiny magnetic crystals called magnetisms

12890 :  and this allows us the fantastic ability of having our data duplicate itself

12891 :  like rotem i found it fascinating and spent the next few weeks digging up information on magnetic bacteria

12892 :  we learned through our research that the financial lives of the poor are incredibly complex

12893 :  to watch your husband waste your familys money and to see your kids go to bed hungry

12894 :  she explained to us that her husband was alcoholic abusive and adulterous

12895 :  so we asked what would that be like

12896 :  to o is also a great example of how the poor can be incredibly innovative at designing

12897 :  and i never forgot that and to this day i still take those words very much to heart and

12898 :  we have to capture that knowledge and help these retiring workers to pass it on to the next

12899 :  with cte students study careers in industry and business and connect with people in those

12900 :  we have thirty employees and manufacture a variety of plastic parts

12901 :  so we have to surround the xenon by various shields

12902 :  wimps are an example for the so called cold dark matter which means that under the influence of gravity they

12903 :  so you are under tremendous pressure because i dont give you instruction and yet you have to guess my mind

12904 :  thats the first one

12905 :  what about the eyes

12906 :  and thats what makes them into partners

12907 :  what do you think karajans reply was

12908 :  you know why

12909 :  it doesnt work

12910 :  its not that

12911 :  so he had to resign

12912 :  you have this control

12913 :  so can we express this idea that magical moment of where the practical meets the possible

12914 :  and if you move any slower than that then youre moving too slow any further than that and youre just dreaming

12915 :  start with five ok

12916 :  but really what can it express

12917 :  can you express that in music

12918 :  again within the context of whats happening in terms of how information is being curtailed in ways that a lot of us

12919 :  imagine a world without free knowledge

12920 :  gay lesbian bi transgender or straight we need you to go all out to build this historic movement for

12921 :  what a lot of people dont know about is this website

12922 :  globalgiving they come regularly to india as well conducting workshops

12923 :  will you join us

12924 :  for example one of the really interesting things that she does or she used to do through the blog is highlight cases where

12925 :  and this is something you should check out

12926 :  everybody knows about what happened in egypt the revolution in egypt

12927 :  in fact every major household name is allowing you to interact with their

12928 :  when i got these results i started talking to doctors and they told me not to tell anyone and my reaction is is that going to help

12929 :  it cannot be used by people who arent credentialed

12930 :  it wasnt the point

12931 :  it cant be integrated

12932 :  we just have better statistics

12933 :  whats wrong with you

12934 :  people you dont know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you and when i tell cancer survivors

12935 :  it just takes all of some of us

12936 :  its to be naked digitally in public

12937 :  it cant be networked

12938 :  its not the most science positive state lg

12939 :  he had this hypothesis and he tested it in people

12940 :  the fourth stage means

12941 :  thats why i like what i do

12942 :  we started to think about what does everyone want and need and how to build an

12943 :  her perpetrator was arrested but three dollars was enough for the police to wipe his name from the

12944 :  i have no formal education

12945 :  what do they do

12946 :  people who dont have advocates support systems built in

12947 :  but wesleyan said yes and gave kennedy a full scholarship

12948 :  and he said well what are they going to say

12949 :  i had five thousand followers on polyvore and nine thousand combined followers on tumblr

12950 :  so what do i do on youtube

12951 :  i was and still am terrified of public speaking

12952 :  i had to figure out how to put those on

12953 :  ericsson was actually saying is it takes ten thousand hours to get at the top of an ultra

12954 :  its not true

12955 :  and eventually becoming pretty good at something

12956 :  this i cannot treat

12957 :  he had to have some mistakes

12958 :  thats not necessarily a bad unintended consequence

12959 :  how long should we persist

12960 :  one day i saw a seventy year old man a patient whose chief complaint was

12961 :  a long strain of very innovative product launches without a serious misstep

12962 :  in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight i was a first year emergency medicine resident at charity hospital in new orleans

12963 :  everyone was fully engaged during the presentation and everyone made mistakes

12964 :  he mustve found a way to keep the errors and failings on the inside of the company

12965 :  for example during his second tenure at apple steve jobs would select one hundred of the smartest people

12966 :  so i asked him

12967 :  i couldve made the same error

12968 :  how long should we continue to fail

12969 :  youre not as objective as you think

12970 :  but were facing a stark dilemma where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth

12971 :  tokyo with thirtyfive million people is one of the largest and some might say safest urban

12972 :  if you live in rio im sorry shave off two right there

12973 :  in other words ten times more people are dying outside of war than inside war

12974 :  they know we exist they know theres an outside world

12975 :  western medicine cant touch those

12976 :  if you have an infection go to a doctor

12977 :  and in the next few years what we discovered as a group was that yeast cells do in fact grow old

12978 :  now we could find genes that could actually slow that process down

12979 :  they were protected against cancer

12980 :  i think anyone whos been a parent knows how this feels

12981 :  they operated on her

12982 :  it was really exciting

12983 :  they were protected against alzheimers

12984 :  the same number of genes but they arent all switched on at the same time

12985 :  alzheimers heart disease cancer these are natural and we do everything we can to prevent and

12986 :  we dont have to worry

12987 :  she went straight to hospital

12988 :  i really look forward to a day when this happens and when it does i believe were going to look back at today like we do

12989 :  we were surprised

12990 :  we didnt realize resveratrol and these drugs all work the same way but they do

12991 :  in every one of your cells

12992 :  i said i like the body language

12993 :  i said i cant mr

12994 :  you dont choose the spoken word

12995 :  you can stay with me for twenty years go tomorrow

12996 :  you dont know her

12997 :  she doesnt know the language

12998 :  this is what we teach in the night schools

12999 :  i like the way she speaks

13000 :  there are no contracts no written contracts

13001 :  theyre all over the world

13002 :  they only had islamic education very little of it

13003 :  they look at me like im crazy they check the calendar to make sure its not april fools

13004 :  so eventually we want to have a suite of products and programs that work with other brands and sports leagues to

13005 :  and i saw marks face just lose all of its exuberance

13006 :  at the end of every game id calculate my statistics close my eyes and imagine stuart scott reading those

13007 :  how would you go about doing that

13008 :  i started tutoring kids

13009 :  what if the enemy finds out

13010 :  and he says theyre their personnel records

13011 :  and he said well you found them

13012 :  we had to share

13013 :  i think there are two parts of this

13014 :  but as i was talking to my intelligence officer i said what do we do

13015 :  we had to change our culture about information

13016 :  we want our language back

13017 :  for all of the times i had to learn how to offer myself back to myself

13018 :  you already cant vote what makes you think that youre allowed to live here

13019 :  you are a reason to wake up every morning you are a reason to wake up every morning thats why i offer you this

13020 :  so if you wanted to create a global brand youd start with a global perspective

13021 :  you might get some experts from around the world

13022 :  well have that supermarket special offer

13023 :  now what good branding does is it does manage to connect with people to touch people on their

13024 :  and often when people talk about brands they can forget that some of the worlds most powerful brands most influential brands

13025 :  i guess what we all want is for democracy to really succeed

13026 :  im feeling very happy everyday

13027 :  things like silly putty totally accidental

13028 :  in the forms of rumor

13029 :  cover your lemon and be kind to people

13030 :  cover your lemon okay

13031 :  but shes silent

13032 :  you know and theres beauty to be found in a mess

13033 :  its only then that we give up control and we accidentally stumble on things and we test things we take

13034 :  lets say you have a problem youre trying to solve

13035 :  im now face to face with the grumpy butcher

13036 :  the building behind me is located at penn state university

13037 :  i just wandered around taking photos like this one just for something to do

13038 :  i happen to know what the consequence for me would be because weve had false alarms

13039 :  they get interested in something

13040 :  yes technologically its very sophisticated but everybody gets the idea

13041 :  of eight and eleven
13042 :  now i might be at ground zero for this

13043 :  i try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate

13044 :  to begin with its going to be a society thats way in advance of our own

13045 :  but here are a couple things i can say

13046 :  seti on the other hand is really simple

13047 :  so that doesnt get people interested in science because they cant comprehend what its about

13048 :  whats the consequence

13049 :  i also think that exploration is important in terms of being able to address

13050 :  i had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour

13051 :  you dont get one kitten

13052 :  youve got to get them there

13053 :  theres no doubt about it

13054 :  instead of saying a dutch girl playing salsa that cant be right

13055 :  my first album was received very well in colombia

13056 :  did you read it

13057 :  it was kind of the baby steps of a fiction writer

13058 :  it was a lot of fantasy a lot of my desires

13059 :  i felt betrayed by my family

13060 :  my mothers there my brothers there

13061 :  it may have been obvious but i hadnt come out yet to my family

13062 :  hes a very macho guy

13063 :  did you read it

13064 :  i grew up in a small town

13065 :  i had to visit the trauma again i had to go back and think about my

13066 :  eventually i got out

13067 :  and i started writing about my family as a way to get back to my family

13068 :  and people ask me was this a cathartic experience writing this novel

13069 :  i had to understand that my parents loved me

13070 :  i look at my brother

13071 :  and they said yeah its okay you can do that

13072 :  this is simply not possible theres always something bad around

13073 :  and when you think about it a little bit it does make sense because our brain is very isolated

13074 :  then i think stop

13075 :  and i used to not be a great fan of public restrooms but now i can go anywhere because i

13076 :  but just knowing about these kinds of research thats out there at the moment helps me in my daily

13077 :  i thought that was nice

13078 :  you play the key role

13079 :  you are not allowed to eat for six hours and thats a long time

13080 :  your hormone insulin is one of the most important hormones to keep your body in a healthy balance

13081 :  in normal life you can lose some weight and its not a problem

13082 :  so they could well be in a spectrum like this

13083 :  but in high concentrations once again you dont want this stuff in your beer because nobody likes to drink a pint of butter

13084 :  out of all those molecules that were missing at the moment we have no information on where their peaks

13085 :  so starting off with this question can we make beer in space

13086 :  that s what i thought

13087 :  but they can be a bit like geologists

13088 :  i trained as a doctor about thirty years ago

13089 :  when you break a bone it grows back

13090 :  but the time that i m referring to happened two hundred and fifty millions years ago

13091 :  my eyelids felt a little heavy i opened them and i was on the wrong side of the road with a car speeding

13092 :  id worked about one hundred and twelve hours in this week

13093 :  this is what to remind yourself of when you re in a dip

13094 :  and what they left us

13095 :  how about that

13096 :  so now weve got the insight

13097 :  a ratio that wouldnt have been as exact

13098 :  he said well why didnt you use a ratio

13099 :  they might be winning ideas they might be losing ideas i will know as i develop them

13100 :  in reality youre getting nothing from the lesson and youre really writing an awful email out i hope youre not

13101 :  they did lots of exams failed plenty of them passed some and

13102 :  maybe something small again think small dont think of a big thing

13103 :  when it comes to developing any kind of idea in shaolin culture we start thinking small

13104 :  by having a so called unreachable dream we can work to create a better society it assists us in

13105 :  but these are the dreamers the thinkers i think we need for society to progress

13106 :  especially on your own

13107 :  a true dream is not measurable

13108 :  so lets begin right now

13109 :  sometimes they dont even seem attainable

13110 :  how can we dream big when we can only dream for the specific thing visible to us

13111 :  i didnt even recognize it as my own mistake

13112 :  its a good amount of weight dont you think

13113 :  and one of the difficulties about walking into your life about coming into this

13114 :  she said i burned a letter and two postcards

13115 :  i said astonishing

13116 :  the most powerful moment i had on the whole camino was when i realized i myself

13117 :  so really this first ritual is saying how did you get to this place

13118 :  and when you get to santiago actually it can be something of an anticlimax because

13119 :  but its quite astonishing how little time we spend at this conversational frontier

13120 :  twenty three years old and you have paper

13121 :  because you have to ask for help

13122 :  to break your heart

13123 :  the first ritual is to eat a tapas plate of scallops or if youre

13124 :  im sorry you have chosen them out unconsciously for that exact core

13125 :  i said i work with the conversational nature of reality

13126 :  you look at parenting yeah

13127 :  its holding you back

13128 :  but all you have to do is take a language approach and math becomes intuitive and easy to understand

13129 :  just remember that math is a language and use that to your advantage

13130 :  and thats why kids are confused

13131 :  math is a human language so we all have the ability to understand it

13132 :  then i asked her a question that kindergartners are definitely not supposed to know

13133 :  let me show you what i mean

13134 :  she couldnt factor or solve equations and she had no confidence in math

13135 :  how was math ever human in the first place

13136 :  as a result this teenager had no confidence in herself

13137 :  one of those problems is

13138 :  so i started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way police use

13139 :  same police district

13140 :  if australia had to send one thousand people tomorrow to west papua for example we dont have

13141 :  the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas

13142 :  that you use nonlethal weapons first so your lethal weapons will actually be more effective

13143 :  so you feel this massive heat and you go i want to get out of the way

13144 :  if the person doesnt follow directions they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either

13145 :  the police ministers and a heap of public statements were made about it

13146 :  theyd released a bunch of people but they still had about seven hundred people hostage

13147 :  they were holding something like seven hundred people hostage

13148 :  so again theyd say with access to nonlethal weapons if weve got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them

13149 :  she took up a more threatening position in her bed

13150 :  the people youll be shooting at wont be able to get out of the way

13151 :  theyre trained to think more to try and de escalate

13152 :  i was really surprised

13153 :  i looked at it

13154 :  another child within weeks of tasering the six year old boy

13155 :  theres probably a breakthru coming here

13156 :  the cement like composite can be formed into several different shapes which results in an extremely versatile

13157 :  so that began a lifetime of educator serial monogamy

13158 :  if you did a root cause analysis to get to the why of most educators it comes back to a

13159 :  it gives them a chance to make their dreams become a reality

13160 :  you want more informed electorate and who doesnt

13161 :  love emboldens them to try to come up with

13162 :  you are who you are

13163 :  i get the point

13164 :  and then the fourth step you go to what is called lovely love

13165 :  he went back

13166 :  sometimes they were unfriendly

13167 :  nice for him to say it but i cant do that

13168 :  brothers can fight

13169 :  so he said all right

13170 :  and he became interested in that

13171 :  and hes freaked out

13172 :  and so again he goes back

13173 :  i had fights with them

13174 :  you can develop this

13175 :  he went back to his cave

13176 :  nobody seems alien

13177 :  and maitreya says i was with you

13178 :  they could all be just fine

13179 :  so buddhas teaching has lost its momentum

13180 :  so that encouraged him and he went with maitreya

13181 :  and that is very important the charter of compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion

13182 :  so naturally they chased him out of town

13183 :  so my mother in this life is really great

13184 :  and you look at them and you see how they are

13185 :  and we see the mother in every being

13186 :  you will even weep perhaps with gratitude and kindness

13187 :  and maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years dictating to him five complicated

13188 :  there is no way not to do it

13189 :  when theyre angry they look ugly every being but when theyre happy they look beautiful

13190 :  they would be relaxing somewhere having a good time

13191 :  im not going to fail that

13192 :  and how will they transform our social structures

13193 :  in light of these trends

13194 :  but on the other hand if you are going to take drugs you have a reasonably good

13195 :  another called twister and so on and so on

13196 :  naval intelligence project

13197 :  and eventually the church came to recognize saints as more than just people worthy of

13198 :  and i think that were having a somewhat different college experience because of the different types of

13199 :  we process disagreement as an attack and go into defense mode

13200 :  well in my opinion i think you need advocacy in order to effectively

13201 :  now the people who were clamoring for this individual to be proclaimed a saint

13202 :  you see since then ive experienced over and over how people feel that a

13203 :  i just think that my generations lack of experience in managing our reputations

13204 :  and thats why i want to talk to you today about the devils advocate the role the promoter of faith played in the

13205 :  we go into our reptile brains and we just stop thinking

13206 :  but in the modern era you dont really have a lot of eyewitnesses

13207 :  so i think in that sense your experience has perhaps better prepared you to be

13208 :  but my very candid suitemate in that moment said something that was guaranteed to please no one and im

13209 :  change can only happen when someone is willing to speak in opposition and can be heard

13210 :  we are judging people every second of the day

13211 :  we were just a lot more naive

13212 :  now the postulators primary role and responsibility was to seek out all evidence in favor of

13213 :  studies show that we form an opinion about people within the first seven seconds that we encounter them

13214 :  by the 1960s the church needed to modernize and pope john xxiii convened

13215 :  i get into the aircraft join my fellow passengers

13216 :  so designers need to be all over this process

13217 :  now this vehicle is an object lesson in being the right tool for the job

13218 :  and theyll have around the walls some smart boards so that there they can see the progress they make

13219 :  now heres a cool thing about your voice

13220 :  it doesnt even matter if you agree with this or not

13221 :  and luckily for me that day my father was home early

13222 :  where are they

13223 :  i escaped i ran home in tears

13224 :  you have to embrace who you are and embrace who others are

13225 :  dont look at the negative in someone and look at the positive

13226 :  but there are a lot of my friends whod kill for it

13227 :  thats the way i like my toast

13228 :  it takes more energy to hate than to love

13229 :  i honestly hate my eye colour it looks like cat pee

13230 :  so i cut a few slices off a loaf of bread i put them onto a plate and then i put them right into the

13231 :  you can be more

13232 :  where was the printing press

13233 :  of that four is remembered positively seven is remembered negatively eightynine isnt

13234 :  one thousand advertising messages a day youre exposed to

13235 :  everything else will fall into place

13236 :  he cant break the windows

13237 :  if we learn how that works

13238 :  we dont understand the media obviously we dont understand what were doing

13239 :  i dont know

13240 :  the neighbor calls the police the police call the ambulance they get him out the car

13241 :  do you notice one thing on there that isnt changing

13242 :  be a bit more dog

13243 :  i was that guy who if i ever said yes to being invited out to some social function was in the corner on his

13244 :  i believe we can fundamentally reverse trends in loneliness and as a result of that change

13245 :  i worked every weekend

13246 :  he wasnt interested in my resume a big list

13247 :  theres no doubt about that

13248 :  hes an ex british

13249 :  and i was so super confident that i of course expected her to say yes

13250 :  but i also learned that i was going to suffer from lack of bladder control bowel control sexual

13251 :  ive got problems

13252 :  but this time it wasnt temporary

13253 :  they dont like to be called army

13254 :  hes actually ex royal marines

13255 :  and remarkably she said yes

13256 :  and i appreciate if youve got to check with your health and safety people to accept my entry

13257 :  unable to tell the time unable to tell if it was day or night when i went to bed for five minutes and

13258 :  and earlier this year i spent three months in ucla working with reggie and yury combining my

13259 :  but i was building up to the big point

13260 :  i would have spasms neuropathic pain infections

13261 :  rugby cricket hockey

13262 :  that is they keep us alive they get us into wheelchairs and we can go and live life

13263 :  its exciting stuff

13264 :  and as i break the device they redesign it and retrofit all the devices around the world

13265 :  it is remarkable that the formal medical structure has turned spinal injuries into a predictable

13266 :  tony im blind

13267 :  a lesion could pop up in the speech center of your brain causing you to talk funny

13268 :  its then at that point unable to see straight use my dominant hand or feel three quarters of my body that even

13269 :  am i going to end up in a wheelchair

13270 :  i somehow made my way back to the locker room and i called my teacher

13271 :  she wasnt particularly good at it which i accepted as a personal challenge because neurology is my passion

13272 :  note the absence of deep tendon reflexes i exclaimed as she unsuccessfully taped on my knees with the reflex

13273 :  when this happens you have a few choices

13274 :  maybe i had pinched a nerve while weightlifting

13275 :  maybe even use it to make the world a better place

13276 :  well ms is sort of the same situation

13277 :  i dont know when the next relapse is coming or what its going to do to me

13278 :  i dont know if tomorrow is going to be a good day or a bad one

13279 :  in fact it was pretty much the opposite

13280 :  i was finally giving anesthesia for the first time as a student

13281 :  recovery from a relapse is not guaranteed and theres no way to know with certainty whether a loss of function is

13282 :  in addition to the variety of symptoms therere also a few different types of ms

13283 :  im not having a relapse right now but the ms version of remission is different than you might think

13284 :  i brushed it off hoping that it was just a sports injury

13285 :  its a lot to take in

13286 :  and thats how i became a board certified ms nurse just six months after being diagnosed with

13287 :  then i decided to put my knowledge to use in the best way a graduate student knows how

13288 :  cut the amount of time and money that it takes to run a study

13289 :  by taking an exam

13290 :  am i going to die from this

13291 :  i never know whats around the corner

13292 :  maybe even get us towards a cure faster

13293 :  my mission is to educate empower and help work towards a day when a young

13294 :  were hoping that by crowdsourcing a huge data bank that researchers can tap into

13295 :  well in estonia their e residency program asks users for feedback to such a

13296 :  they have really powerful processes

13297 :  their job is to help the group decide

13298 :  so how can i be so sure about this

13299 :  and so this used to be understandable right

13300 :  and the answer is its already happening

13301 :  and thats what democracy is

13302 :  we couldnt vote on every issue because the only technology we had was pen and paper and a

13303 :  so dont get me wrong

13304 :  we choose one ideology and we adopt it wholesale

13305 :  and i am going to tell you this one thing from a slightly outside perspective as ive mentioned to you i am swiss french though ive

13306 :  and so i am turning to my mom who is sitting right here next to me of course she didnt

13307 :  you see i found a way to turn this passion of mine into a career

13308 :  and so well see a grumpy cat movie in the next couple of years

13309 :  since that day i think its safe to say that i was raised without knowing it as a pop culture

13310 :  i was in costa rica running away from my problems

13311 :  ill never forget it

13312 :  whatever they are pursue them

13313 :  even though i knew more people i didnt really know anyone

13314 :  i wanted to be spontaneous and set my own schedule

13315 :  and it happened by getting to know other peoples stories and being willing to let them get to know mine

13316 :  oh so you thought by traveling you could run away from your problems

13317 :  i was sitting at this cafe in san jos having a morning coffee and i was reading a book and the

13318 :  i made significant progress and i felt more comfortable talking to people but there was still one

13319 :  its funny how these things work sometimes

13320 :  to be happy i started doing things i was proud of

13321 :  the trip was supposed to last for forty days and it lasted twelve and those twelve days were full of stress and

13322 :  finally my challenge to you is this

13323 :  why was i the one being rejected

13324 :  youve got to make that choice for yourself

13325 :  mine was when i realized that if i could change the circumstances i would and when that light bulb went off i knew

13326 :  so whats your turning point going to be

13327 :  five days later my girlfriend broke up with me

13328 :  its amazing its challenging but its also fun

13329 :  well to me it signals something bigger that dna technology is finally within the reach

13330 :  we started working in our basements

13331 :  if its a bad enough virus the health of your herd may be gone in the blink of an eye

13332 :  our goal was to bring dna science to more people in new places

13333 :  even bacteria and some viruses have dna too

13334 :  last year he traveled to sierra leone

13335 :  and its a rare fungus

13336 :  picture that youre seeing fifteen sunsets and sunrises every day

13337 :  your animals are your familys sole source of income as long as theyre healthy

13338 :  and its at times like this that profound transformation is bound to happen moments when a

13339 :  today farmers can take those samples themselves

13340 :  the ripples of the personal dna revolution may be hard to predict but one thing is certain

13341 :  so we do know how to stop ebola and these strategies work ladies and gentlemen

13342 :  the virus was stopped in nigeria by these four strategies and the people implementing them obviously

13343 :  can we ever stop ebola when it starts to spread like this

13344 :  to help these countries which were in so much trouble and concern at that time

13345 :  but what we saw was something very different

13346 :  when our relatives die we cant take care of them as our tradition demands

13347 :  people are part of the problem but people are the solution to all of these environmental issues

13348 :  i hope you get to know chief almir today you will find hes very persistent and he is very persuasive

13349 :  he also told us

13350 :  he traveled thousands of miles and many days

13351 :  they dont understand

13352 :  weve all been tattooed

13353 :  im not asking you for help id like to have a partnership

13354 :  chief almir came to google and he asked us

13355 :  a small tribe

13356 :  and these are our photons that we use in these color experiments to teleport

13357 :  we are going on

13358 :  i thought how much money do i have in my pocket

13359 :  but also for the newcomers

13360 :  so we cannot stay here its dangerous

13361 :  whilst i was making some of these teeny tiny roses

13362 :  what else could i do with paper

13363 :  people said to us can i go in first

13364 :  so i wanted to know more

13365 :  which therefore meant that i didnt have to wait and watch glue dry

13366 :  female genital mutilation was something i found out about so completely accidentally whilst at

13367 :  so when im facing on doing something really monotonous and really laborious i have to watch

13368 :  it kind of stuck together by itself

13369 :  so then i became that person trying to wonder how or if i could ask my friends to

13370 :  now i literally sat for hours and hours by myself in my living room making even

13371 :  she tells her friends and family

13372 :  what i am trying to do is im trying to bring those two views into one so that my images

13373 :  and as a result during the treasure rescue just one hundred and sixty penguins died

13374 :  penguins are very vocal birds and really really noisy so i expected to walk into this

13375 :  the oil slick was now moving north towards dassen island and the rescuers despaired because they

13376 :  and truly to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding

13377 :  and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming

13378 :  i was instantly transported back to that moment in time

13379 :  we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing but

13380 :  so in these six years between these two oil spills theyve built thousands of these well ventilated

13381 :  so in wildlife rescue as in life we learn from each previous experience and

13382 :  just look at that seventeen year old

13383 :  personally i learned that i am capable of handling so much more than i ever dreamed possible

13384 :  in fact many people compared it to a war zone

13385 :  and was silvia gaus right

13386 :  so if we each do our part together we can make a difference and we can help keep penguins

13387 :  and with that call my life would change forever

13388 :  humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins but we are now their only hope

13389 :  and theyd been using it at sanccob with great success so they began using it during the treasure rescue

13390 :  well she could not be more wrong

13391 :  we took a problem that many people said was impossible and we made it possible and we persevered when it looked like

13392 :  with the right temperatures times and chemicals we finally got that successful test result showing us that we had

13393 :  my team hypothesized that we could use the carbon thats already in styrofoam to create activated

13394 :  so why did we keep trying when all the adults said it was impossible

13395 :  for the longest time we had to rely on these faculties because we did not have any alternatives

13396 :  why should you care about industrial robots

13397 :  until she was reaching as wide as she could reach

13398 :  even though all these voices around me said thats not reasonable

13399 :  i ignored those voices and i moved forward

13400 :  i read the back of the book i thought it was interesting

13401 :  i didnt know what the hell i was doing

13402 :  about a year and a half ago my husband and i and our kids moved

13403 :  and wed say no

13404 :  she was really my only parent

13405 :  id never heard of this trail

13406 :  i was living in minnesota at the time i was a waitress and i was standing in line at an

13407 :  i keep saying we moved but actually my husband whos in the room a very extraordinary man but

13408 :  and the answer was always no

13409 :  i was out there ninetyfour days

13410 :  i have an excuse as to why my basement is so hideous

13411 :  and that suffering was the greatest that i had ever suffered

13412 :  that strength was a very humble thing

13413 :  i did all kinds of things

13414 :  she was in her

13415 :  and i knew it was important

13416 :  how could it not be good for me

13417 :  i have done most of my life

13418 :  dont put so much work on yourself

13419 :  i want to do a speech

13420 :  and all you know about this patient is that theres a tumor about the size of a golf ball or so in the right frontal lobe of this

13421 :  its not just the best doctors could offer patients with brain cancer generally

13422 :  were actually not doing that well all across the board with cancer

13423 :  and i started looking more and more into this

13424 :  for me it was mostly outrage

13425 :  he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer

13426 :  i dont think we quite won this war yet and i dont think anyone here will question that

13427 :  i was just outraged that how come this is the best that we can offer

13428 :  and thats more or less it

13429 :  a lot of things are going through your head

13430 :  its magical thing

13431 :  three simple words you can do right now

13432 :  theres no single recipe that will increase your happiness at all times and for

13433 :  tell me more and what happened next

13434 :  we had thousands of clicks hundreds of e mails

13435 :  and so we did exactly that

13436 :  putting them there made them more recognizable

13437 :  a recent global survey found that seventythree percent of the top media management jobs are still held by men

13438 :  the problem is of course there arent enough women in newsrooms

13439 :  i used to say to myself you aint shit

13440 :  i am beautiful

13441 :  i am a leader with an impeccable drive

13442 :  i am a diamond faceted with many cuts

13443 :  thank you very much

13444 :  there are seven questions

13445 :  they can surprise us all

13446 :  not very well it turns out

13447 :  lemur hunting has decreased education levels are on the rise and lemur populations are thriving in

13448 :  is it money in the bank

13449 :  now today according to the iucn red data list ninetyone
13450 :  the kids in lavavolo do not have access to basic education

13451 :  however on the other hand madagascar is a place of incredible wealth a wealth of

13452 :  how do we define wealth

13453 :  now sadly because of that extreme poverty many of those lemurs were hunted and a lot of the forest

13454 :  and as i look around me today i see an incredible amount of wealth right here a wealth of knowledge

13455 :  as they must be as each day is a struggle for mere survival

13456 :  the island inhabits twentythree million people with a three percent growth rate

13457 :  now when i first arrived in lavavolo i thought for sure this is the poorest region of the

13458 :  andrea lives on the island of madagascar where ninetyfive percent of the local people are subsistence

13459 :  along my journey i have come to find that the poorest people the ones with the least amount of money in their pockets have been the

13460 :  so like in real life when the protagonist dies alone in the arctic maybe gets eaten by a

13461 :  the difference is alcohol is a very effective social lubricant up to a certain point

13462 :  but face to face communication and online communication are actually in conflict as they battle

13463 :  side by side yet they couldnt have been further apart

13464 :  you could be on fire and they probably wouldnt notice

13465 :  the internet has brought people together in the most incredible of ways

13466 :  it was a can of worms i didnt want to open

13467 :  and its traditionally been the go to social prop for many

13468 :  they are barely even know youre there

13469 :  if youve ever tried to have a conversation with someone whilst theyre gazing into their phone you will notice after a

13470 :  problem was pretty much everyone else had

13471 :  we must try harder than that

13472 :  it makes you feel good

13473 :  isnt it why were here

13474 :  the only time we are able to break out of this bubble perspective is when we communicate

13475 :  the brain gets just ten of its information from the optic nerve

13476 :  so we are already living in a virtual reality of our own making even without our

13477 :  that was when you bonded that was when the magic happened

13478 :  so we perceive nothing as what it really is

13479 :  and parallel universes

13480 :  they wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes

13481 :  and its only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether its testable

13482 :  you have your interpretation

13483 :  so ill tell you

13484 :  like ralph said

13485 :  we took the lamp back to the university and we thought ok we have to do something about it

13486 :  and we were like why

13487 :  so it can go lighting up from the bottom to the top

13488 :  one two three then it stops and then it goes all the way down

13489 :  make you be part of the movie

13490 :  now machines have the ability to store an unlimited amount of

13491 :  so back to where it all started of this talk

13492 :  and thats how i discovered my purpose in life

13493 :  and actually from that day on shes been comfortable with us

13494 :  measure the sentiment of those tweets

13495 :  well when twitter started that was a huge problem right

13496 :  it turns out when were bummed out we buy things that make us feel better

13497 :  how does colorado feel today

13498 :  you want to manage your supply chain youre the manager at a store and you want to change what promotions you have

13499 :  couches and refrigerators and new cars

13500 :  or isnt that just polling

13501 :  can we start to figure out how does the country feel today

13502 :  you can also take adjectives and make them into nouns

13503 :  absquatulate is a perfectly good word of english

13504 :  motel is a blend of motor and hotel

13505 :  now these kinds of natural rules that exist in your brain theyre not like traffic laws theyre

13506 :  and new words grab peoples attention

13507 :  so these are blend words like brunch is a blend of breakfast and lunch

13508 :  so weve been talking about this for a long time

13509 :  i do believe the sound on this instrument is much more interesting than the sound of my own voice

13510 :  what do you do with the fat kid to keep him from watching knight rider reruns all day

13511 :  the bass isnt narrow enough

13512 :  so the question is

13513 :  i went to a university on the west coast of the us called walla walla university its a sister college of my

13514 :  this statistic not only suggest that men are experiencing significant problems

13515 :  why arent we all over this

13516 :  green buildings should be the mainstream but if you go outside walk around downtown or through your neighborhood youll see

13517 :  we need sunlight and green grass and fresh air

13518 :  or maybe even cure polio

13519 :  each type of bacteria glows in a different color and gets a command to divide and flourish under a different

13520 :  so they said why not take regular bacteria to put inside some genes which will allow it

13521 :  schwarz in the weizmann institute searching for some kind of cure

13522 :  so they prefer to commit suicide

13523 :  into a better future in which we could maybe eradicate diseases such as cancer

13524 :  i can take from someone s feces his own bacteria to install onto the bacteria some software

13525 :  and thus to eliminate the very severe and sometimes deadly side effects caused by treatments nowadays

13526 :  our skin cells are so smart that they can sense that they have been mutated to the point in which skin

13527 :  am i making this up

13528 :  nine identical its so appealing that this idea was seized upon by

13529 :  in the end he chose to no longer be scared after all they were going to beat him anyway why be scared

13530 :  i havent tried it

13531 :  he chose to no longer feel hungry again

13532 :  i went in and bought point six two

13533 :  so ultimately when i look it back at what doing to shanghai did to me twelve years ago what happened is i

13534 :  you meet people

13535 :  next he focused on the beatings

13536 :  and the hunger went

13537 :  the next day they didnt beat him either or the next day

13538 :  and you find the freedom to try new things and to do new things which you wouldnt have otherwise

13539 :  they beat everyone else but him

13540 :  what are you curious about

13541 :  youre so brave to be going away to china to give up your job in england and so on but honestly i didnt feel

13542 :  and yet we all suffer from self doubt

13543 :  i really would love to connect to her

13544 :  what was i thinking

13545 :  we need a lot of courage

13546 :  of course it matters

13547 :  why should she like the music

13548 :  we take a magnifying glass and we look at our behaviors

13549 :  after two minutes i take my eyes off her and shes on her phone

13550 :  we know who we are

13551 :  where everything is made out of cardboard

13552 :  cardboard is light weight its foldable and its very easy to recycle

13553 :  to see if it was still dry from the inside

13554 :  and actually when you think about it its not that crazy after all

13555 :  and there i spoke to a guy that was doing something with sustainable cardboard beach houses

13556 :  five meters and five meters high became visible

13557 :  that was actually one of our luckiest things during the process because as soon as the tents arrived a huge truck

13558 :  we should make a tent out of cardboard

13559 :  and i went with him to the event in rotterdam

13560 :  i was like couldnt publish what

13561 :  this isnt about politics

13562 :  thats why facebook wants to collect all the data it can about you

13563 :  i can ignore that

13564 :  its an algorithm picking what it thinks that you might be interested in and maybe not find on

13565 :  thats why you see it in every supermarket

13566 :  for most people their encounters with poultry are when theyre in the supermarket shopping or when

13567 :  and then sometimes i actually stop myself and think

13568 :  the defenders of the industry say its necessary because the birds are aggressive

13569 :  before i stopped eating animals chicken was my favourite meat

13570 :  if duck was on the menu thats what id order

13571 :  us humans have made a great art at the disconnect about what it is we actually eat

13572 :  as quickly as possible

13573 :  i was intrigued

13574 :  the vagus nerve is a nerve that goes to the back of your head and goes throughout your whole body

13575 :  so i want you to tip forward inhale let your belly go

13576 :  it was time for a change

13577 :  we know the importance of the breath

13578 :  ancient yogis say we come into this world with a certain number of breaths and we can take them

13579 :  come up from the back of your seat

13580 :  take your hands

13581 :  we would breathe through one nostril then the other we would do breath holds

13582 :  i started by signing up for a yoga class where we would do breathing exercises at the beginning of class

13583 :  was it members of the wellness community

13584 :  now who do you think were the first people that called me

13585 :  put them there

13586 :  now much of the confusion around breathing occurs because we dont really understand the diaphragm

13587 :  so i know what youre thinking

13588 :  however nine out of ten people breathe this way

13589 :  it comes from the military

13590 :  and it happens because of several things

13591 :  im breathing wrong

13592 :  how could this be

13593 :  because im seeing it

13594 :  what was most alarming to me was when i looked around almost everyone i knew

13595 :  its my favorite one

13596 :  we believe that that collective commitment is giving rise to a new kind of employee

13597 :  keep that in mind

13598 :  this movement is already composed of thousands of people with the sharpest minds and the gentlest

13599 :  my search for that took me to eleven different companies in the first year

13600 :  and so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid

13601 :  here take this one instead

13602 :  or if it gets too hot your thermostat registers turn the a

13603 :  and when will we embrace the wisdom of our era

13604 :  i had done all i possibly could and now i was in their

13605 :  i surrendered my body to them

13606 :  but my priority and my focus was always my work

13607 :  whats shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution whats given

13608 :  difference of any kind made no difference to the extraordinary

13609 :  i lived to work

13610 :  i elevated my thighs

13611 :  and i was there to be telling the story

13612 :  i didnt have time to wait around to get a day pass

13613 :  sometimes people invent things because they want to stay alive or feed their children or conquer the

13614 :  it seems preposterous that you would invent the flute a tool that created useless vibrations in air

13615 :  how did that feel when they came and whisked you away and your lifestyle

13616 :  and immediately a lot of different responsibilities in terms of my education and so

13617 :  they were looking the next karmapa and i noticed they were talking to my mom and

13618 :  thats been done

13619 :  have fun changing education

13620 :  whats that law

13621 :  what makes them tick

13622 :  they were having fun and therefore continued

13623 :  we consult groups of kids in our office every week that tell us how they want to learn

13624 :  five years since launched hundred of thousands of kids have accessed to squla

13625 :  seven years ago i was the proud young father of a son gijs aged three and a daughter lara aged

13626 :  because theyre reminders that midnight runs arent permanent solutions they arent intended to be permanent solutions

13627 :  she was having her period

13628 :  but over time because i didnt avoid that sense of shame i learnt from it

13629 :  i think a lot of the people that have talked today have already given great examples of that and i am going to add my

13630 :  hes whispering into your ears

13631 :  it changes the way you frame your own experience it changes the way you think about your perpetrator it means that if

13632 :  lets call him mike

13633 :  we started by talking to college survivors

13634 :  so this to me is a tragic but a solvable problem

13635 :  and so we did

13636 :  but when she sees mike taking girls home from parties shes worried about them

13637 :  i learned to be a coach and a mentor to entrepreneurs

13638 :  i learned to organize events

13639 :  i also learned to speak in public

13640 :  he left and the monks started to ponder the rabbis words

13641 :  put some electronics behind it you got yourself a rain gauge

13642 :  because we commit ourselves to publish all the valid science out there the biggest challenge that we actually

13643 :  does this model work

13644 :  so nine years ago we started frontiers which is an open science platform and today one of the

13645 :  as a neuroscientist i saw these problems first hand

13646 :  we have to be implementing those solutions right now

13647 :  in this context having efficient and open access to the latest science is important

13648 :  together with my husband henry whos also a neuroscientist we decided to do something about this

13649 :  in open science everybody in the world has the right to access the latest research

13650 :  i need to explain what i mean by that

13651 :  and when we do that our neighbors be they next door or in the next or next country

13652 :  that were building our natural defenses putting people to work restoring our natural systems

13653 :  we think local and we act local

13654 :  and reading that book made me reexamine that fear because

13655 :  i started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve

13656 :  and we wanted to create hundreds of jobs

13657 :  so you know you need to help him out

13658 :  has its issues but i will talk about l

13659 :  and im a grown woman now and i have learned a few things along the way

13660 :  how do we need to behave

13661 :  we can move other living things out of the way

13662 :  how we might foster that

13663 :  that is a microcosm of all the things that are going on in the rest of the world

13664 :  thank you all

13665 :  i think we need to just restore that kind of value into all of our lives

13666 :  in other words learns how to get along with each other and becomes interdependent with every other living thing

13667 :  innovations that weve created as human beings come down to the things that we value and

13668 :  as humans our intelligence our social capabilities and our problem solving skills enable us to work

13669 :  and then it occurred to me

13670 :  a good fairy turned him into a real boy

13671 :  two ways two tons

13672 :  its just the way things are

13673 :  nowadays she has a dog and two cats which she loves a lot

13674 :  as children we were taught not to harm animals but that we have to

13675 :  when we arrived at our final destination

13676 :  what we eat especially animal products has a big impact on the environment

13677 :  people often ask me why im a vegan why i became vegan

13678 :  we had homemade potato salad white buns boiled eggs and sausages

13679 :  we used to play when we were kids

13680 :  what am i trying to get at is

13681 :  the airplane was invented by the wright brothers and was an essential component of world war i

13682 :  i for one i am glad that they screen cars nowadays

13683 :  until more research is done we dont have an exact answer

13684 :  so there must be some evolutionary advantage of having dyslexia

13685 :  and while there is large individual variability we see this strong correlation between reading

13686 :  in other words the poorer the performance in reading or more dyslexic you were the higher performance in

13687 :  in our study we looked at

13688 :  i spent all this time seven years to that point doing something that i loved doing something that i

13689 :  i was crying probably cussing at everybody around

13690 :  because the thing you have in your hand is what you can make influence with

13691 :  yes you can be that guy doing that thing making this money but what do you actually

13692 :  i was just mad you know

13693 :  at the age of eleven i was competing at the national championship

13694 :  when promo started for the 5k mamma grace started telling people that the most important thing is to be nice to

13695 :  we got lunch and went to the park

13696 :  later that night my mum told me that i was a really good friend but i dont think i did anything special because

13697 :  her name was cameron gallagher

13698 :  for some it is sharing their story

13699 :  i will always share spending camerons last day with her

13700 :  she died that day

13701 :  she gave me a pin for listening

13702 :  that speaks volumes to my message of compassion

13703 :  i didnt realize how much my life was about to change

13704 :  so this allows children to get for some of them their only meal of the day

13705 :  i have two dogs

13706 :  as well as looking at transmittable diseases which a lot of times we think of as big deals for avian

13707 :  you increase the amount of product that each animal will make so the amount of

13708 :  five billion are involved with live stock

13709 :  so the management of their stock livestock veterinary profession has a huge impact on

13710 :  you think about it

13711 :  so for some people animals are their tractors theyre whats tearing the land

13712 :  army medical service core and this is when i realized what the veterinary profession was doing to make an

13713 :  and what can a cartoonist do

13714 :  this is not how it works

13715 :  witness nn is in the film this story is not

13716 :  im going to tell you a story thats not in the film

13717 :  threw us off a little bit

13718 :  we actually thought wed found that guy for our second documentary

13719 :  whats rapes brand

13720 :  why are you stopping now

13721 :  can i get away with that

13722 :  thats what i am talking about in the future of ads

13723 :  so we are going to see mainstream go niche

13724 :  they love it

13725 :  this category has only been around for couple of years

13726 :  you can see the power of where thats going to go for us

13727 :  so people who now carry a three inch device vs

13728 :  i mean i live in new york city

13729 :  so they treat them like vips

13730 :  they tend to convert higher

13731 :  its technology its content and distribution

13732 :  dont think about it as dedicated to screens

13733 :  its no longer two thousand and seven
13734 :  and don t think about online offline anymore

13735 :  its going to be offsite devices

13736 :  its going to be mobility driven

13737 :  so the next generation i think we are going to move to is the connection generation

13738 :  that was the skin in the game

13739 :  its about all the things we already see in the market today

13740 :  its about mutual funds

13741 :  for many years i was a believer in the placental origins and suffered from something called confirmation bias

13742 :  its that story that id like to explore with you today

13743 :  so pre planning but even at a greater degree

13744 :  they show up in europe somewhere around forty thousand even fortyfive thousand in some spots and they spread out around there

13745 :  basically what it suggests to me i cant give you a definitive answer and say yes absolutely there

13746 :  lets talk about mental time travel

13747 :  because that is the reality is if we go far enough back into our own deep history there

13748 :  so not something thats useful at a very one
13749 :  again coming back to that that doesnt exist anywhere in nature

13750 :  and also what we find with these early toolmakers is that they actually were exhibiting

13751 :  this is not a self representation

13752 :  they still do rock art

13753 :  so obviously homo sapiens at the top

13754 :  theyre making really nice tools surviving quite well making good use of their landscape all of those types of things are in

13755 :  these are actually very unusual things

13756 :  so what does that mean

13757 :  that once you go into a cave we go in with headlamps and lots of light and we know what a cave is geologically

13758 :  now what i mean when i say mental time travel is the ability to think about past and future

13759 :  not just about size but then also about how is it wired how are the neural pathways moving

13760 :  but the question thats come up is

13761 :  and guess what

13762 :  is it possible

13763 :  are we seeing on the walls potentially some of the trance like imagery which they have

13764 :  so if were capable of it why wouldnt they have been

13765 :  but what were not seeing is those kinds of behaviours that make us go

13766 :  why are they depicting this

13767 :  that particular one is about thirtytwo thousand years old

13768 :  and so this is where what ive looked at is can we find those in the caves in europe

13769 :  it affects everything from something as simple as the holidays we celebrate to the names that we give our children

13770 :  huge herds of bison and mammoth and all these other things on the landscape

13771 :  so you probably saw i said the god spot what were talking about there is that

13772 :  its incredibly subjective right

13773 :  and whats so fascinating about the early humans in africa is that for probably about the first

13774 :  so something is definitely going on in that sense

13775 :  maybe it might have been as early as sixty thousand so somewhere in that forty sixty thousand range is when modern humans

13776 :  so whats going on

13777 :  this particular one is the adult male and its about twentyeight thousand years old its from russia

13778 :  and this is kind of the story going forward and this is again where wynn and coolidge have made this

13779 :  so lots of things to eat which was kind of a pull factor that probably kept modern humans there

13780 :  similar to enhanced working memory theres actually several parts of the brain that are all kind of working together

13781 :  so now we get specifically to a research project that ive been working on where i said okay well lets try

13782 :  they live out in the desert and still practice the hunter gatherer lifestyle

13783 :  then on top of that we actually have the fact that the two other burials at that particular site are actually of two

13784 :  what if they were wearing a mask

13785 :  something thats say half animal half human would be an impossible entity

13786 :  but i would have to warn them because at this point my quit rate was also eighty percent

13787 :  it turns out that over eighty percent of the people around dont enjoy their work

13788 :  we have this little group

13789 :  so i wanted to find out what is it that sets these people apart the people who do the passionate world changing work that wake up inspired

13790 :  you know before this a passion could come and hit you in the face or maybe in your possible line of work you might throw it away

13791 :  youre not going to sink

13792 :  either way we start to believe it

13793 :  and one of my friends now he has a family of eight and he supports his whole family

13794 :  it didnt matter what it was

13795 :  this blew my mind

13796 :  and he dives in swims off

13797 :  i dont like my job

13798 :  in one thousand eight hundred and ninetyeight norman triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists and he would measure their times around the

13799 :  what would that look like

13800 :  i wanted to find the work that i couldnt not do what that was for me

13801 :  but once we have this framework together we can start to identify the things that make us come alive

13802 :  i highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that youre naturally good at

13803 :  you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with

13804 :  and those people have made up that community of passionate folks who inspired that possibility that i

13805 :  most things are totally out of our hands

13806 :  and then what happened

13807 :  the people change everything and this is why

13808 :  and that later became what i now call live your legend which ill explain in a little bit

13809 :  either we give up or we never start in the first place

13810 :  to find something that i could screw up

13811 :  they change everything and its a proven fact

13812 :  roger bannister and the four minute mile it was a physical impossibility to break the four minute mile in a foot

13813 :  every invention every new thing in the world people thought were crazy at first

13814 :  if you dont think you can run a mile you show yourself you can run a mile or two or a marathon or lose five pounds or

13815 :  its all about just building your resume

13816 :  i just had no idea he was going to swim

13817 :  and then im over here in san francisco and everyone around me was doing it

13818 :  hes like but really just have fun with this

13819 :  we are the pillars of our families yet some of us still possess no self worth

13820 :  mediocritys feature thats the saddest isnt its fair to middling status

13821 :  so the question becomes

13822 :  you are a teacher and everything in between

13823 :  you are a gift to mankind

13824 :  and sure the conversation may be far from sparkling but at least its safe

13825 :  now one need not be socrates to define this word on my mind

13826 :  leaving this earth today what would be your legacy

13827 :  if all that were given comes from that which we give why do we offer ourselves such a paltry sum

13828 :  you are a martyr you are a queen

13829 :  to those wary of doing too much or too little the middle bowl juts comfortably with lots of company

13830 :  we never give ourselves enough credit and we allow others to put us down

13831 :  you are the rarest treasure of all to find

13832 :  its all about the choice that decides if you lose or gain

13833 :  you are an empowering woman

13834 :  through no rhyme or reason discovered because i felt i had no choice

13835 :  you are an empowering woman sharing the phenomenon that is called love

13836 :  this is what drama is all about

13837 :  and thats what i want to qualify the purpose

13838 :  for example when we see drama we root for the person that really fights all these

13839 :  and the second type of feedback i get is

13840 :  i really appreciated the perspective you gave about staying focused on what you are conversation

13841 :  are you saying that i am a racist

13842 :  why did i do this

13843 :  robert govers and i have spent the best part of the last two years with the help of a large number of very serious and clever people

13844 :  so my colleague dr

13845 :  oh sure were very good at empathy when its a question of dealing with people who kind of look like us and kind of walk and

13846 :  they have enough to deal with in washington as it is

13847 :  we need to identify those organizations that are most effective on the ground and give them boots

13848 :  one in three american children is on track to develop type two diabetes one in two of our children of color

13849 :  we dont want their collections

13850 :  we want to build our own identities our own fabric create an open dialogue so that we share our

13851 :  we dont want to have what there is in the west

13852 :  and therefore tradition becomes more important not less important

13853 :  we should not underestimate it

13854 :  we do have artists but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet

13855 :  were trying to be part of this global village but at the same time were revising ourselves through our

13856 :  and yes qatar wants to be a modern nation

13857 :  and funnily enough they were frustrated about that

13858 :  eighteen people were killed

13859 :  it was anarchy

13860 :  its what i do

13861 :  security council and for the members of the u

13862 :  at that time there was just me and me and my wife were moving back to new york

13863 :  i wanted to be an ambassador and my mentors my heroes people who got to the top of my profession and here i

13864 :  i had been steeped in the intelligence on iraq and its wmd and my testimony to

13865 :  and independent diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way

13866 :  and it was like that for me

13867 :  i went through those mobs

13868 :  i know this stuff

13869 :  and so that was the idea

13870 :  and he goes you know i just cant do this anymore

13871 :  that is the state of the world today

13872 :  in new york when i started independent diplomat

13873 :  these things really interested me

13874 :  we have no choice but to embrace that reality

13875 :  those other things are called non state actors

13876 :  we went around seventy u

13877 :  why dont you advise their government on their diplomacy

13878 :  everybody went yes of course youre absolutely right

13879 :  security council to explain to them what they want

13880 :  however it is already clear that your ancestors survival through mass extinction

13881 :  it merely leveled the playing field

13882 :  by being here listening alive a member of a growing species you are one of

13883 :  the extinction was a filter

13884 :  its important that we know this

13885 :  and we enact those free traits

13886 :  the introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor where they are able

13887 :  they all gather together

13888 :  thats where im going now

13889 :  im a professor

13890 :  and ive seen you

13891 :  let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion because its consequential and its

13892 :  its almost as old as storytelling itself

13893 :  i would tell them about how on the weekends i would go home and i would spy for the queen of england

13894 :  and she was like why

13895 :  i was in charge of the four year olds which is good because four year olds cant play sports and

13896 :  i used to be a summer camp counselor

13897 :  it was going to be the highlight of our store

13898 :  adults can too and we get there when we read

13899 :  i would do it on my summers off from college and i loved it

13900 :  and heres just one example

13901 :  and i said ive got powerpoint

13902 :  thank you very much

13903 :  and remnants of hat honour still exist today so a man going into church or attending a funeral will generally remove his hat

13904 :  however we do still face some unspoken societal customs so the male business suit which is

13905 :  and even the very rich so henry viii for example recycled his clothing and tailored them and changed them as fashions

13906 :  when i fly i feel the wind buffeting my face

13907 :  its for me to try and slowly make up that twentyfive years that i would otherwise

13908 :  it honestly scared me and still does to think that if i were to live for say

13909 :  our little miniature dinosaurs

13910 :  last night i went online and did some research

13911 :  the antibiotic producers thats one weapon

13912 :  i favor humans over ideology but right now the ideologues are winning and theyre

13913 :  and if somebody gets in the way we screen them out

13914 :  its the opposite of democracy

13915 :  somebody worked out exactly which plane she was on so they linked to a flight tracker website

13916 :  you are the worldwide number one trending topic on twitter

13917 :  but it was worse than that

13918 :  and so to her shame she wrote she shut up and watched as justines life got

13919 :  people would admit shameful secrets about themselves and other people would say oh my god im exactly the

13920 :  we were all so excited about destroying justine and our shaming brains are so simple minded that we

13921 :  and so wed buy the date and wed go home

13922 :  very sadly he took his own life

13923 :  so lets talk about those three as

13924 :  weve got books buffets and radio waves wedding brides and rollercoaster rides

13925 :  we talked about the tv show we watched that evening

13926 :  life was pretty good

13927 :  i would imagine that youd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings and appreciating the small wonders that youre starting to

13928 :  we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages

13929 :  weve got fashion magazines house party scenes

13930 :  weve got airplanes highway lanes interior design and horoscope signs

13931 :  i spoke to him on the phone at one thousand and thirty p

13932 :  theres just so many things to be happy about

13933 :  we grew up and we grew older

13934 :  i mean were the only ones with architecture and agriculture

13935 :  but some of them are red hot five stars

13936 :  hippo campus right

13937 :  and as you practice the basal ganglia and the cerebellum make you better

13938 :  david wirtshafter and his wife walking down michigan avenue

13939 :  it is a learning circuit

13940 :  and i had a little bit of trepidation about walking up to him because he had retired early

13941 :  and as a teacher i was using one

13942 :  so i put together this detailed syllabus i had overheads with everything that you could

13943 :  as a teacher how do you do this

13944 :  she told me the same day that hummus is made up of ground up hummingbirds

13945 :  that is fantastic

13946 :  in my class everything is on the board

13947 :  and for decades neuroscientists have been figuring out the anatomy and the physiology of the brain

13948 :  maybe were going to win maybe were not

13949 :  and i said i knew that

13950 :  two or three times a week for many years after that i would go to the late night

13951 :  did i hear a click

13952 :  its true it makes sense but its surprising

13953 :  because of their basal ganglia and their cerebellum

13954 :  well students are veterans of the classroom so i certainly dont help

13955 :  and he goes rose

13956 :  the power of maybe

13957 :  these guys we would go head to head and they would crush us

13958 :  was that the fuel pump that clicked in

13959 :  the power of maybe

13960 :  the terrorists or the media industry vs

13961 :  the institutional are slower but able to use power more effectively

13962 :  is there actually no room for freedom liberty and social change in the technological future

13963 :  so all the syrian dissidents used facebook to organize

13964 :  oversight is the second thing

13965 :  its also critical

13966 :  but when big institutions finally figured it out they had more raw power to magnify and they got even more

13967 :  and in many cases the interests are aligning

13968 :  whether its setting up your own email server or using encryption or breaking copy protection the technologies are

13969 :  is the quick or the strong

13970 :  but weve kind of forgotten it in our fear of terrorism or other modern threats

13971 :  and we need to preserve it

13972 :  and the police who are like trained on agatha christie novels

13973 :  to the extent the powerless have access to it they gain in power to extent the already power have access to it

13974 :  the pirates or china vs

13975 :  and again its a long understood mechanism for checking power

13976 :  on the one side its traditional power think of organized institutional powers like governments and large multi

13977 :  and the key to all this is access to data

13978 :  and its a combination of things

13979 :  its courts that act as third party advocates its legislators that understand technologies its a vibrant

13980 :  theres also a crime rate that society is willing to tolerate

13981 :  but to me the most exciting part of it is the data that were gathering

13982 :  sebastians teaching another class now

13983 :  we preferred open ended questions

13984 :  we have managed to make the name of this thing remarkably complicated

13985 :  but as you may have discovered sometimes we see what we are looking for

13986 :  we call it e

13987 :  and i hear a lot of people out on the west coast who say oh el ni o is coming we are going to get rain

13988 :  i think saturday night live may had something to do with that

13989 :  in life we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to and i think metaphorically speaking at least we could all

13990 :  part of me felt quite proud of myself but mostly i was just utterly terrified

13991 :  minus fifty was the coldest

13992 :  i remember sitting there looking down at my sledge

13993 :  no one had ever done this

13994 :  scotts team were on foot all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges and they arrived at the pole to find the

13995 :  mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain and i wonder

13996 :  i was twentysix at the time

13997 :  this avoids time spent training thats not productive

13998 :  we are safe because we design safety tests for our parts before we even build them

13999 :  we take this from the test driven development in the software world

14000 :  if everyone in this room spent even just two hours a week rapidly solving problems for social

14001 :  so whats wikispeed doing next

14002 :  this lets us make changes and develop quickly

14003 :  we tied for 10th in the mainstream class

14004 :  these again increase our velocity and we found that morale is a multiplier for velocity

14005 :  how is that possible when existing cars seem to change so slowly

14006 :  and if you are a process coach or a scrum master

14007 :  that meant that we outlasted more than one hundred other cars from companies and universities

14008 :  so what to do

14009 :  we are more than one hundred volunteers in eight countries now

14010 :  i am joe justice

14011 :  youll sharpen your agile skills and make a difference in the world around you

14012 :  many of the members of team wikispeed spent between two and eight hour a week helping us rapidly develop our

14013 :  if you own a business identify a member of your board of directors to be a process coach for the

14014 :  a life based on experiences instead of things

14015 :  they tell us that for each application we need a different product

14016 :  they keep the other eighty for the what if

14017 :  i had about ten wooden spoons until i realized that i only have two hands

14018 :  and i d love to show you three examples of how i actually try to make this happen in

14019 :  for me that involved letting go of a lot of the constructs i had in my head about what impact was and where i would

14020 :  one billion people out of poverty

14021 :  i had to start doing something that was creating a more positive life for my son and for

14022 :  of people watching what is going on stage

14023 :  as you know those of you who know latvia ogre is nowhere near the

14024 :  then i switched to a completely unrelated field

14025 :  speaking in the mouth the drummer emulates the sounds of the drum as a stream of syllables and

14026 :  the great emissary of west african drumming to north america babatunde olatunji

14027 :  both modes of expression are intimately connected

14028 :  i think were hardwired for it

14029 :  now a trained drummer can just as easily speak the rhythm with their mouth as they can with their hands on the drum

14030 :  and a way to think of this is to imagine yourself floating down a river with your friends sharing the same

14031 :  but she was also a maverick in her use of technology in the classroom

14032 :  she had terminal breast cancer

14033 :  its a real thing i dont know if you heard it

14034 :  think about it

14035 :  a really good example of this that you see a lot in that data is the hashtag for directioners

14036 :  its the former boy band one direction

14037 :  that we have far more in common than the things that divide us

14038 :  you might remember this

14039 :  first it multiplies the story itself

14040 :  maybe youve done it as well

14041 :  are you inflating a bubble or are you building a bridge

14042 :  you might be very familiar with that effect

14043 :  they were telling really funny stories

14044 :  it might be a shared belief it might even be a shared experience

14045 :  it can help us to build bridges

14046 :  and where did the money come from usually

14047 :  they want to know about our success stories they want to know about our culture they want to know about our

14048 :  right now today there are over seventy different languages spoken in

14049 :  its important when you travel to another country to know about the customs the cultures and the protocols

14050 :  thats only true most of the time

14051 :  ive also been lucky enough to be involved in trade missions that have taken me to countries virtually all over the world

14052 :  were now living in a multicultural society the likes of which this nation has never seen before

14053 :  when everyone thinks that whatever is happening is just happening naturally

14054 :  but just as our leaders are going to other countries other countries have people here

14055 :  many nations have a protocol for exchanging business cards

14056 :  she lowered it when nine eleven happened

14057 :  it was in the early 1990s

14058 :  for the first time in nearly half a century the people of england began to feel a disconnect with

14059 :  as ive said keep calm and carry on

14060 :  it can make everything flow

14061 :  because the times demanded that that they needed to change

14062 :  in other words it was time to take a look at their protocols because the protocols that had been in place

14063 :  she lowered it when the queen mother died

14064 :  at some point he just said forty million people are going to see you today

14065 :  the day after when really it became a lot of talking i said to myself and my wife said to me

14066 :  we can remember facts we can remember abstract concept even whole topics with

14067 :  so we have to start getting used to thinking in pictures

14068 :  a thoughtful expression

14069 :  it doesn t have to be that way

14070 :  different people of course find different meanings

14071 :  whoever has a strong why will be able to endure almost any how

14072 :  the fact that you my customer my employee my spouse my friend the fact that you don t have reasons to

14073 :  there s a lot of talk about loyalty these days

14074 :  anyone who has been to one of my courses will tell you that i love telling people about ted and i use it in my

14075 :  these trees will never grow any further and they will almost give no fruit

14076 :  actually eighteen of them leave because of price

14077 :  suddenly he remembers that he has someone to his right

14078 :  this is innovation over the edge

14079 :  we have really severe energy problems in africa

14080 :  the gold of today is mobile and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible

14081 :  because we have real problems

14082 :  now this is real innovation not the way people have expropriated the word to talk about launching

14083 :  and if you can do that you can rise out of poverty

14084 :  so what are some of the things that you can do with it

14085 :  because we have to

14086 :  in one thousand nine hundred and sixtythree a storm ripped up the harbor in a small south african town called

14087 :  so of course people like to go to local shops but youd be prepared to go a little bit further if it was a

14088 :  oscar wilde once said an economist knows the price of everything but the value of

14089 :  thats all the fresh water on the earth

14090 :  thats bad enough

14091 :  average depth is about two miles

14092 :  and that person has to have an army

14093 :  we know that everything happened the 24th twenty fourth of august in seventynine a

14094 :  it was a friend that betrayed them

14095 :  and that would probably tell you that the date of the eruption was around the end

14096 :  so this is what happened exactly in pompeii

14097 :  what happened then

14098 :  and then so people just imagine started to see those rocks coming down smoking rocks

14099 :  i told you there was a letter

14100 :  so many people especially aristocracy had gone away

14101 :  it vanished in time

14102 :  to open crack open in that morning

14103 :  he was staying at thirty kilometers away

14104 :  its exactly where the big volcano is sitting today

14105 :  and they saw something weird

14106 :  and another thing is that you had like a fog coming down

14107 :  but when you find yourself in front of one of those bodies inside the glass

14108 :  from that day it started to grow and become what we see today

14109 :  so people were in the houses screaming asking for help

14110 :  running water was not there because probably the aqueduct was broken in some places maybe due

14111 :  so i asked myself why didnt the people go away

14112 :  it was just like a tv set of that time

14113 :  so you had the roof starting to collapse

14114 :  it floats in the water

14115 :  not a single one

14116 :  but how do we know that

14117 :  he was a witness

14118 :  probably you also had earthquakes in that process

14119 :  so where could you go

14120 :  it doesnt really kill you

14121 :  so no one knew it was a volcano

14122 :  you couldnt see the roads just like when you have a heavy snow

14123 :  if it was the 24th of october it was a friday

14124 :  you couldnt see anything

14125 :  what is a lapilli

14126 :  and these ashes were containing pieces of glass actually that were actually

14127 :  but they were not the killers

14128 :  there was a small mound with a crest

14129 :  and then they would cover and seal everything

14130 :  and we i guess should pay respect to them every time

14131 :  these are not petrified people

14132 :  and then there is another one the last one that is so powerful it goes all the way

14133 :  the first one stops right at the suburbia of pompeii

14134 :  it would reach more than thirtytwo kilometers of height in the hour which is three times

14135 :  but how do we know that

14136 :  but of course they would make mistakes

14137 :  today its a towering volcano

14138 :  so they want to go away but you have so many lapilli its impossible to open the door

14139 :  so that of course is no definite proof but thats interesting to see that such a known

14140 :  probably you dont have the rain of lapilli anymore

14141 :  weve seen so many movies read so many novels telling us about the big volcano telling

14142 :  so that means that probably it was a very cold climate which makes more

14143 :  so is the date right or not

14144 :  they all died without defending themselves

14145 :  we dont know exactly

14146 :  another one says nine days before the calends of november which is the 24th of

14147 :  and thats exactly what the archaeologists found

14148 :  but we know that because pliny the younger wrote that in a letter

14149 :  its just like a piece of cork

14150 :  lets go back to pompeii

14151 :  you couldnt see anything

14152 :  and lets try to answer the question would i have survived

14153 :  so maybe people would go there

14154 :  you didnt have running water

14155 :  in this field of awareness

14156 :  not the way that i was raised

14157 :  then all of a sudden a hunter might say

14158 :  i can tell you generally if its male or female i can tell you what size it is

14159 :  i can tell how its going to fight on the way up or not

14160 :  i was always affirmed

14161 :  when i was a child one
14162 :  theyre not thinking about the past theyre not thinking about the future

14163 :  its a pretty amazing way

14164 :  i could feel the sea lion coming before it came

14165 :  i was never ignored

14166 :  and im saying in my child mind

14167 :  you know its very interesting being up here

14168 :  im going to be like the birds

14169 :  so we wanted to know here what happens when people have mind wandering

14170 :  the brain is a highly efficient energy demanding organ that gets fully utilized

14171 :  and under stress its even worse we mind wander more powerfully and more often

14172 :  and to do this we had to basically come up with an

14173 :  what about now

14174 :  and i want to just bring it back to captain jeff davis

14175 :  where is your attention right now

14176 :  we call it the n170 component and we use this component in many of our studies

14177 :  his mind was worried and preoccupied and had stressful memories and really dread for his

14178 :  to us this was very compelling

14179 :  pretty soon we could tell they were successfully mind wandering because theyd press the button when that face was upside down even though its

14180 :  in which we could have people generate their own mind wandering

14181 :  what about in our actual day to day life

14182 :  what about in the real world

14183 :  but before i tell you about what mindfulness training is or the results of that study i think its important to

14184 :  we make errors

14185 :  and things like stress and mind wandering diminish its power

14186 :  to bring it back id like to make a prediction about your attention for the remainder of my talk

14187 :  in some sense its your brains boss

14188 :  is there anything we can possibly do about this

14189 :  so one question we might ask is why do we do this why do we mind wander so much

14190 :  you up for it

14191 :  he was promoted to major

14192 :  or a surgeon or firefighter missing any time

14193 :  often it happens without our awareness

14194 :  but thats all in the context of these very controlled laboratory settings

14195 :  and perhaps even more impressive is that if people take our training programs over lets say eight weeks and they

14196 :  they were discerning

14197 :  i promised my boss that the work i didnt get done during the day id make up at night from home

14198 :  we used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks

14199 :  i struggled for months being away from my son

14200 :  well look at a lot of them

14201 :  on a national level our paid work is not optional

14202 :  i cried in the bathroom while i washed out the pump equipment

14203 :  for months all i remember is the screaming

14204 :  we have to stop framing this as a mothers issue or even a womens issue

14205 :  in america today we are at one
14206 :  ok this is pop quiz time

14207 :  i say we dont not until theyre of working and tax paying and military serving age

14208 :  theres nothing to see here

14209 :  childbirth is and always will be an enormous psychological event

14210 :  when i read that i was blown away by those numbers

14211 :  i went down there in the winter time

14212 :  and it received quite a bit of attention

14213 :  they hadnt found the sauce yet

14214 :  we need an exercise

14215 :  every time i sort of pushed one down another one would pop back up again

14216 :  you dont have to burn any incense and you definitely dont have to sit on the floor

14217 :  some people hit the bottle start taking medication

14218 :  everythings going fine and we see the anxious thought

14219 :  you go back to it repeat it

14220 :  we miss out on the things that are most important to us and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes

14221 :  the pace of life is often frantic our minds are always busy and were always doing something

14222 :  and the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about ten minutes a day it impacts our

14223 :  well obviously it changed things

14224 :  lets say this is an anxious thought

14225 :  im going to drop them

14226 :  the result of course is that we get stressed

14227 :  and its only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and

14228 :  thats essentially what meditation is

14229 :  in fact we spend more time looking after our cars our clothes and our hair than we okay maybe not our

14230 :  and we reinforce the storyline right

14231 :  wow theres so much anxiety

14232 :  you might find a mind thats very dull and boring and its just almost mechanical it just seems its

14233 :  equally if i relax too much talking to you theres no way i can focus on the balls

14234 :  now our fast acting results were pretty interesting but we still had one lingering question can our sticky

14235 :  but the frontal cortex is not really qualitatively different

14236 :  well new research just came out thirteen seconds ago that shows a whole new approach to that and a new way to take glutathione

14237 :  and jennings and the other guy didnt get that

14238 :  we can see your thoughts create your brain which is really key to how it works

14239 :  ill be able to access that in the cloud

14240 :  that may work it may not but if it does it will remember that and have a new behavior and that can actually spread virally

14241 :  youre probably in the frontal cortex and youll have modules that say that was ironic

14242 :  we can see your brain create your thoughts

14243 :  no other species has done that

14244 :  the flock of birds i mentioned before is beautiful in so many ways

14245 :  what makes this ever so beautiful shape that our eyes are naturally drawn to

14246 :  but what does make them so different

14247 :  its not just repulsion

14248 :  because of this we are privileged

14249 :  as i speak the biotech company bioviva is conducting the first human

14250 :  dinosaur clones would be able to withstand this change in oxygen content without suffering oxygen

14251 :  it was only in one thousand nine hundred and fiftytwo when the hershey chase experiment confirmed that dna was a molecule that

14252 :  you cant be saying that about me

14253 :  its about spirituality culture values

14254 :  we ended up with the reserves

14255 :  we ended up with the residential schools

14256 :  im not a youth

14257 :  we wanted land

14258 :  who was not considered an indian

14259 :  six trillion dollars in size

14260 :  today when we watch this film were not scared

14261 :  transmedia is a whole new set of options that we have at our disposal to tell our

14262 :  this is the time to swim with real humility

14263 :  many many people have died on mt

14264 :  thats not the worst part of it

14265 :  its very very difficult to breath

14266 :  and i dont where i got it from but i was able to somehow pull myself up and as

14267 :  the water is minus one
14268 :  you get altitude sickness

14269 :  so its right up in the heavens

14270 :  ted sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show which also meant by the way that they

14271 :  thats the tv production company of amazon

14272 :  and thats not because a company like multi health systems doesnt know what to do with data

14273 :  so you see roy price is a senior executive with amazon studios

14274 :  and all of that goes back to a decision that roy had to make about three years ago

14275 :  theres another tool that can do that and we all have it and that tool is the brain

14276 :  even the most data savvy companies get it wrong

14277 :  they record when somebody presses play when somebody presses pause what parts they skip what parts they watch again

14278 :  they used data all the way to drive their decision making first when they held their competition of tv ideas then

14279 :  they are being watched by roy price and his team who record everything

14280 :  and that brought me back again to my childhood

14281 :  and that made me realized wait a minute

14282 :  today for better or worse

14283 :  and i think we all sense that something big is happening

14284 :  but whats striking is the commonalities the structural features of these new models and how they

14285 :  and in fact that model means that the challenge for new power is how do you use

14286 :  because theyre not an exercise of top down perfectionism they are about the network

14287 :  so whats the moral of this story

14288 :  and this reflects the extraordinary strength of the emerging indian middle class and the

14289 :  and remember that in the 20th century this was not at all true

14290 :  more participation more peer coordination sometimes distorts outcomes and there are some things like things for example

14291 :  so lets say youve used a peer to peer lending platform like lending tree or prosper then youve figured out that

14292 :  once you have an experience of new power you tend to expect and want more of it

14293 :  ill give you one example of a fax campaign that i ran

14294 :  new power values participation and new power is all about do it yourself

14295 :  so will new power elites just become old power and squeeze

14296 :  i see people nodding

14297 :  or will that new power base bite back

14298 :  and to me thats absolutely worth trying for

14299 :  so weve spent a bit of time thinking how can we plot organizations on a two by

14300 :  and thats going to pose an enormous problem

14301 :  about ninetynine of you would say

14302 :  its actually not my idea

14303 :  two more had applied for housing

14304 :  the basic income may not be implemented in the next three or four years but it may be implemented in the next

14305 :  ideas can and do change the world

14306 :  and what did they spend it on

14307 :  what do you think is good for you

14308 :  and after ten or maybe twenty years it wll turn out that the investment has paid for itself

14309 :  because our forefathers worked so hard to achieve our current level of prosperity we can now afford to give

14310 :  it was this man who almost implemented a modest basic income at the beginning of the 70s in the united

14311 :  well this is a great idea

14312 :  what happened in the first place was that the men turned out to be extremely frugal with the money they received

14313 :  of course not

14314 :  in fact history is ruled by little else

14315 :  no ones going to tell you what you have to do with it no ones going to tell you what you have to do for it

14316 :  i think about ninetynine of you would say

14317 :  so what are microalgae

14318 :  and then flunk them to the side somewhere

14319 :  not to be slipped into now and again

14320 :  to exercise the love of social complexity and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their

14321 :  thank you frans de waal wherever you are i love you and id give anything to meet you

14322 :  in the research phase of the project at interval we partnered with a company called

14323 :  so david and i decided to go find out through the best research we could muster what it would

14324 :  who are my friends

14325 :  after we had done that with a pretty large team of people and discovered what we thought the salient issues were

14326 :  we spent two and a half years conducting research we spent another year and a half in advance development

14327 :  the other title that we launched is called secret paths in the forest which addresses the more fantasy oriented inner lives of

14328 :  and interval research is kind of the living example of how that can be true

14329 :  its not just large companies digging into your life its free apps and small startups as well

14330 :  it only means that they need your permission

14331 :  i realised on my phone that every time i logged fitness data into the app endomondo it was sharing my

14332 :  for example i stopped signing up to supposedly free services for example a vip card at my

14333 :  personal data is considered anything that can be traced directly back to you

14334 :  i dont own any furniture and i dont have any children

14335 :  personalised browser ads may be harmless but connecting disparate aspects of your life to

14336 :  in two thousand and fifteen samsung was found to be recording people in the homes in which their tvs had been

14337 :  i turned off targeted advertising and i asked facebook to send me all the information that they held on me

14338 :  i made up a fake email address and i started registering with a fake age and gender

14339 :  i like the idea of living abroad someday

14340 :  companies are also starting to predict future behaviours for example whether youre a trustworthy driver a good

14341 :  this means it will become too expensive for companies governments and non profits to recklessly

14342 :  i have given up my right to self determination and free choice

14343 :  i immediately wrote to my local council and asked them to make my voter records private

14344 :  a school where too many people had given up on

14345 :  the violence and the apathy towards education too

14346 :  the positivity is infectious and superstars well theyre made up of ordinary people

14347 :  and our boys well they wear their uniform with great pride

14348 :  we were there for them when they fell

14349 :  we tried to catch them doing the right thing and acknowledge them for that

14350 :  eight years on and our school is almost unrecognizable

14351 :  my father never had the chance to finish his schooling and yet he remains as one of the greatest teachers that ive ever

14352 :  they want to be at this school

14353 :  that a family is there for you

14354 :  once thriving it had lost its way

14355 :  where members of staff suffered post traumatic stress as a result of a constant violence and dysfunction

14356 :  last year sixtyfive of our boys went on to further education

14357 :  i heard all sorts of stories before i started there

14358 :  and do you know what

14359 :  compare that to just thirty eight years ago

14360 :  where regardless of where a school sits on some simplistic ranking system

14361 :  so did all this tinkering and reviewing and engaging and all that sort of stuff actually make a difference academically

14362 :  and yep you guessed it

14363 :  he had my back

14364 :  youre wasting your time

14365 :  that comes out to about seven days total over the course of your entire lifetime

14366 :  when i walk by a failing school i see a body count

14367 :  the average person sees a doctor for just about two hours per year

14368 :  he has so many potential answers

14369 :  hes processing so many different possible variations

14370 :  not even the classroom we can worry about the classroom later

14371 :  he just looked at me dad you just dont get it

14372 :  my classroom was one of the first pilot for the friends for life program

14373 :  when hes asked why cant you just give a response why cant you just

14374 :  it wont be easy but get them in the school

14375 :  here are my rules when working with generalized anxiety and any sort of mental illness

14376 :  like a dozen

14377 :  what can it be

14378 :  is this a time to fight flight or flee

14379 :  we have to take it for what it is

14380 :  its not enough that many people i know and many of us in this room probably had this opportunity

14381 :  well they could go further

14382 :  take for example steve jobs

14383 :  looking back now i see theres a clear message to this song

14384 :  well they were right

14385 :  there are real concerns there

14386 :  no we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time

14387 :  that would be very boring

14388 :  this lights the brain up

14389 :  im going to give up

14390 :  we also say theres going to be loads of other items of varying qualities and levels of excitement

14391 :  we can use calculated randomness

14392 :  and so these combine to form a very intense emotional engagement

14393 :  but there was a problem

14394 :  so what i did was again like i did with the dodo skull i blew all my reference up to full size and then i began

14395 :  but again i am not a sculptor and so i dont know a lot of the tricks like i dont know how my friend mike gets

14396 :  i really dont know

14397 :  i know mom certainly did

14398 :  pete beach florida and when i arrived i found about three apartments worth of stuff crammed in a

14399 :  we had no money at all

14400 :  why did you leave all these behind

14401 :  today id like to share with you my birmingham story

14402 :  you can think about renaissance florence you can think about paris in the years just before and after world war

14403 :  but we know from numerous sociological and psychological studies that iq itself is in fact highly

14404 :  each group saw the other as an attack on them as something that made them question whether they

14405 :  it would just be impossible to get the data

14406 :  and this is just what makes dreams so interesting so exciting when an individual harnesses

14407 :  each dream is a saunter through an endless sandbox our own wild west with nothing holding us back

14408 :  to me dreams are the worlds most immersive and fantastic movies with private showings every night

14409 :  dreams let us escape the restrictions of our physical world

14410 :  throughout these and the many other journeys that await this afternoon we invite you to consider your own dreams as

14411 :  i went to where one of the oldest dogs in the world was eating

14412 :  i knew i needed to do everything i could in my power to figure out how and why this

14413 :  so i settled on a worldwide journey traveling around the world looking for answers

14414 :  he said some days the dog wouldnt eat

14415 :  thomas said you know what

14416 :  so whats in that ninety
14417 :  i even come up with an equation for this just to tell how awesome they are

14418 :  for me it seemed pretty evident where i was going to go

14419 :  and today im going to share with you my journey

14420 :  so i got in contact with thomas

14421 :  so when it came to her diet please share with me

14422 :  if we want to dig deeper into that ninety lets remove the ten for a second you cant change your dogs genes if you went and adopted your

14423 :  and he laughed at me

14424 :  whats even more important is that we see a lower incidence of cancer in these animals

14425 :  that was until he got a puppy

14426 :  some people may say i dont know that was very confusing i wouldnt be able to do all that

14427 :  she was self fasting

14428 :  and they want to give them a second chance

14429 :  he told me that there were a couple of factors here when he was feeding maggie

14430 :  what was your most memorable experience you and your daughter shared in this program

14431 :  seven million minor children who have an incarcerated parent

14432 :  life skills such as communication responsibility critical thinking skills problem solving

14433 :  an image of the one
14434 :  my inner child who hungered for the embrace of my parents lost to the system had begun to

14435 :  i have a son

14436 :  we have sons in here

14437 :  because as a young boy i was taught that boys are supposed to be strong and brave

14438 :  we must remember that no one is mandated to give our children any type of an

14439 :  will they be gainfully employed

14440 :  lets design to make it beautiful as advanced potty training

14441 :  we think the problem is solved here in the us

14442 :  the other half goes right out the other side

14443 :  but the10 you know the ten people are freaked out

14444 :  but roughly a thousand times as many people who

14445 :  so lets talk about making simulator realities by humans

14446 :  so can we take a real brain and make it into a virtual mind

14447 :  the second is

14448 :  so without the controversy thats cool thing number one

14449 :  we induce cells okay say skin cells by adding a few genes to them culturing them and then

14450 :  and smith says how would you respond

14451 :  and the thing is these judgments tend to be accurate

14452 :  were very good at this sort of thing

14453 :  and to explore this he did a series of classic studies with british adolescents

14454 :  and my favorite example of this is a question that came from the audience in a republican debate prior to the last

14455 :  and that could well have been a catalyst for great social change

14456 :  and there are different avenues

14457 :  but he had a long lasting interest in the science of prejudice and so when a prestigious british scholarship

14458 :  we openly acknowledge it

14459 :  when animals are going to make a point they make the point

14460 :  its a letter

14461 :  now im going to give you a four paragraph format to work with

14462 :  and the answer is rather strange

14463 :  now think about it

14464 :  we need to kill things we need to eradicate the stuff thats too complex that gets in our ways meetings and emails so we can make

14465 :  and they can do it for really long time before they can finally get to whats right about it

14466 :  are we empowering people

14467 :  i think what we have to do is we have to approach change in a brand new way

14468 :  how can we ask a better question

14469 :  were very uncomfortable with the soft behavioral things

14470 :  i think its great to question things

14471 :  must be there for a reason

14472 :  and he put a banana on top of the cage

14473 :  the day to day stuff you do

14474 :  and thats how change and innovation will really happen

14475 :  get to the answer

14476 :  suddenly he got really engaged

14477 :  this is by our dear friend mark stewart

14478 :  so meatless mondays actually started as an accident

14479 :  so im going to deconstruct those two words and hopefully draw some insights that can be

14480 :  so first the history

14481 :  so its really easy

14482 :  and i think by doing that you can just draw inspiration and feel part of a larger movement that

14483 :  i was at grey advertising for twenty years

14484 :  and so the interesting thing about the week is that its not based on any planetary or

14485 :  and that pattern is the week

14486 :  it had really become a true movement

14487 :  and so we went to the innovators and the leaders in each of the categories of types of

14488 :  and just last week we got a request from someone in zimbabwe who wanted to start a

14489 :  so we also have some really exciting new research that looks at big data analysis of

14490 :  because people are together at school and work at home they can join

14491 :  thats my background

14492 :  and i think sometimes by synchronizing even simple actions we can synchronize our

14493 :  its already there

14494 :  but by improving parenting and caregiver support it may be possible to weaken the links

14495 :  hala simply could no longer cope

14496 :  despite all these challenges they faced they were trying to help their children

14497 :  to have that in manchester would be a huge achievement let alone in a conflict zone in syria

14498 :  but its often those that are the most vulnerable that were trying to support that we actually dont ask

14499 :  or kids ask their parents to come down

14500 :  we couldnt know one hundred
14501 :  how are you maintaining this

14502 :  you have to call a bee keeper

14503 :  and i believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we

14504 :  no powerpoint is used in two days

14505 :  but instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move

14506 :  and if you closed your eyes youd be able to mentally navigate it

14507 :  do we cut males more slack because boys will be boys and we kind of expect them to get into a little

14508 :  so its easy to see why landlords who make a business of providing release housing options

14509 :  women are more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system due to poor coping strategies dealing

14510 :  but when women fight its almost always about relationships and partners and jealousy

14511 :  now most encounters with male offenders are pretty straightforward

14512 :  the reason we feel good is because our mind creates a future memory of what were doing

14513 :  ive been reading all these books about innovation

14514 :  intellectually there is probably no reason to buy a lottery ticket

14515 :  in some ways they are superior pieces of technology

14516 :  but steve jobs found a way of embedding love and emotion into each of the products

14517 :  its the exact opposite of what happened in the plantation model where as we consumed resources we take it down to

14518 :  in fact its a circuit that goes through our emotional centers

14519 :  we actually feel good

14520 :  but in the moment we buy that lottery ticket something happens

14521 :  we use them

14522 :  people love their motorola phones

14523 :  as human beings we are emotional beings

14524 :  when they go to apply them they tend not to work and they cant figure out why

14525 :  but its not a linear path

14526 :  put up your hands

14527 :  embryonic pluripotent stem cells are the type of stem cell that people most often

14528 :  how are we going to do the same thing in the universe where distances are measured in billions

14529 :  i can head any direction

14530 :  so the lesson is that spaces can have the same geometry the same curvature but different topologies

14531 :  apparently were learning that there are surfaces of different curvature

14532 :  and the sum of the angles of that triangle will be one hundred and eighty degrees

14533 :  einsteins field equations which he announced a hundred years ago in one thousand nine hundred and fifteen tell us how

14534 :  and gr is a theory about space and time

14535 :  as it left the less dense places it had to climb less and it lost less energy

14536 :  so the sum of the angles of the triangle on this sphere is more than one hundred and eighty
14537 :  and when the universe was about four hundred thousand years old it was only about half the temperature of the

14538 :  but if you want to you can put this flat map on any screen of any device and it wont get

14539 :  and at that point that plasma became a transparent gas

14540 :  and thats not it for me

14541 :  come at night

14542 :  raise your hand if youre with me

14543 :  that nothing would ever be the same after that moment

14544 :  but what do you want

14545 :  who eats that

14546 :  people have done it with pain so we can tell how much pain people are in at the time of the scan

14547 :  fortunately we have moores law on our side so moores law says that computing power doubles roughly every two years

14548 :  this is very exciting because what you are doing here is using an external piece of technology an mri scanner

14549 :  so that was very cool

14550 :  ibm have simulated a five hundred and thirty billion neuron network with ten trillion synapses

14551 :  actually what they did next was much cooler

14552 :  thc is more often associated with negative effects of cannabis anxiety paranoia

14553 :  but you have to compare that to the cost of making moores law

14554 :  that wont work

14555 :  so this one is the real one

14556 :  now you say thats not much use but its actually pretty close considering we can get about ten thousand times more than we

14557 :  those neutrons hit the wall of the machine

14558 :  now thats not quite good enough because the laser to put that energy in was more energy than that but it

14559 :  when we dont understand something we tend to be afraid of it and if we keep ourselves from it that

14560 :  but i decided i had to do something

14561 :  why the hell would i want to do that

14562 :  and then i became terrified to learn that theyd actually be putting me back at my old high school

14563 :  this is pretty amazing

14564 :  and this giant information system can be searched in many ways

14565 :  no its not possible

14566 :  that will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of venice

14567 :  you have every boat that goes out every boat that comes in every change that was made in the city

14568 :  maybe we can just say

14569 :  it was amazing

14570 :  what they hadnt counted on was digitization because that meant that all those paper receipts had been

14571 :  take it on faith

14572 :  its this democratization of information that i think is an information enlightenment and it has many of the same

14573 :  i thought it always sticks together

14574 :  that was not my intention

14575 :  its really difficult

14576 :  thats why were starting to see more disclosure laws come out so for example on the environment theres the aarhus convention

14577 :  they dont have special powers

14578 :  they all bitched about each other

14579 :  and ive got to tell you i wasnt that hopeful because id seen the establishment

14580 :  i want to see the evidence behind why thats so

14581 :  i mean it was amazing

14582 :  he wasnt content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal

14583 :  and so she set about to make it so

14584 :  youve got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance

14585 :  skepticism because you must always be challenging

14586 :  he threw it all out there

14587 :  that did end up with vulnerable people in afghanistan being exposed

14588 :  we have an official secrets act with no public interest test

14589 :  do you know the one i mean

14590 :  i mean there definitely is progress on the line but i think what we find is that the closer that we get right

14591 :  so a training partner a teacher will push on me to see how stable i am on my feet

14592 :  moving up the trail we find vestibular activity in the brains memory center the

14593 :  the training uses simple focusing techniques to accomplish this

14594 :  i loved my work

14595 :  i want you to think about how you could change that

14596 :  thats what i want to talk with you about

14597 :  scientists call this deidentification

14598 :  but there are other forces at work too

14599 :  a primal appreciation for the bond we shared

14600 :  so when you leave here today im going to ask you to engage or re engage

14601 :  i think of us as the flyover states

14602 :  most middle borns dont get quite as sweet a deal

14603 :  and he would react to being disturbed on a saturday morning by stalking into the playroom and

14604 :  thats not fighting thats performance art

14605 :  i love this idea of engagement

14606 :  and its pretty expensive actually

14607 :  so thats all ive got for you today

14608 :  it was the very definition of absurd to me at that moment

14609 :  and the purpose of this is that youre supposed to air out all of this bad stuff thats been bottled up inside of you and then

14610 :  in fact it was the most important part of the book

14611 :  itll give me something to do when im bored right

14612 :  there will be shouting

14613 :  so lets look at the first choice that you come across in the first film

14614 :  okay now lifesaver is an idea

14615 :  they dont forget completely

14616 :  and so of course they cant help

14617 :  everything from drowning to car crash

14618 :  and we throw you right in at the deep end

14619 :  we went to tiny charities like the resuscitation council uk

14620 :  there will be screaming

14621 :  but they forget to the extent that if a crisis really happens they dont actually

14622 :  if theres a crisis they just have no idea what to do

14623 :  it will not be at all nice or polite

14624 :  it was that close

14625 :  and so it becomes much more emotionally involving

14626 :  there will be blood

14627 :  and so they dont do anything

14628 :  and we went to everyone we could think of

14629 :  we naturally want to do lifesaver for germany for the united states for china

14630 :  if you lose then the victim dies you go back a bit you try again

14631 :  and so the whole thing just collapses horribly

14632 :  much more gripping

14633 :  there will be panic

14634 :  we also want to do twelve most common emergencies

14635 :  we want to do one about womens personal safety

14636 :  but not only did mr

14637 :  come on a journey with me

14638 :  my inner stripper was very strong

14639 :  i grew up watching whoopi goldberg roseanne barr ellen and all of these women had one thing in

14640 :  however if i grew up with social media i dont think i would be

14641 :  you cant catch it

14642 :  hollywood has a sordid history of casting able bodied actors to play disabled

14643 :  my big break came in two thousand and ten
14644 :  the doctors said that i wouldnt walk but i am here in front of you

14645 :  what does she suffer from

14646 :  and i knew that i would be promoted from diner diner to wacky best friend

14647 :  suddenly my disability on the world wide web is fair game

14648 :  i hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media

14649 :  so i became a comic

14650 :  yo is she retarded

14651 :  i couldnt rebound

14652 :  i lost balls all the time

14653 :  she was afraid something is going to happen to him

14654 :  we were more flexible

14655 :  even though he was from serbia he was a muslim

14656 :  i felt unwanted

14657 :  so that was really something exciting

14658 :  we have now held peace mask project workshops in various countries around the world including

14659 :  we witnessed kilometer after kilometer of towns and villages flattened along the

14660 :  tell me what are they waiting for

14661 :  the food industry is on all of these platforms

14662 :  theyre saying well were marketing to kids less were doing it less

14663 :  probably all of us know where young people are these days

14664 :  com which is mcdonalds site just for preschoolers

14665 :  im seeing proof of that everywhere i go

14666 :  so you might think well ok so the answers simple

14667 :  theres lots of other things theyre doing

14668 :  youtube facebook twitter

14669 :  seventythree of teenagers are now on some social media site

14670 :  im here to tell you about the state of maine that was the first to pass a

14671 :  im not just here to tell you how upset as a parent i am

14672 :  if a child watches a typical amount of television every year they will now be seeing

14673 :  there are now dozens of websites out there designed for kids by food companies with free

14674 :  thats what they say

14675 :  it was the kind of obsession that had her faking injuries just so she could wear them

14676 :  there are sites like ronald

14677 :  i mean if you look at it from the outside i had a great life

14678 :  im not an addict

14679 :  what if its a worse relapse than the last one

14680 :  developing aud was an incredibly confusing thing for somebody who admittedly likes to be in

14681 :  went cold turkey and tried to detox

14682 :  day five i was in a full blown binge i was drinking anything and everything i

14683 :  if we addicts had a normal disease we would be treated with sympathy and comfort instead were

14684 :  keith humphreys from stanford university said its remarkable that people believe whats needed is more

14685 :  i was a very light drinker in my 20s

14686 :  i also asked him to thank american researcher dr

14687 :  think about it

14688 :  he said well why dont you write a book

14689 :  tt and we have the we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how

14690 :  we are big people and were trying to deal with whats happening in our society

14691 :  im on a point

14692 :  we will continue to work within jcc

14693 :  thats for little children

14694 :  they went right in here

14695 :  i read a lot of spy novels and stuff

14696 :  that is about three and a half billion u

14697 :  what are the figures hes relying on

14698 :  i was a young man at the time

14699 :  its an economic crime

14700 :  you see historys rich in irony

14701 :  its a huge problem

14702 :  discard the second myth it is a big thing

14703 :  if it is i have to go to court personally i will do that

14704 :  the ministry of finance is the next tower over

14705 :  the next principle is understand

14706 :  its when i say um how are you doing today

14707 :  but it also gives them an opportunity to share something with the court that goes beyond their criminal record

14708 :  sir im not letting you speak right now

14709 :  the question works even when it doesnt

14710 :  if i believed one positive thing about myself how would my life be different

14711 :  we know that its gotten warmer

14712 :  we know where its gotten warmer

14713 :  the question you have to ask is whether a model tells you more information than you would have had

14714 :  now i use the word skill advisedly models are not right or wrong theyre always wrong

14715 :  one extra order of magnitude in space is ten thousand times more calculations

14716 :  and then you learn to be adored not as an object to be sexualized but as a

14717 :  once upon a time according to myth and legend we reveled in our goddestry and our divine

14718 :  and its going to be a lot of fun going to be cheeky its definitely going to get mucky because to get to sexy we have

14719 :  this is linked to the fact that we are both a very rich and a very liberal country

14720 :  kids get smart phones and laptops while they are still in primary school and they also get a lot of

14721 :  this means that norwegian girls may be far less free than what we might think they are because they are growing up

14722 :  but the media often portraits them as timeless facts and when we spend up to ten hours a

14723 :  and because we have taken this for granted while at the same time giving kids enormous access to

14724 :  most press mainstream and press coverage also continue to rely on men as experts in the

14725 :  if you add the time they spend watching tv and movies reading magazines and

14726 :  and youll see them around where you live

14727 :  they get a bad rap

14728 :  they are in fact the most diverse evocative poetic aspect of nature

14729 :  there is something that made it that way

14730 :  in boltzmanns scenario if you want to make an apple pie you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an

14731 :  but we would also like to understand it

14732 :  why would anyone do that

14733 :  the power of the people

14734 :  at that moment i realized that plants hold great medicinal power

14735 :  cancer stage three

14736 :  we cant impact what we dont understand

14737 :  they completely changed their lifestyle and diet

14738 :  it is the best storage device in nature

14739 :  what is a memory

14740 :  the bottom views the same person a few minutes later

14741 :  what have they done

14742 :  so i have a willing volunteer that i met backstage just a few minutes ago a brave young woman named allie whos agreed to come

14743 :  how does the field in this room right now from the accumulation of association with each other and all the great speakers how does that

14744 :  theyve shifted from feeling frustration to feeling a heart related emotion

14745 :  that was what was most important

14746 :  at heartmath weve done lots of scientific research to look at heart in a different way and to

14747 :  any time any place any way that you measure it its been between eightyeight to

14748 :  so to get more woman involved is a huge problem for wikipedia

14749 :  thats the model that you have

14750 :  women scientists the gender gap

14751 :  they raise money every year to pay the next years bills

14752 :  it was the sum of all human knowledge that was the goal of this encyclopedia but thered be a company that held the copyright but allow anyone

14753 :  how many of you said that

14754 :  the only thing worse is absolute tyranny where you are ruled by a despot

14755 :  i remember being young i would walk down the hallways of my school and i would tap rhythms to myself on my leg with my

14756 :  but once in a while cancers get the ability to express these new sugars and now that we

14757 :  what does that mean

14758 :  so if you have very lg

14759 :  what you need to do there seems like it might be simple but its not

14760 :  is it a manhattan project

14761 :  it shouldnt take away from other things

14762 :  you may need heart surgery or something

14763 :  in fact if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty by far you would

14764 :  its an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet

14765 :  what should our report card look like

14766 :  so lets think how should we measure ourselves

14767 :  in the nuclear space there are other innovators

14768 :  the french and japanese have done some work

14769 :  if you burn natural gas no

14770 :  where is there most interest in actually doing something with this

14771 :  now the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what

14772 :  so im optimistic

14773 :  one of my friends in her mid forties and she s looking what s her life going to be now

14774 :  and their hearts in the right place it s great i m all about self discovery

14775 :  i told her what i needed the dress for what i was talking about and she said oh my gosh i really need to hear this talk because i just

14776 :  but when you ask someone or you re asked like what s your passion

14777 :  but this idea that i had to know what i suppose to do now right

14778 :  except i knew i had a reason to get up in the morning get showered leave the house people who were waiting for me when i got

14779 :  i m supposed to pursue this passion

14780 :  and i had no passion for jewelry

14781 :  books coaching webinars whatever

14782 :  yes i could do that

14783 :  because it planted an entrepreneurial seed i didn t know was there

14784 :  one of my favourite columns is a piece by dilbert creator scott adams

14785 :  it s like oh my god i have to came out with a good answer for this

14786 :  because the most fulfilling relationships the most fulfilling careers are those that still have the power to

14787 :  if you re not paid to do something you re not going to be there very long

14788 :  i mean i live in new york city

14789 :  look for problems that need solving

14790 :  that when someone asks you at a party on a date at a job interview what are you

14791 :  and he was taught specifically

14792 :  i mean honestly my earrings cost twenty
14793 :  and that your life isn t worth living

14794 :  you know why

14795 :  that youre not going to have this wow compelling answer

14796 :  and that bears fruit to this day

14797 :  i loved the job i really did

14798 :  and it s not true

14799 :  and she s legitimately concerned about this

14800 :  it s just bugged me

14801 :  i was so awkward and afraid of selling

14802 :  my mother begged me she said please take a job any job

14803 :  on the day of my last show i got onto the elevator at the 36th floor and as it started to drop i

14804 :  the pressure starts really young and it goes your whole life but it s perhaps most pronounced when you re

14805 :  it always had

14806 :  he wrote a piece in the wall street journal a few years ago about how we failed his way to success

14807 :  and if you do that everything will fall into place and if you don t you failed

14808 :  the woman who sold me this dress

14809 :  she s ready to hire a team of people

14810 :  and as for the things you know you want to do

14811 :  it is the full force of your attention and energy that you give to whatever is right in front of you

14812 :  at the time i ve been also hosting a radio show for the martha stewart brand on sirius xm

14813 :  and then not long after that got cancelled too

14814 :  they dont do it as much as they should but they do it

14815 :  we talk about it in terms of engagement or non compliance

14816 :  again bandura recognized this years ago decades ago

14817 :  and this information is out there

14818 :  not a lot of cool sexy stuff happening in dentistry

14819 :  they divided them up into two groups

14820 :  theres an emotional connection to information because its from us

14821 :  if you get gum disease you will lose your teeth but youll get dentures and it wont be that bad

14822 :  you can start to unpack the choices involved because of the side effects

14823 :  i mean they complain about it all the time

14824 :  we tell you that youre okay youre normal

14825 :  they reduce speeds by about five to ten percent

14826 :  its just sitting there

14827 :  people brush and floss their teeth

14828 :  you can understand exactly what the benefits are

14829 :  it should be the patient

14830 :  its the one great preventive health success we have in our health care system

14831 :  they wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they didnt brush and floss their teeth

14832 :  its an incredibly powerful catalyst to change

14833 :  but there are all sorts of other bodies of information that are coming online and we need to recognize the capacity of this information

14834 :  because we know

14835 :  they go right to doctors

14836 :  but you dont have to wade through it

14837 :  so this patient is in their 50s so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate

14838 :  its different from compliance

14839 :  it goes all the way back to aristotle

14840 :  so fear doesnt work right

14841 :  then we use the information thats already in the lab report

14842 :  so this is an old experiment but its a really good one because it was very simple so its an easy story to tell

14843 :  so that was the low fear group

14844 :  these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down

14845 :  but it actually hits home

14846 :  who among us would actually say that people read this

14847 :  its an amazing notion

14848 :  and the people who said yeah yeah

14849 :  but you can create your own feedback loop

14850 :  it was the sense of efficacy

14851 :  fear doesnt work

14852 :  so these connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often and

14853 :  its the person who actually in the end is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new

14854 :  anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions can i have my results

14855 :  we again personalized the risks

14856 :  its not just hitting us in our heads its hitting us in our hearts

14857 :  but were not using it

14858 :  theres a beautiful quote by the romantic german composer robert schumann who said to send

14859 :  and that afternoon i had to ask him how was it for you making that decision

14860 :  and it was a dream

14861 :  i wanted to become that kind of red cross doctor that doctor without borders

14862 :  i had just completed my undergraduate and i was working as a research assistant at the lab of dennis selkoe

14863 :  suddenly what were finding with these concerts away from the stage away from the footlights out

14864 :  and inspired by what i learned from nathaniel i started an organization on skid row of musicians called street symphony

14865 :  i wanted to become a surgeon

14866 :  but i had an ulterior motive of visiting gottfried schlaug and it was this that i was at a crossroads in my life

14867 :  well yes i do

14868 :  they might be a bit exaggerated

14869 :  oh should i ask them

14870 :  we each have two aspects to our face

14871 :  it creates new demand new jobs

14872 :  it means more patients can be treated more lives can be saved

14873 :  by two thousand and twenty they will account for over fifty percent of all digital information

14874 :  theyve created jobs

14875 :  theyve raised living standards

14876 :  over the past two hundred years the world has experienced two major waves of innovation

14877 :  by the time it lands they will already know if anything needs to be serviced

14878 :  it makes products more affordable

14879 :  its the marriage of minds and machines

14880 :  human creativity and innovation have always propelled us forward

14881 :  they say that all the growth enhancing innovations are behind us

14882 :  and believe me as an economist i am also scared

14883 :  we will need a robust cybersecurity approach that protects sensitive information and intellectual

14884 :  why does any of this matter at all

14885 :  and the education system will need to evolve to ensure students are equipped with the right skills

14886 :  she already has all the spare parts because the problems were diagnosed in advanced

14887 :  would the same kind of mistakes be made with a really stressful event

14888 :  there she goes

14889 :  what do you do

14890 :  well titus was consumed with his civil case

14891 :  ive studied memory for decades

14892 :  it should have been over

14893 :  from a young age i was taught that to succeed in life you have to find something you love and follow that dream

14894 :  now skipping seems so easy

14895 :  great but how does this affect all of you

14896 :  now this may mean missing out on some leisurely activities that we all like to do

14897 :  after hours of practicing around my house i finally mastered the art of skipping

14898 :  the demand is already there right

14899 :  nearly all of them said no no we havent

14900 :  and how do we do that

14901 :  we need active system

14902 :  the philosophy behind this approach is that everyone who wants to work can work as long as you find a good match

14903 :  let me give you an example

14904 :  the way you and i cope with our lives is heavily influenced by our minds

14905 :  why did it work

14906 :  at first that feels like a much needed break and kind of like a relief but it doesnt take long before karen

14907 :  ive presented one strategy today that we know is effective in reducing sick leave by tackling the underlying problems

14908 :  karen had a supervisor who made her feel that the job she did was not good enough

14909 :  the therapists there to work with karen to rebuild her self confidence and give her the push that she needed while the employment

14910 :  surrounded by temptation bobby simply could not stay away from the ladies for more than a few days before he managed

14911 :  thats the way it is

14912 :  and weve got to do better

14913 :  i need that data in september

14914 :  i need that data in november

14915 :  go find another bank

14916 :  because thats not the way the world works

14917 :  a hundred percent of them went to college

14918 :  but we know this is critical

14919 :  comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark

14920 :  its very rare among countries to have this kind of pattern

14921 :  what about the political system

14922 :  the whole country went mad

14923 :  and which one is a democracy

14924 :  but that doesnt mean that youre a bad basketball player

14925 :  and they all tell you yes we have won the lottery

14926 :  thats because the two countries have about the same population size

14927 :  hopefully five years from now im going to report to tedglobal that political reforms will happen in china

14928 :  the picture there is khrushchev

14929 :  but china is a superstar in terms of economic growth

14930 :  you found something

14931 :  you raise some resources

14932 :  that is a point to point replacement of coordination with planning

14933 :  web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization

14934 :  how will they share ideas and opinions

14935 :  you lose the right to shape peoples work when its volunteer effort but you also shed the institutional

14936 :  im going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples but always pointing to the broader themes

14937 :  to say instead of we must make an advance plan we must have a five year projection of where the wikipedia is going to

14938 :  were now able to do that kind of thing with groups

14939 :  and i use that word advisedly

14940 :  i think that this is a really profound change in the way human affairs are arranged

14941 :  how do you organize a group of individuals so that the output of the group is something coherent and of lasting

14942 :  its taken over a wider geographic area

14943 :  it can be for profit or not profit

14944 :  a support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain a way of living in the context of a

14945 :  and thats going to happen one arena at a time one institution at a time

14946 :  the fact that a single programmer can without having to move into a professional relation to an

14947 :  so pour the gin

14948 :  and how we treat ourselves starts with how we see ourselves

14949 :  i watched the master on a tab of acid then performed after and yet myself was an unparallel

14950 :  its a lifestyle

14951 :  i mean how was i supposed to do it

14952 :  i was trapped in a cage prey among predators fighting for freedom i never had

14953 :  and i said whats that

14954 :  i couldnt read write or spell

14955 :  check this out

14956 :  candy wrappers clothing logos street signs everything

14957 :  soon after i committed my first crime and it was the first time that i was told that i had potential and felt

14958 :  ill tell you why

14959 :  ive already told you the first one first one is its really eco friendly

14960 :  because in our plastic age plastic is everywhere its even hidden in products where we never expected it to

14961 :  and while we often take for granted the services that satellites provide us the satellites themselves

14962 :  these guidelines are also not long term theyre not proactive nor do they address the debris thats

14963 :  theyre only in place to limit the future creation of debris

14964 :  was designed for end of life disposal via a small drag sail

14965 :  so maybe you get into things like high powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers as crazy as those

14966 :  so for example there are recommendations for those low earth orbiting spacecraft to be made to deorbit in

14967 :  one of the most common places we send satellites is the low earth orbit possibly to image the surface of earth

14968 :  but we simply cannot reach new heights and create an even higher garbage dump

14969 :  now mount everest is actually an interesting comparison of a new approach to how we interact with our environments

14970 :  satellites even play a role in the operation of our financial and energy markets

14971 :  people around the world rely on satellite infrastructure every day for information entertainment

14972 :  satellites there remain in the same place above earth as the earth rotates which enables things like

14973 :  or maybe a satellite needs to have technology on board to help accelerate deorbit

14974 :  and then one really cool possibility is the idea of orbital tow trucks or space mechanics

14975 :  so now you have no choice but to abandon your car where it is on the highway

14976 :  or what if that very same robotic arm could refuel the propellant tank on a spacecraft that relies on chemical

14977 :  theres also complex space laws and politics that we have to sort out

14978 :  it had to have a rider

14979 :  and its like my sexuality isnt up for grabs it isnt up to change

14980 :  now how you can help

14981 :  im telling you my story today because id like you to get into my life just for a couple of minutes

14982 :  can i join in

14983 :  you know what i mean

14984 :  i can do it its fine

14985 :  dont treat someone like that

14986 :  and they only went out for a good night not to be persecuted for who they are

14987 :  because it makes me out something im not

14988 :  and thats like i said when i wake up in the morning its a natural state of mind of cautiousness

14989 :  what i mean by that is the typical two women and the postman comes in or the two women and the

14990 :  its not fair that i have to wake up and feel like that each day

14991 :  they really believe that they can see world peace in their lifetime

14992 :  i mean he didnt even hesitate

14993 :  well working with the safe organisms that we normally work with the chance of an

14994 :  read something you disagree with have a productive argument with a friend try to see things from the other

14995 :  what do i mean by mistake

14996 :  well it means that we can come up with a new thought a new activity pattern without knowing before

14997 :  many people think it all starts with data

14998 :  every efficient procedure will be replaced by algorithms eventually

14999 :  he mightve heard the word smoke detector only once or twice but that was enough for him to understand the meaning of the

15000 :  just like the brain

15001 :  so from this perspective you have to say okay the brain is everything but perfect

15002 :  how in the world could i say no

15003 :  what could be done about it

15004 :  in both of these cases the bullying was very explicit

15005 :  but it was unbelievably moving

15006 :  i must admit when i first went to my ceremony i was not quite sure what to expect

15007 :  we have our place

15008 :  we get raped

15009 :  theres no inherent meaning in information

15010 :  in fact if only the water ice at the poles on mars melted most of the planet would be under

15011 :  somebodys going to build an iron foundry

15012 :  or we may get there a long time before nasa but nasa has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can

15013 :  and meanwhile our track record of getting to mars is lousy

15014 :  when that happened people looked at each other and said if we can do this we can do anything

15015 :  we and the russians the europeans the japanese the chinese and the indians have actually sent fortyfour
15016 :  and they prospered doing that

15017 :  but in reality he was just as miserable as i was

15018 :  ultimately if we encourage people to achieve their own value to get referendums through

15019 :  we are talking about social learning now

15020 :  creating artifacts for each other to help each other learn

15021 :  you see elements of personality

15022 :  we are also finding that learning may actually be a cause to cure depression

15023 :  i cant sit still for six hours and do any one thing anymore

15024 :  there are elements of learning that we lose along the way

15025 :  i dont just mean what code were using to write to

15026 :  this is not an educational question

15027 :  and i wonder if we can map reasonably a populations efforts at the thought

15028 :  by 4pm i had made it to mile ninetyfour and i did the math and i realized

15029 :  i cried the entire way home

15030 :  many people who contract polio in developing countries do not have access to the same medical care

15031 :  thats right its a total distance of one hundred and forty
15032 :  there was no way i was going to make that swim in my time limit of ten and a half hours because i was

15033 :  and with his encouragement at age thirtyfour i decided to go after kona

15034 :  i never would have been involved in any type of illegal activity had it not been for an untreated

15035 :  stand up for yourself

15036 :  it is time for us to remove the barriers that permanently relegate individuals with criminal

15037 :  i don t blame them

15038 :  nor do i blame the dean for his initial skepticism

15039 :  at first he was very interested

15040 :  but after a couple of years just writing songs wasnt enough

15041 :  just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable

15042 :  and you dont have to

15043 :  by preventing them from their oppression

15044 :  raise your hand and well try to get you a microphone

15045 :  how their walking sticks kept the flames alive

15046 :  will it sting less if i say it softly

15047 :  can you comment

15048 :  how i didnt harm myself or somebody else i have no idea

15049 :  my blood sugar crashed

15050 :  i was going in and dealing with dangerous chemicals having not eaten for almost twentyfour hours

15051 :  you can want it more than anything in the world

15052 :  so i stayed ill

15053 :  five hour labs were unbearable

15054 :  every eating disorder is different from the way they start and how they present themselves to the rules that govern them

15055 :  what color is it

15056 :  and one of those days mr

15057 :  but we must talk about it anyway

15058 :  without even looking at me he said its black

15059 :  in my defense though when anderson discovered positrons he was not thinking about pet scans

15060 :  i dont know

15061 :  id like to begin with my very first object which i call the uncle phone

15062 :  so we worked with a company that specializes in camera surveillance and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us

15063 :  we call ourselves pors and rao and we live and work in india

15064 :  tom and i wrote our first federal grant and our clinical trial was born

15065 :  he was a male and i was a female

15066 :  so this led to my curiosity around sex differences in schizophrenia

15067 :  the obvious difference

15068 :  we enjoyed school but we enjoyed vacations more

15069 :  tom and i agreed that we want to stimulate the oestrogen receptor

15070 :  males tend to get schizophrenia earlier on in life be more treatment resistant and have more severe

15071 :  i finally figured out how the oestrogen receptor was broken what a

15072 :  scott was a normal kid very bright in fact a boy genius

15073 :  and i imagined him being able to pursue his interest in math and engineering

15074 :  what clues did i have that guided me in my quest

15075 :  its our familys tradition to go around the table before we eat and say what we are thankful for

15076 :  theres more why their deadly symbol of the skull and crossbones was a precursor of todays

15077 :  a skilled cognitive therapist can help you change your brain to strengthen the connections that suppress fear

15078 :  pretty familiar story right

15079 :  what does it tell us

15080 :  can we change the media

15081 :  the world health organization says the average body mass index is twentyone
15082 :  youd probably enjoy a good laugh

15083 :  i know im a mother of two children and i know that we do things like we tickle our children to

15084 :  its all about improvisation its all about thinking on your feet its all about telling a story in an amusing

15085 :  i said well just like you really

15086 :  that is because theyve got no filters

15087 :  my inhibitions have dropped and thats why we change

15088 :  so its all about sex guys

15089 :  do you know whats happening

15090 :  i said why dont you come along

15091 :  and i said what are you up to

15092 :  little children will laugh little babies will laugh at anything

15093 :  theyre often used in drama

15094 :  even just smiling rather than laughing sends a signal to your brain and increases those happy

15095 :  they would do different type of material

15096 :  i dont like laughing she said

15097 :  we go from strength to strength

15098 :  how does laughing make you feel

15099 :  weve had over four hundred women entered

15100 :  weve run a competition that had seventy entrances in the first year

15101 :  weve just closed the entry for this year

15102 :  theres bound to be somebody who thinks theyre funny in the workplace

15103 :  crying is also very important because when you cry you are excreting negative hormones that are

15104 :  so thats my prescription for the future

15105 :  and this is the start of glaciation

15106 :  what were saying is two
15107 :  the layer of sand that we found is over on the right

15108 :  it depicts actually the resolution that we know most of our oceans at

15109 :  that means ninety of our ocean is very poorly mapped or simply

15110 :  im interested in whats happening now

15111 :  barbershop books connects reading to a male centered space and involves black men

15112 :  black boys deserve and desperately need more of that

15113 :  and a majority of black boys are raised by single mothers

15114 :  irby i cant read

15115 :  according to the us department of education more than eightyfive percent of black male fourth

15116 :  instead of fixating on skills and moving students from one reading level to another

15117 :  another example is the blind spot in your eye

15118 :  hearing loss is the second most frequent one

15119 :  and its a very similar thing

15120 :  it may happen sometimes with accidents

15121 :  there was a study before that showed if we hear unpleasant sounds the same region lights up

15122 :  so loud noise exposure is certainly one of the biggest risks

15123 :  so what the brain does it kind of fills in that gap

15124 :  in this case again the brain is the cause for this

15125 :  they all play their role and they interact with the sensory systems and are able

15126 :  so most people actually even after extensive loud noise exposure dont get tinnitus

15127 :  so it makes sense that this region was affected but we didnt know at the time how

15128 :  and part of our research is aiming for that of course that were trying to find ways to

15129 :  today we have scanned over five hundred convicted felons including ninety murderers

15130 :  what if we evaluated and treated troubled brains rather than simply warehousing them in

15131 :  and when you do you change their life

15132 :  when i met him at the age of fifteen he had just been kicked out of his third

15133 :  spect basically tells us three things about the brain

15134 :  probably a bad idea for your life

15135 :  that was not a surprise

15136 :  imaging was showing us there was a better way

15137 :  that was not a surprise

15138 :  over the next twentytwo years my colleagues and i would build the worlds largest

15139 :  we need a plan that adds up

15140 :  ive tried it

15141 :  we love back of envelope calculations

15142 :  i felt like i was a vessel of the future of humanity

15143 :  people i interacted with daily worked with was friends with family members that i had known a long time had never

15144 :  but i think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months maybe their first year that

15145 :  it was in theory and hopefully in practice a smart online magazine about sex and

15146 :  so im not going to go

15147 :  and i think with a death you have a funeral you celebrate the life and theres a lot of community support and its something

15148 :  and i was there with my arms open

15149 :  and she said ill never forget its just not something you want to say to a mother thats having a baby for the first time

15150 :  at the abbe museum we work daily to question our operational choices our strategic

15151 :  but shed given the boys girls names and the girls boys names

15152 :  the others are

15153 :  an innovation as you know is a huge business driver

15154 :  because they have understood they have to gain this creative confidence to innovate well

15155 :  we started to look at features how to connect the camera application to the internet

15156 :  unfortunately we dont realize it always

15157 :  i started to experiment

15158 :  all this things need to be solved

15159 :  together as a sum they are bigger than just one decision

15160 :  so it means that the moment we decide to share that information were able to get really

15161 :  so for example we already have watches wristbands cars

15162 :  so that information could tell me if that shampoo is good for my curly hair

15163 :  so the media we are shown can affect society by affecting the way we view diverse groups

15164 :  and then once i returned back to america i moved to the pacific northwest and worked for the northwest youth corps and

15165 :  the reason i read it was because abbey wrote about the desert southwest this landscape right here in

15166 :  he should have said read this book

15167 :  he wanted us to get out of our houses and into our cars and travel those lands

15168 :  the search for edward abbey and his hidden desert grave

15169 :  and then its part memoir as i ask abbey now dead a ghost mentor for me how to live my

15170 :  and instead i should have been studying for my accounting final i had a c in that class i just barely passed it in the end

15171 :  and they drove out to some great wild unknown desert

15172 :  and this was great work important work beautiful work but my heart was slowly moving toward the environmental

15173 :  and then i started reading other authors desert southwest writers i read terry tempest williams

15174 :  i wrote a book

15175 :  edward abbey and his hidden desert grave

15176 :  i think youll love it

15177 :  i resigned my position i moved to northern vermont where i met my beautiful wife sarah and i started all over

15178 :  all by cracking open one single book

15179 :  and ken sleight talked to me in his house in the la sal mountains of utah about the damming of glen canyon

15180 :  he knew he was dying because he had esophageal varices otherwise known as internal bleeding

15181 :  so what one book will change your life

15182 :  my best friend haus still my best friend after all these years joined me in the desert and we spent two nights

15183 :  he called it lake foul

15184 :  so thats what i did

15185 :  all because of reading one single book

15186 :  and then it finally dawned on me

15187 :  thank you so much

15188 :  and over a hundred applications came in

15189 :  its hard to describe where passion comes from but the goal of any of my adventures is to remind us all that

15190 :  afraid of being a failure

15191 :  and afraid of dying

15192 :  i have a simple philosophy in terms of planning and preparing for my expeditions and its called train hard and travel

15193 :  a cold place the coldest place the arctic ocean

15194 :  but it can be difficult when youre dealing with these very tough conditions physically and mentally stressed to make a

15195 :  we had a very close encounter with two polar bears early on in the expedition as well

15196 :  its a place that very few people really understand

15197 :  theres no land theres no marker that ice is moving and drifting so after a few minutes we

15198 :  and one place in particular

15199 :  am i going to own it

15200 :  we need a swab of dna and a willingness to say whats inside me

15201 :  i would be willing to participate

15202 :  i want to give you two examples

15203 :  and instead of being twenty thousand or thirty thousand last month we passed one half million

15204 :  notice they were carrying mutations from birth that were protective that were protecting them from going on to

15205 :  thats not what were looking for

15206 :  ive had some great meals at cafeterias

15207 :  and they would say well what about you

15208 :  i wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind

15209 :  i wanted it to be about religion in america

15210 :  they answered my phone

15211 :  why do we always allow ourselves to fall back on philosophical disagreements that ultimately

15212 :  and a funny thing happened when we did that

15213 :  weve found it to be an engine for creative problem solving

15214 :  my opponent ran the classic partisan playbook

15215 :  during that time he created what was called the part tool

15216 :  and in tulsa we have decided to build a city where republicans and democrats use

15217 :  he publicized a letter he sent to president obama protesting syrian refugees even though none of

15218 :  and we stuck to those relentlessly throughout the campaign always bringing it

15219 :  and i was the underdog running against a two term incumbent

15220 :  lets grasp the opportunity that is presented by innovation to build better communities for

15221 :  bynum a guy whose name reminds people of a circus promoter

15222 :  and so on election day i g

15223 :  bushs budget director

15224 :  mitch daniels served as george w

15225 :  increasing per capita income in our city increasing our citys population

15226 :  well omalley loved that approach and he applied it in baltimore

15227 :  he publicized his endorsement of donald trump

15228 :  and using this they evaluated over one thousand federal programs

15229 :  so last year i ran for mayor of my hometown tulsa oklahoma

15230 :  because when youre focused on a goal and you can test different strategies quickly

15231 :  giuliani shrunk that time frame so that crime statistics would be collected on a daily even

15232 :  that is the path to a better future for us all

15233 :  now when mayor omalley took office he was a big fan of what theyd been able to do in new york city when it came to

15234 :  and the overall approach is a very simple one

15235 :  the conventional wisdom is that to win an election you have to dumb it down and play to your

15236 :  thank you for your time

15237 :  of course not

15238 :  louisville has used this not just for their city but in a community wide effort bringing

15239 :  access our data

15240 :  is three to four times higher than the traditional grocery store and half of the revenue

15241 :  they were just browsing on their mobile site and then buying whatever they saw

15242 :  these microstudios are really key in this overall ecosystem because they take small orders

15243 :  in this integrated ecosystem social media can really redefine the relationship between

15244 :  so ive seen some early signs that the ecosystems are shifting their focus to pay attention to solve

15245 :  five years ago in a fashion study we found that on average a chinese consumer would be buying five to

15246 :  shopping behaviors and also technology platforms have evolved differently than elsewhere in

15247 :  the next morning the delivery uncle will give it to me when i wake up

15248 :  a couple of months ago i was shopping with a friend in tokyo

15249 :  so the whole experience is like youre exploring in an amusement park

15250 :  every month five hundred million consumers are buying on

15251 :  on average a consumer would spend one hour on their mobile phone shopping

15252 :  but there are really no simple answers to these questions

15253 :  a huge shopping revolution is happening in china right now

15254 :  that is exactly why im here to tell everyone that we need to watch it study it and play a part

15255 :  thats three times higher than the united states

15256 :  but of course learning is a lot more than that

15257 :  so i turned to a scrapbook i have i collect pictures or i take pictures in the scrapbook

15258 :  we need to start the space race and protect ourselves from some nuclear holocaust

15259 :  ive got these innovations that im looking for and i can also see that some of these weve seen before in fact one of

15260 :  the first is that were talking about overhead projectors and we talk about moocs and we talk about open educational

15261 :  so thats kind of my quest that is my dream and thats the kind of path i want to take you along with on this particular talk

15262 :  i get to teach university physics classes i get to run science programmes for kids and their families

15263 :  we cant wait for an innovation to come down from somewhere else and be bestowed upon us to save our

15264 :  youve got some kind of wall there youve some kind of understanding that you want to get across and its the

15265 :  in proper school fashion our crash course continues the right hand is used to keep the orchestra

15266 :  so lets talk about how we get an orchestra to actually make a sound together

15267 :  so i will im going to turn you now all of you into one giant tedx clapping orchestra

15268 :  this is how music comes to life

15269 :  so in the case of the tchaikovsky romeo and juliet i mentioned that it begins with four instruments two clarinets two

15270 :  very nice good healthy forte

15271 :  now for many of us our first views on this subject were shaped by a great colleague of

15272 :  each one has an independent voice so its like a choral and we know tchaikovsky is russian he was raised

15273 :  this is why we need great art

15274 :  all the while there is no personal expression going on

15275 :  theyre two young male chimpanzees who are being used for biomedical anatomical research at stony brook

15276 :  the nonhuman rights project argues that drawing a line in order to enslave an autonomous and self determining being like youre

15277 :  an enraged charles stewart then hired slave catchers to canvass the city of london find him

15278 :  they dont have any legal rights

15279 :  they have a symbolic culture

15280 :  we know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have and they also resemble the kind that human beings

15281 :  and so are books you might have or the cars you own

15282 :  we found them

15283 :  they dont count in law

15284 :  i love that story

15285 :  not hard to imagine

15286 :  im in so much pain

15287 :  is that a big number

15288 :  guys this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing

15289 :  and so they were given l dopa and their symptoms did improve but they werent totally asymptomatic

15290 :  they all hated each other and all moved to different parts of the planet

15291 :  so my fathers father was one of ten resnick brothers

15292 :  but maybe its a bad thing as well

15293 :  so on top of l dopa they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug and theyre effectively normal now

15294 :  well everybody can throw around big numbers

15295 :  bigger clan gatherings and so on

15296 :  humor is defined as comic absurd or incongruous quality causing amusement

15297 :  its not about making work funny but making work fun

15298 :  but eightyone of employees say that a fun workplace would make them more productive and ninetyeight of ceos prefer

15299 :  i was a project manager i got to name my projects whatever i wanted

15300 :  you choose if youre going to do the things that will get you paid more

15301 :  ive been skinny my entire life i was born eight
15302 :  and its very irritating

15303 :  and everybody outside thought we were dying

15304 :  and understand its interactions with the entire earth

15305 :  its such a huge subject

15306 :  i literally was eating the same carbon over and over again

15307 :  people on the other hand was a different subject

15308 :  and i had to call up my mother every other day saying no mum its fine fine

15309 :  i mean the media was making it sound like were were dying

15310 :  in a mangrove forest like this i have no idea

15311 :  we all went quite nuts i will say

15312 :  and i have hawks

15313 :  not me that was for sure

15314 :  and i would say that the small stuff counts

15315 :  and we knew how to fix it

15316 :  and so now all the birds come in

15317 :  and i let all of the leaves fall from the trees that i have on my property

15318 :  ive been building topsoil

15319 :  people must have thought i was nuts

15320 :  we stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant and all kinds of stuff

15321 :  so i think these slides im going to show you on fiction will address that

15322 :  and if they freely recalled some of the memories from the first session they were in and if this person talked about

15323 :  and just as with the wall how i wanted to be more wall like with this project id actually like to take more a of glacial

15324 :  for example pornography limit sexuality to a passive and voyeuristic perspective

15325 :  the post modern version of the shadows in platos cave

15326 :  after a couple of weeks when i felt ready to test my progress i noticed that despite the time

15327 :  and not only did i find out or got awareness for the fact that the brain is actually

15328 :  countless experiences online and first studies paint a different picture with the result

15329 :  he subscribed me four pills of cialis which is an erection enhancing drug just like viagra in order to

15330 :  its the ravens test

15331 :  of human intelligence is a visual test

15332 :  what about it

15333 :  and you can write that code down

15334 :  maybe that power underlies the way you think overall

15335 :  because when you adjust your mind you adjust to succeed

15336 :  so theres really no problem if we had a new tool

15337 :  who has set a goal of two thousand and thirty to eliminate malaria from thirtyfive countries

15338 :  thats two thousand five hundred and fiftyfive infectious bites every year

15339 :  but thats ok

15340 :  and my colleagues have demonstrated that if you just put two or three positions where mosquitoes can go pick up these lethal

15341 :  and i was no longer at a football game

15342 :  i never had two sons

15343 :  for the first time in many years my son could go to a football game and be safe without me

15344 :  im damn good at my job

15345 :  im a safety professional

15346 :  kids are amazingly resilient

15347 :  the kids started watching the game

15348 :  im a nationally known incident command instructor

15349 :  i worry about nicole and her friends safety every day

15350 :  another small yet a very big thing happened to me when my son lucas was born

15351 :  on the other hand when we do tours of our lab at the biofrontiers institute and we explain that we

15352 :  so were just at the beginning of this discovery

15353 :  well it depends on what you think of as our bodies

15354 :  so you probably heard that were pretty much all the same in terms of our human dna

15355 :  and so how much do they outnumber us

15356 :  what is that

15357 :  i wouldnt be surprised if you didnt understand anything

15358 :  its all in english and im going

15359 :  each group of four can use one computer and not four computers

15360 :  one last little bit and ill stop

15361 :  and he said yes and they hop across the ocean

15362 :  so they could do that on their own

15363 :  she said whats that

15364 :  i said you make your own groups of four

15365 :  the scores went up to fifty which is what the posh schools of new delhi with a trained biotechnology teacher

15366 :  clarke who said i want to see whats going on

15367 :  can you do that again

15368 :  make yourself understood to the computer

15369 :  can you show me some more

15370 :  networks broadcast in the last five years combined

15371 :  we use our products in non english languages to make sure that they work just as well

15372 :  now this was a scenario that the team never even took into account before

15373 :  it is after all their content

15374 :  only twenty percent of people sent the message to their friend

15375 :  now why would we spend so much time on something so small

15376 :  i dont think myself that whats happened is that those stem cells have made new myelin or new nerves

15377 :  all that screening occurs in animal models

15378 :  thats greater than one percent of the global gdp

15379 :  and one of the bottlenecks is early in drug discovery

15380 :  wheres the hope

15381 :  and the challenge has long been can we harness the power the undoubted power of these stem cells

15382 :  take a skin cell make it a master pluripotent cell so you could then make those cells that are relevant to their

15383 :  and that in part reflects the complexity of drug development

15384 :  so this is a proof of concept

15385 :  ive told you these diseases are terrible

15386 :  i do believe that the disruptive technologies like stem cells that ive tried to explain to you do offer very real hope

15387 :  i want to see what happens with those words

15388 :  now working memory has four basic components

15389 :  the support may come in asking people questions giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on

15390 :  it allows us to store some immediate experiences and a little bit of knowledge

15391 :  now dont get me wrong working memory is awesome

15392 :  think about things in images write things down that way

15393 :  we can be in the middle of a meeting listen to somebodys presentation evaluate it decide whether or not we like it

15394 :  its very positive

15395 :  we need to practice

15396 :  while youre hanging on to them im going to ask you to answer three questions

15397 :  just hang on to them

15398 :  some will be down to two or three

15399 :  some people can hang on to ten
15400 :  practice for some reason became a very negative thing

15401 :  everything we do is an approximation of sophistication

15402 :  how many people here are still pretty sure youve got all five words

15403 :  do i agree with the assumptions

15404 :  its a way of processing whats going on so that we can use it later

15405 :  we are built for images

15406 :  we all started as novices

15407 :  what we want to do is spin that around

15408 :  organization helps so we need to structure what were doing in ways that make sense

15409 :  some people can hang on to five

15410 :  it takes longer to prepare yourself for the knowledge economy than it did for a manufacturing

15411 :  and their parents and grandparents cant help but look at the progress or lack of it of their

15412 :  it doesnt mean there is something wrong with them

15413 :  but its not their life

15414 :  but that is not a bad thing

15415 :  now its twentyseven for women and twentynine for men and it is still rising

15416 :  the 60s and the 70s changed that with the youth movement

15417 :  because later it would be much more difficult when youve made those commitments

15418 :  and so having this life stage of emerging adulthood allows both young men and young women to

15419 :  and a lot of well meaning people want you to get there as soon as possible

15420 :  those are truths underlying them

15421 :  and eventually people will depend on you

15422 :  i think few of us would view that as a negative development

15423 :  our manufacturing output is actually six times greater now than it was in the 1950s

15424 :  its a good thing

15425 :  that will narrow the range of your choices

15426 :  where i work we also have a team of editors but we also rely heavily on other tools

15427 :  keep in mind as youre watching it that there are no graphics in this there are no cgis no

15428 :  all this sort of stuff

15429 :  and so the way that it wound up working out is there is this very mutually beneficial arrangement where they essentially

15430 :  what are you doing

15431 :  everybody were telling us angelene had been moving from one place because shes an orphan she has no mother she has no father moving from

15432 :  one hundred and twentyfive girls will not be married when they are twelve years old

15433 :  what do you need

15434 :  thank you very much

15435 :  we are making a difference

15436 :  as i went back i started talking to the men to the village and mothers and i said i want to give back the way i had

15437 :  the reason why if i ran away my father will have a stigma people will be calling him the

15438 :  these big businesses have left him by the wayside taken a lot of his knowledge from what i can tell

15439 :  so weve not added anything to it

15440 :  he planted his first tree in one thousand nine hundred and fiftyeight
15441 :  forestero grown in a couple of countries mostly west africa and sent to industrial chocolate

15442 :  three us dollars roughly

15443 :  all these incredible flavors that i had no idea existed in chocolate

15444 :  cocoa is their main export so its very important to them that they get a good price for their

15445 :  so rather than having ten oysters you have ten thousand oysters

15446 :  its quite tasty

15447 :  she would often sit with her arms wrapped around me for hours telling me stories even though her english was poor

15448 :  she was a tough woman around whom even the unruliest of children transformed into beacons of

15449 :  and in both cases women would rise and feminism would gain women rights

15450 :  she was firm but not strict

15451 :  by contrast much like i still am today i was what jungian analysts may call an

15452 :  she was not unaffectionate however

15453 :  now if the media project these one dimensional stereotypes unfortunately african men

15454 :  she was polite and did not like to take up too much space

15455 :  but she was traditional

15456 :  i first met vitaly in the spring of last year

15457 :  i dont want them rethinking what smart means down the road

15458 :  and when doing so hes creating his life

15459 :  i dont expect any part of it to be skipped over

15460 :  if she understands her emotions and she can be present in her emotions she will always be able to navigate her way through

15461 :  why did she have to go through all that

15462 :  she wants to reunite with her family there

15463 :  im too weak

15464 :  it was like a mud like lava flow had swept over the landscape in the most unimaginable

15465 :  we can try and render the chains of mass surveillance invisible or undetectable but the constraints that it

15466 :  to me thats the essence of journalism and thats what im committed to doing

15467 :  we make judgments every single day about the kinds of things that we say and think and do that were willing to have other people

15468 :  i say heres my email address

15469 :  he tried not to ever have his personal life subject to examination and so i think calling him

15470 :  to me thats the way that privacy can be rejuvenated

15471 :  its a very desolate place

15472 :  i get out a pen i write down my email address

15473 :  and you ought to reinvest and reinvest

15474 :  teachers who work together collectively collaboratively to understand their impact

15475 :  certainly what ive been doing is trying to say

15476 :  and indeed love is one of those things because almost every one of us pursue love even though we

15477 :  and the algorithm was

15478 :  my brain was like what are you doing man

15479 :  that is what it takes to change the world

15480 :  this wasnt impossible for me

15481 :  eventually im like oh my god ok

15482 :  they have something but we dont know what it is

15483 :  we must acquire and promote a new aesthetic and sentimental education

15484 :  but whether you agreed with the movements goals or not every gathering was a beautiful lesson in raw

15485 :  there are hundreds of these every day in our organizations that have the potential to distinguish a good life

15486 :  because things tend to get ugly when theres only one meaning one truth only answers and no questions

15487 :  now was it because there werent any orange balloons

15488 :  and only one

15489 :  same website two domain doors

15490 :  it s horrible to think about

15491 :  young people could get jobs going out to work for these charities and doing things in society that helped

15492 :  i know that millionaire households in the usa theres five
15493 :  id already written a very successful book in the uk in which i won a one hundred bet

15494 :  so i had a look

15495 :  i came here for the first time in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight to win a crazy bet

15496 :  we do something smarter than just taxing the hell out of these people

15497 :  i dont know whether theyre lining their pockets

15498 :  youve made it compulsory for us to have a birth certificate

15499 :  but is this nave

15500 :  i undoubtedly i feel happier

15501 :  because thats been tried

15502 :  we have some money

15503 :  just think of all the dodgy dealings that go on around the world because people are trying to get

15504 :  ill tell you what

15505 :  they lose money

15506 :  it was tried in india

15507 :  the same year we convicted two hundred and twenty tax evaders

15508 :  its about work

15509 :  its been tried in kenya its been tried in namibia its been tried in north carolina u

15510 :  its about us as people

15511 :  they might have missed a bus might have some caring responsibilities might just be a bit late

15512 :  the finnish government has said we want to try a basic income

15513 :  a job for life

15514 :  we should boss this city

15515 :  piecing it together you understand the insecurity that people are facing

15516 :  we should be pushing back against the insecurity

15517 :  adds to the insecurity

15518 :  i want to ask you to think about something

15519 :  over a million

15520 :  alaska is one of the most equal u

15521 :  if there are doctors lawyers and accountants in the audience youre not safe either

15522 :  the platform we need is something called universal basic income

15523 :  now let me tell you the reality

15524 :  we should be the boss of ourselves

15525 :  their well being was greater

15526 :  at the rsa weve done the sums

15527 :  theyre going to try it next year as well

15528 :  people stayed in education longer got more qualifications

15529 :  its working in alaska

15530 :  the insecurity is likely to spread

15531 :  finland switzerland the netherlands u

15532 :  we want to try something different

15533 :  and your health is incredibly dependent upon the life and vibrancy of this rainforest

15534 :  i was brought up in a family of psychologists

15535 :  you can call it a digital athens

15536 :  your job is to maximize it

15537 :  you figure out how

15538 :  and then baxter goes to work for the rest of the day

15539 :  that is in fact what the groups who manage to establish relationships that are mutually beneficial do differently

15540 :  what has friendship become in the age of facebook

15541 :  or with whom you do not engage in any social media interaction at all

15542 :  so i apologize if i move quickly but i have full faith that youll have no problem keeping up

15543 :  chances are i mean youre a cool and youre here so theyre probably pretty cool too

15544 :  after this awesome conference is over youre going to go out with your friends perhaps to the after party

15545 :  do you have any friends with whom you are not facebook friends

15546 :  do you have any friends

15547 :  we can do the work by ourselves but its much nicer if you are with us of course

15548 :  but the words of my grandmother kept coming back to me she was always to say

15549 :  but i thought

15550 :  oh my god where do i have to go to be able to fly like a woman as high as i wish

15551 :  now you close your vagina the gates are closed

15552 :  i want to be like that

15553 :  first of all because it puts women as victim

15554 :  and having a phd in the subject i was passionate about

15555 :  one of them is called a dopamine loop

15556 :  dopamine is the substance that you guys all crave

15557 :  math was very boring as most of you would probably agree

15558 :  by the time they got to a more advanced stage it got even more exciting

15559 :  hard does not equal boring

15560 :  he calls it deliberate practice

15561 :  lets think about it and what it means but please lets not do more of that

15562 :  but the thing is to do a lot more of that

15563 :  so clearly there was a problem with deforestation

15564 :  so we actually have some movement forward

15565 :  and actually weve done this with the teeb project

15566 :  can you imagine what that might look like

15567 :  and the other major problem is that most academics dont have a whole lot of incentive to publish outside of these prestigious

15568 :  terahertz radiation is increasingly important

15569 :  theres no change

15570 :  its very highly reflecting

15571 :  were going to have to make the light bend continuously rather than suddenly and that means not a sudden

15572 :  and it was arthur stanley eddingtons experiment of seeing the bending of light around the sun

15573 :  of course magnetic resonance imaging works through a magnetic signal so thats a way of

15574 :  i have just time to tell you about three of them very briefly

15575 :  but we dont want to do that we want to do something more sophisticated

15576 :  but what einstein was saying

15577 :  there are real and sometimes very painful consequences of speaking up

15578 :  and the state of michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem and take steps to correct it

15579 :  these unhealthy cultures that are festering in these groups where the focus is on meeting regulations

15580 :  this was science in service to the public

15581 :  now amidst this injustice flint residents were rallying together

15582 :  im not saying every scientist should be an activist

15583 :  my undergraduate years were explicit job preparation and i cannot tell you how

15584 :  amongst them were some amazing women of flint mothers concerned about their kids who came together

15585 :  you know we fell in love with science when we were kids and yet we somehow spend most of our time during high

15586 :  lead is a potent neurotoxin which causes cognitive and developmental disabilities and is

15587 :  there is also a growing culture of disengagement between engineering students and the public

15588 :  i was fascinated by it

15589 :  so we wont receive any more information back from them

15590 :  there are great ones like kipps its a great system

15591 :  there are many great models

15592 :  they get no great pleasure from what they do

15593 :  its an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to

15594 :  you think i will miss the violence or the drugs

15595 :  you are not dead

15596 :  some of them might be ones you gave

15597 :  because when systems are broken like the ones that were seeing around the world its an opportunity for invention

15598 :  but maybe me i give out something better because i give them hope

15599 :  and she said you know the poverty wasnt so bad

15600 :  we owe it to the janes of the world

15601 :  what does it mean

15602 :  and just as important we owe it to ourselves

15603 :  there was no argument

15604 :  a terrorist attack

15605 :  the police issued a premature public statement that morning echoing his claims without bothering to question it or further

15606 :  something in me just knows

15607 :  as they began to eat they heard a knock on the door

15608 :  thats all we know

15609 :  because if you believe pavlov and all the behaviorist who followed him it really shouldnt matter

15610 :  its been around for decades

15611 :  how do we do it with a dog

15612 :  its kind of in this area that i became very interested in intrigued with the possibility of trying to figure out

15613 :  but my way of doing it was like hey im cristina i got cancer

15614 :  so i decided to walk around

15615 :  so its just enough to take care of other people to take care of what surrounds us to enjoy

15616 :  ill tell you

15617 :  i love natalie

15618 :  i didnt know where to go and he was walking in the same way

15619 :  i spent one week there

15620 :  what would happen in between the hostel and the flight

15621 :  it doesnt show any symptoms

15622 :  it misses over thirty percent of all pancreatic cancers

15623 :  it costs over eight hundred dollars and it is not covered by insurance plan

15624 :  you have liters and liters of it in your body

15625 :  so find this tiny increase in this tiny amount of protein in there is next to impossible

15626 :  the average survival time is about three months

15627 :  i go in on with the five hundred plus journal articles i have read

15628 :  in addition it is rarely ordered because pancreatic cancer is what we call non symptomatic disease

15629 :  so its not an option to lower income patients

15630 :  the problem is that your blood it is already abundant in proteins

15631 :  and that sounds very straightforward but its anything but

15632 :  what i found on the internet was eye boggling

15633 :  she storms up red in the face

15634 :  usually they are just like really random symptoms like abdominal pain

15635 :  then what i realized is that what you are trying to do is kind of like find a needle in a haystack

15636 :  and three month later i landed down a date with him

15637 :  and i got one hundred and ninetynine rejections out of those two hundred and one lukewarm maybe

15638 :  so if you could detect this you would barely have to worry about the cancer then

15639 :  i finally found this one protein and i was next to insanity there

15640 :  she is like what are you doing young man

15641 :  what i found is that what you are doing is you are looking for this tiny biomarker of protein that is found in your blood

15642 :  i have realized my procedure wasnt as perfect as i had initially thought

15643 :  one percent check the box

15644 :  why have you taken our apple

15645 :  christmas is coming we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know

15646 :  its a program that richard thaler from the university of chicago and i devised maybe

15647 :  we know we should be saving

15648 :  we equate being a giver solely with that second type

15649 :  and i loved it

15650 :  i procrastinated by scrolling through my news feed

15651 :  some made bad investments

15652 :  so right now the most capital intensive sectors in the economy are the real estate sector

15653 :  i think inequality up to a point can actually be useful for innovation and growth

15654 :  what do you answer to that

15655 :  some families make huge capital gains

15656 :  so there must be other reasons for accumulating wealth than just life cycle to explain what we see in the

15657 :  cancer doesnt care where we work

15658 :  its just not cool

15659 :  and that statistic is beared out in the fact that theres less crime in the cities where theres more porn watched

15660 :  all those lets say politicians who are suddenly looking for a little boys in airport bathrooms

15661 :  this hurts people

15662 :  i want you to read the survey that you have and i want you to look at somebody next to you and i want you to look at him in the eye and

15663 :  we are allowed to draw our own boundaries

15664 :  think about that right

15665 :  in the sixteen states in two thousand and five that instituted constitutional amendments saying that gay marriage is wrong and

15666 :  these man made structures deeply affected not only my sense of space lines

15667 :  on einsteins universe we have spacetime

15668 :  in the early 21st century were making space for the big bang in amongst what we tell our children

15669 :  i thought oh my gosh this guy is going to get off

15670 :  he has not the right age etc

15671 :  it does happen it is a worry

15672 :  they go after the guy they find him the guy with the gun cant possibly be the guy who committed these rapes

15673 :  kerry robinson is in prison

15674 :  maybe it was contamination

15675 :  so they looked at more locations more powerful statistics

15676 :  i said it several times

15677 :  that man the first man is out of prison right now

15678 :  but if that person is totally into the 36th chamber of shaolin

15679 :  i wasnt that weird of a kid

15680 :  id learned to let go of the safety of conformity and i was ready to meet other

15681 :  and guess how many i met

15682 :  we hiked we swam we practiced martial arts together we could discuss anything from black holes

15683 :  we can see that with globalization the question where are you from

15684 :  we have it because were humans

15685 :  the third step is what takes us from being in an internal process to something that helps others

15686 :  i do stop ripping myself apart as a result because i see so plainly right in front of me that my story should be

15687 :  but i didnt really have time to freak out so they call my name i get up to the stage shaking im reading out of my

15688 :  that alone is reason enough to tell it

15689 :  but i also love this quote because it implies something really important

15690 :  sarah wasnt doing any of that

15691 :  i was coming to terms with my sexual orientation and not seeing it as something shameful anymore

15692 :  she was really vulnerable but so brave at the same time

15693 :  there would be lines in there where i would just think yes i felt that and thought that so many times and just never knew how to

15694 :  it feels like im taking all of this confusion and emotion and all those other kinds of art building up inside of me

15695 :  theres a lot of amazing things about teenage girl culture but theres a lot of really toxic things

15696 :  but we do need to give ourselves this freedom because maybe the best way of telling your story is through a fictional voice

15697 :  my way of telling my story has been writing for pretty much as long as i can remember but most recently writing spoken word

15698 :  not only for our mental health but also for the health of the society that were all in

15699 :  i knew i wanted to tell my story and i knew that i wanted to help people in the process i just had no idea how that

15700 :  that fourth step is inspiring others to have the same process

15701 :  its not something that we have to go through some process to get its not something that only artists have

15702 :  but its really as simple as just reminding myself that if i dont tell my story no one is going to

15703 :  there are so many individual groups that could really benefit from this but one that i would like to think that i have some insight into

15704 :  its always scary this doesnt get easier but its so important

15705 :  honesty inspires other honesty and if you can find ways to fuse these together theres so much

15706 :  so we feel even more isolated

15707 :  it implies that we already have art in our mouths all of us

15708 :  i would hide behind a lot of abstractions and kind of beat around the bush

15709 :  because i had written for a while but i always thought of it as something that should be really internal

15710 :  my motivation for doing that is thinking that if i can do this the fourth step will happen naturally

15711 :  that is giving myself permission to experiment and try things out and let my story be how

15712 :  then theres an equal and opposite pressure on teenage boys to withhold their stories and there are just these gaping holes

15713 :  my way of doing that today is going to be sharing what ill call my steps for spitting out the art in my mouth

15714 :  second step is hard because i tend to be perfectionist

15715 :  ive been so addicted to that feeling ever since

15716 :  but then conversely someone would do a poem with experiences and opinions that were completely separate from my own

15717 :  this isnt for no reason

15718 :  because you have always had a home inside the four walls of your own skin but girl i

15719 :  if shes dealing with something like a mental illness that mental illness is almost always either trivialized or really

15720 :  maybe its visually you dont know until you try and this has nothing to do with talent and everything to do with checking

15721 :  that is validate myself and that sounds huge

15722 :  this is an invitation to stop ripping yourself apart

15723 :  it turns out that this was the qualifying round to get onto the say word pomona slam team

15724 :  so we end up having to have these really crafted identities

15725 :  but then if we ignore that and do it anyway were not really taken seriously afterwards

15726 :  we see these things all the time

15727 :  this is something that i found out pretty accidentally

15728 :  i was obsessed instantly

15729 :  because there was a time when i needed you to turn my telescope to the wrong sight to make everything

15730 :  this was really crazy point of my life where i was finally really past that eating disorder

15731 :  you taught me how to turn every eye contact into silent whispers silent finger

15732 :  some of my friends made me sign up and im like ok ill do it

15733 :  fast forward about four months later i went to go see sarah kay perform in person

15734 :  id like to think that if just one of you goes home today and decides to spit out and share a little bit of art

15735 :  until this moment

15736 :  before she went on there was what i thought was an open mic night going on

15737 :  i didnt know that you had to memorize poems i didnt know some of these slam formalities where you snap and poems are pretty

15738 :  this ted talk was by an incredible poet and just amazing human being named sarah kay

15739 :  how are we going to want to tell our stories if we feel like our stories are wrong and weird

15740 :  i think it is

15741 :  people in the audience were snapping and responding and i knew that i was in this moment of really incredible

15742 :  if shes really attractive great but thats all we know about her

15743 :  i was ready to talk about it

15744 :  it was this time in my life where i just started to like myself

15745 :  you have to take risks also

15746 :  this is the end

15747 :  let me give you an example

15748 :  another way to elicit one of your highest values is to look at where you spend invest your

15749 :  anything that was a void when you grew up you end up doing everything to avoid in your adult life

15750 :  in order for us to get maximum value from our time and our life its important for us to understand our

15751 :  what kind of people do you love spending time with

15752 :  what kind of books do you most like to read

15753 :  living in accordance with your highest values means living by what makes you happy

15754 :  so rather than randomly picking from the lot get clear on what makes you happy then go find someone that is in alignment

15755 :  now is your time

15756 :  and its been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone

15757 :  and of course artists influence and change the environment

15758 :  you know when everybody is talking about insight illumination inspiration

15759 :  anyway in all these examples the computer can only emulate human defined

15760 :  but they are very good as starting points for further searching

15761 :  but what indeed is the environment here

15762 :  i really dont know why all those words begin with an i

15763 :  our century will most probably be the age of biology

15764 :  theres one way to treat jaundice and thats whats called an exchange transfusion

15765 :  probably what happened is a hospital in japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to nepal

15766 :  so we got started

15767 :  are we designing for the world that we want

15768 :  are we designing for the world thats coming whether were ready or not

15769 :  its fantastic its going to blow your mind

15770 :  so heres a problem four million babies around the world mostly in developing countries

15771 :  whats a problem you want to solve

15772 :  so we started with them saying well what do you want

15773 :  it turns out half of those kids or about one
15774 :  from a phototherapy standpoint maybe not the best behavior

15775 :  ive since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world you have to design outcomes

15776 :  im going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health

15777 :  we decided we cant put a do not enter sign next to the vent

15778 :  ive never even been to the golden gate bridge

15779 :  i was overwhelmed

15780 :  i was bringing my baby girl home

15781 :  i remember going to the fire department and making sure sure they installed the car seat safely

15782 :  i just knew i had to stop and get myself out of pain

15783 :  not sure anybody knows how it feels to not be able to provide for your daughter on christmas one of

15784 :  i was the happiest father on earth

15785 :  i wanted her just to get better

15786 :  in this case from the passenger pigeon into the band tailed pigeon

15787 :  we grow up that surrogate host until it becomes an adult cockerel

15788 :  this offers us a new opportunity

15789 :  and we implant that in

15790 :  so then what we can do with these cells in culture is that we can add a gene to mark them

15791 :  well the thing about these sex stem cells in birds is that theyre promiscuous

15792 :  were actually going to make a different sort of frozen zoo

15793 :  in this case green fluorescent protein

15794 :  and they migrate through the embryo to colonize the gonad

15795 :  and i said what would you say

15796 :  we are working to change the laws to reflect that

15797 :  i heard the comedian wanda sykes in the perfect statement

15798 :  i said what do you mean

15799 :  but when were talking i always have to remind them that im over here with cousins that write

15800 :  and we do it over and over and over again

15801 :  everybody knows it

15802 :  she should just start talking

15803 :  and she said you are not

15804 :  i looked up and saw disheveled looking woman who appeared to be shouting at me

15805 :  it was carved out of one solid piece of wood

15806 :  i turned back to the grandmother im sorry wabi sabi is that like a desk

15807 :  kill her parents this woman is crazy thats all there is to it

15808 :  i slammed my book together started throwing my stuff in my bag

15809 :  they have this fabulous tradition in japan

15810 :  within a few moments i heard shouting

15811 :  the grandmother said that beauty is a study in contrasts so something can only be seen to

15812 :  the woman with the photos above her head and me the only westerner

15813 :  every eye in the place was upon us

15814 :  wherever i would go they would within a short period of time wanna send me someplace else

15815 :  i am not i am not the president i am a teenager

15816 :  she stopped crying she stopped screaming she became silent

15817 :  he asked me if i was a model

15818 :  everyone young and old alike bowed back

15819 :  from the other room myoko chimed in again

15820 :  so were moving into a different story a different story of self a different story of the world a different story

15821 :  and this story is changing today

15822 :  physicists have dealt with that by basically relegating it to the micro realm and saying the world still works

15823 :  all of them agreed on what it was to exist

15824 :  economics you are a rational actor seeking to maximize financial self interest

15825 :  its a relatively new phenomenon

15826 :  and he asked his name

15827 :  now we must try the impossible

15828 :  well now someone is

15829 :  in your wildest dreams what are all the things you want

15830 :  but its gotten to the point where the risk associated with not helping anyone is so much monumentally greater than any

15831 :  anger can motivate you

15832 :  a battle to the death

15833 :  youre ready to be done with endless doctors appointments chemotherapy and surgeries and you should be

15834 :  as long as you have a one in one million chance you will fight

15835 :  youve been preparing yourself for this moment your entire life

15836 :  i find that most people seem to have rather low self esteem when it comes to seduction

15837 :  i said darling the publishers have just rung me up and they have commissioned me to write the very next book they

15838 :  life is a seduction even long term marriages are a constant seduction

15839 :  and they are very frustrated

15840 :  so far so obvious

15841 :  and the problem with the modern world and websites tinder and apps is that its kind of doing away with the whole

15842 :  so if you are not going to play the game of life thats fine but be aware that you might run into trouble if

15843 :  why is that

15844 :  i have no personal interest in this subject

15845 :  its kind of what were saying to a lot of people a lot of the time

15846 :  and that aspect is going to be

15847 :  he spends the next three days and nights writing a play

15848 :  they always tell me what they want and what theyre not getting

15849 :  its the play thats sexy

15850 :  they may want a date they may want a ferrari in their garage or they may want a million pounds in their bank account

15851 :  no i dont like it

15852 :  three days and nights later he returns to the bar presents the play to the actress and the seduction

15853 :  well lets look at between the lines

15854 :  what does the play with no words with the letter r say

15855 :  is it possible that leaving you wanting more is a kind of seduction

15856 :  i was working in the outpatient department at my psychiatric hospital i was consulting with a young lady who was pretty

15857 :  what their experience of you was that you were rather difficult in the first half of the date and then you warmed up to them

15858 :  what it says is dont change a thing

15859 :  then you go over and talk to them get to know them and youre entering the interest phase

15860 :  but because its a big and complicated subject im going to focus just on one aspect in the short time ive got to talk to you

15861 :  and the attention interest and maintenance model is really helpful in understanding that

15862 :  and there is something about having an impact which is very seductive

15863 :  this is a wonderful person how come they are single

15864 :  then maybe after a few days or weeks you might transition into the maintenance phase which is a long term

15865 :  and this play has a very special feature

15866 :  we all know people who we think

15867 :  and that constant cycling means that life and even long term committed relationships are a long term

15868 :  i really like this restaurant

15869 :  it has no words in it with the letter r

15870 :  you see you cant go to a petrol station and buy a play off the self that has no words in it with the

15871 :  and they think they had an impact on you

15872 :  she cant say words properly that have the letter r in them

15873 :  you now get to experience all the stuff that you would could should need to might ought to all the stuff piling up in your in baskets and

15874 :  its not about a new piece of software

15875 :  johann sebastian bach only had twentyfour hours

15876 :  what does it do

15877 :  outcome and action

15878 :  its not about a new elegant planner

15879 :  wouldnt it be nice by the way if you could experience that kind of peace that kind of productive engagement without having the danger or stress

15880 :  how long does it take to recognize an opportunity you could leverage or you could take advantage of

15881 :  how long does it take to be inspired

15882 :  there is no perfection

15883 :  its only on your mind because you know theres still some thinking or some decisions about that you havent made or you havent parked the results

15884 :  so my wish for all of you is for all of those adventures coming towards you and theyre coming towards you in order to take

15885 :  every single thing seems to demand equal kind of attention from you

15886 :  zeros and ones of productive behavior

15887 :  whats my job

15888 :  write it down

15889 :  you will feel exponentially more appropriately engaged with your world

15890 :  you have money

15891 :  can we change that

15892 :  and more than half of them arent even aware of it

15893 :  all we do is cook for these people

15894 :  i know youve done other movies besides ferris bueller but thats how i remember you

15895 :  love and respect

15896 :  but then something wonderful happened

15897 :  is that what you call it too

15898 :  and forgive me matthew broderick

15899 :  thats what the whole film was about

15900 :  i was feeling left out like i wasnt quite gay enough

15901 :  i was very very frustrated

15902 :  ill watch this

15903 :  they eat two three four dinners a night

15904 :  and thats not just about me

15905 :  great movie right

15906 :  its a wonderful day in our countrys history its a wonderful day in the globes history to be able to have an actual sitting

15907 :  they needed openness

15908 :  but the other thing they needed was speed

15909 :  thats what happens when the medias space expands

15910 :  so keeping a secret it seems is somehow toxic

15911 :  throw away depression for just a second

15912 :  now it turns out some people out there in the world use these third person pronouns at high rates and other people

15913 :  and in fact if i took that note to this author now six months later and say whats this all about

15914 :  and the answer is yes

15915 :  theres a good chance that the author will say no idea

15916 :  these are the stuff of thought these were the stuff of communication

15917 :  very naturally though

15918 :  so without counting without looking at your watch

15919 :  and we dont know actually which part of the brain is engaged in processing time

15920 :  end stage lung cancer

15921 :  what is it that you hold sacred

15922 :  we have to find something

15923 :  this ok we have to find something

15924 :  so if our plant is also shown to have an

15925 :  now for those of you that arent biochemists our goal was actually quite simple or simple

15926 :  i was very hesitant to ask for more money especially since my industry partner had already been

15927 :  so the next step was of course the lab

15928 :  i stood my ground

15929 :  the news were so sudden for me

15930 :  all i could do was wish someone appropriate would appear and solve

15931 :  these fields are computational design allowing us to design complex forms with

15932 :  and so i was working with

15933 :  for others its not the past its not the present its only about the future

15934 :  cost benefit analysis

15935 :  thank you so much

15936 :  then accidentally by playing with hippocampus he found that some cells which respond only when the

15937 :  it seems that sometimes the things may be obtained discoveries can be found dots

15938 :  how do we know it

15939 :  we dont really know what happened

15940 :  we thereof make some errors

15941 :  we can reconnect the spots and so we see the animal

15942 :  usually the scientists show some graphs or some

15943 :  it always comes to the wall

15944 :  edison just connected the dots for a long time to make an electric bulb

15945 :  we did not know how the map is constructed

15946 :  when women are prescribed drugs like anti depressants or hormones medical protocol requires that

15947 :  let me tell you what i mean by erroneously

15948 :  well i can tell you that treating pms has become a profitable thriving industry

15949 :  its out of her control

15950 :  research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets pms the more likely she

15951 :  for many years because there was no standardization in the definition of pms when

15952 :  so we have not had that at all with these so called treatments

15953 :  and they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it like anti depressants or

15954 :  one study followed men and women for four to six months and found that the number of mood

15955 :  the medical field has a long history of conceptualizing womens reproductive processes as

15956 :  we now have a limited number of symptoms and a high impact on functioning thats required

15957 :  pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits when women are convinced they should take a prescribed

15958 :  however after five decades of research theres no strong consensus on the

15959 :  now far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine but i dont think reducing tension

15960 :  the societal one is a lot more challenging

15961 :  i started my talk with quotes from wordsmiths who were separated by an ocean and a century

15962 :  were going to call that guy bill

15963 :  then there was just silence

15964 :  he brought these people with pickets

15965 :  there were big signs and they were loud and they were multiracial

15966 :  the marshall project is a nonprofit journalism organization

15967 :  and we have a section called life inside a weekly column written about what is going on

15968 :  so my dad teamed up with a reporter from newsday one of the local papers

15969 :  but guess what

15970 :  at one point one of my friends said to the kids and they were spewing racial epithets before busing had you ever met a

15971 :  where is the outcry on a daily basis

15972 :  people have spoken to them people smarter than i before me and hopefully after will address some of that

15973 :  there was a group of people who did not enjoy that benefit

15974 :  thats where the jobs were at the time

15975 :  we need to create a sense of urgency and for me one of the best ways of doing that is stories is

15976 :  at the time long island was booming because all these working class families were moving from the city to pursue the american dream of

15977 :  so where does that leave all of us here

15978 :  our history our very recent history is full of examples where journalism had a powerful impact

15979 :  i became a financial analyst and then a hedge fund manager

15980 :  that phrase rung in my head word people

15981 :  the people who support him on evidence so far are probably pretty excited

15982 :  this is not just about america

15983 :  so without further ado a huge welcome to gretchen and david

15984 :  on the other side are those who feel the headwinds of globalization and the meritocracy just blasting in their faces

15985 :  so i dont know if thats the right way to fight

15986 :  there are the foreign policies hawks who believe in america as global policeman

15987 :  read a column that is not something you would normally read because then you gain perspective of what the other side

15988 :  theyve immersed themselves in conservative worldviews if you like

15989 :  and thats sort of a warning sign kind of a problem

15990 :  theyre not going to come at this hammer and tong against each other

15991 :  thats probably not going to be too persuasive to you

15992 :  i have to throw in there also celebrity

15993 :  i think we have to have a dynamic economy that creates growth

15994 :  if im going to watch a sitcom or a late night comedy show its going to be liberal

15995 :  and as a society we do not have a secure base and we wont get to that hamilton risk taking energetic

15996 :  it didnt just happen overnight

15997 :  they see a man of action

15998 :  actually maybe theyre supporting him despite those because they see something exciting

15999 :  i have no idea

16000 :  theyre not good for today

16001 :  and listen ive written eight million anti trump columns but it is a problem especially for the coastal media that every

16002 :  i may get this a little wrong but i think of the top selling automotive models in this country i think the top

16003 :  if you get your feelings hurt well welcome to the world of education

16004 :  so how do we give people the security from which they can take risk

16005 :  i just dont think its going to work

16006 :  this is not like cable news

16007 :  but then if you actually look at a lot of his economic policies like health care reform which is about private health care

16008 :  i was told that every single day

16009 :  and so that accumulation of things and when i talked to trump voters and still do i found most of them completely realistic

16010 :  and theres a whole worldview there its a very coherent worldview

16011 :  and i have two people with us to help us do that

16012 :  and that is not traditionally the american identity

16013 :  the truth is that eightyseven percent of the jobs were replaced by technology

16014 :  are these two things implacably opposed to each other

16015 :  i sort of have more respect for him

16016 :  one the phrase flyover country

16017 :  i loathe what he stands for and i think hes wrong on the substance but its interesting to see someone with a set of

16018 :  deregulation thats risk

16019 :  and i would say no its not

16020 :  is he going to do that

16021 :  and thats been heard for years but i would say this year i heard it almost on an hourly basis a sense of

16022 :  and so if im going to tell people that they should take risks one of the things were seeing is a

16023 :  its just that we have to figure out how to do that

16024 :  it was interesting because i was looking in the audience trying to see democratic women who didnt wear white

16025 :  so while im whacking on one mole new moles pop up

16026 :  high fives in the room

16027 :  why is that

16028 :  theres been a lot in the press these days about space travel

16029 :  after almost a half a century the theory of scramjets was finally proven

16030 :  remember as the speed gets up the thrust goes down

16031 :  remember that specific impulse plot

16032 :  youve been here before three times

16033 :  so we put in a vehicle design and out pops its performance

16034 :  for high speed flight the benefit of a scramjet over a rocket is a rocket has to carry its own oxygen

16035 :  it wont be the ones lining up for handouts like cars and aerospace and

16036 :  and im here to help

16037 :  im not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest

16038 :  but now a few months on however good politicians are at swallowing frogs without pulling a face as someone once put it

16039 :  and just a few months ago president obama launched the office of social innovation in the white house

16040 :  perhaps wed achieve similar productivity gains in society to those weve had in the

16041 :  there will be a million unemployed young people here by the end of the year thousands losing their jobs

16042 :  and i spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts

16043 :  and i think more and more people are also asking why boost consumption rather than change what we consume

16044 :  and everywhere as people think about the unprecedented sums which are being spent of our money and our childrens money

16045 :  now the idea that all of this represents i think is rapidly becoming a common sense and part of

16046 :  and some are quite structural like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting

16047 :  and ever since then ive wondered why it is that capitalism is so amazingly efficient at some things but so

16048 :  we were naturally deferential

16049 :  some of the ideas are strange

16050 :  i think what this is all about this whole movement which is growing from the margins remains quite small

16051 :  and then as now it was a beautiful place of balls and punts beautiful people many of whom

16052 :  history was over and society would inevitably have to take second place

16053 :  its already immersed in social networks

16054 :  in recent years a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won

16055 :  than being exploited by multinational capitalism is not being exploited by multinational capitalism

16056 :  education six seven eight percent of the economy and growing

16057 :  by claiming that we have no power over our past present and future we give too much

16058 :  that would demonstrate what we preach and what we speak about as people of faith

16059 :  now both islam and christianity underscore the importance of social impact as critical

16060 :  there are many reasons why young african children die

16061 :  africa has had a mixed affair with organized religion with both positive and negative

16062 :  i stumbled and mumbled as i responded

16063 :  first and foremost is infrastructure

16064 :  so what has rwanda said

16065 :  the third thing was loss making enterprises

16066 :  i see it every day

16067 :  and above all we have to engage our young people

16068 :  do you find a way to stay on and fight back

16069 :  and do what you can to make that change happen

16070 :  its like a cross between a beet and a broccoli rabe

16071 :  for the first few weeks after i started working on the farm i was so tired that i would dream that i was riding

16072 :  because unlike the kinds of corn and soybeans which are the primary

16073 :  soya lecithin locust bean gum the salt solution that poultry

16074 :  so learn about this history where you fit into it and do something about it

16075 :  i think its great its fantastic

16076 :  why did people complained about the prices he charged

16077 :  and then do it over again

16078 :  this creates a vicious cycle

16079 :  do it all over again

16080 :  ben came up after we got things going

16081 :  its not going to be the state or the federal government that comes to the rescue

16082 :  why is that

16083 :  we tried to use best practices and believe me the people there when we set out

16084 :  so they had seen a lot of ups and downs and its tough enough to be a farmer

16085 :  and rather than spend a lot more time talking about it im going to queue up a little video

16086 :  and i believe that wind power is one way to do that

16087 :  two hundred and fiftysix families signed our pooling easement agreement

16088 :  its all i can do to unzip one

16089 :  has anyone here seen those

16090 :  like that comet that transformed and upset our world forever so too will women create change like you have never seen

16091 :  the fact that for the first time in our world history a female presidential candidate lost does not

16092 :  bohr said to wolfgang pauli after his presentation of heisenbergs and paulis non linear field theory of

16093 :  lets take a closer look at what you cannot see

16094 :  look what women and dark matter have in common

16095 :  and i ask back at you why not

16096 :  dark matter is unlike anything weve ever seen

16097 :  while dark matter captured the worlds imagination overnight it remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of all

16098 :  we need to redefine the way these guys operate

16099 :  and i said so am i

16100 :  and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure

16101 :  it was the end of movember

16102 :  i said to him ive got the most amazing idea lg

16103 :  they can also not medicate themselves

16104 :  they cannot prevent this

16105 :  they had no disease

16106 :  we used to think were alone in this but now we know were not

16107 :  but ive seen the sort of impact that it can have ive seen a school populated with nothing but students who were

16108 :  or demonstrating her science technology engineering and math skills by designing a new model

16109 :  this sort of new paradigm system will have projects that support meeting learning requirements while also supporting

16110 :  a report came out in the early 80s called

16111 :  today we need complex problem solvers

16112 :  of course it is

16113 :  we observed him using the video game in class

16114 :  whether or not the teacher wants to give you that time there is no choice there

16115 :  its a totally different environment

16116 :  were seeing massive change whether its social or technological everything is speeding up

16117 :  but its also all about practice

16118 :  thats when i first came across the idea that id like to share with you today

16119 :  on the face of it writing is just a simple act

16120 :  after that year was over i went back to london to write up the results of my research

16121 :  and once we understand them we will finally understand ourselves

16122 :  i think its time we turn over the tables

16123 :  that didnt go over so well

16124 :  people just did not understand what i did

16125 :  i can crush you with a hug

16126 :  so thats what i did

16127 :  and women heres what i want you to know

16128 :  you know he looks at me

16129 :  i joined this venture capital incubator as a founding partner

16130 :  is this all there is for my life

16131 :  now we have the american empire

16132 :  you know no mentioning that three towers collapsed thats quite a big mistake

16133 :  generally speaking i think we also have to reduce military spending

16134 :  it works trust me

16135 :  thats not what they say

16136 :  as historians we observe that politicians very powerful politicians tell us not to

16137 :  in one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive at the end of the second world war we only used six million barrels

16138 :  i really hope that one hundred renewable is something that we together can

16139 :  its clear that we need behavioral research to understand this

16140 :  that are particularly looked at not due to the test but there seems to be correlates of intelligence

16141 :  wrong in edinburgh

16142 :  and that becomes the explanation

16143 :  how old are they

16144 :  and your grandmother

16145 :  and you know what

16146 :  the womens personality with the slightly lower self esteem with slightly more anxiousness means that when theyre taking

16147 :  its the very latest study i downloaded it this afternoon i havent yet read it

16148 :  and what permission do you have to be bright

16149 :  we were to be rounded up and imprisoned in ten barbed wire prison camps

16150 :  my mother was born in sacramento california

16151 :  the others would be weak or cracked

16152 :  she went from anticipating one of the most exciting life changing events

16153 :  they no longer send us into a panicked downward spiral

16154 :  research tells us that lasting change doesnt come from drastic life

16155 :  when we compare the brain scans of vietnam vets with the brain scans of chronically

16156 :  we live in survival mode

16157 :  we have big stressors

16158 :  but i never felt that connection

16159 :  tidy boots is very fussy about his footwear

16160 :  actually you are

16161 :  its quite difficult to fund a private school education and feed his army of children

16162 :  they invented that tradition for their arrival here

16163 :  we never spoke to each other for three decades and then a couple of years ago i decided to turn the spotlight on him

16164 :  im going to guide the computer while it plays in certain rhythms but its going to create the notes and the harmonies itself

16165 :  but you know what

16166 :  i didnt even go down to detail about that

16167 :  when i became president the difference was thirtynine percent

16168 :  so weve made some progress partially because i was president

16169 :  in the united states of america for instance we have had an enormous increase in abuse

16170 :  so i decided to go on the ride because my dad taught me to always go on the scary ride

16171 :  why do you say i cant do that

16172 :  and that could help slow down global warming

16173 :  i dont know why it is there are some reasons out there we need to change but i want you all to think about how you can help that change

16174 :  girls now have a peer group that can support them as they go through their career

16175 :  girls are open too

16176 :  how cool is that

16177 :  theyve had a taste of code and realized this is something they want to do more of

16178 :  but if you look in your hands or in your laps or in your handbags i bet youve got a phone or a laptop or a

16179 :  i was immediately gripped by the magical and fairy tale qualities of the subject

16180 :  a man walks down a road

16181 :  and know when to be able to say that

16182 :  because it looks like youre vacuuming

16183 :  because its there but somewhere between middle school and the moment i walked up here and we become adults it goes

16184 :  i had some one minuses i put a plus

16185 :  and most people when they get their first tattoo they hide it somewhere but i didnt want to do that i wanted to make this mine

16186 :  and i said but i didnt lie this time

16187 :  i push them to advocate for themselves

16188 :  every saturday he was out there cutting the grass making sure the gutters were clean painting upkeeping making

16189 :  the same thing with my seven year old im only seven

16190 :  my father left i suspect because of this man

16191 :  its also on my right hand because you know what

16192 :  ill tell a little bit about my story

16193 :  i dont advocate for my children

16194 :  so how do we stay brave

16195 :  my dad stopped asking

16196 :  i can write something down

16197 :  and i push him forward and he has to go argue that grade with his teacher

16198 :  because you know i think i think its because im black

16199 :  just lettuce tomato cucumber whatever

16200 :  i was alive

16201 :  surround yourself with people who are better than you that are stronger than you

16202 :  to anyone of you i could walk up and say i dont like your sweater

16203 :  things were just not going well for me at all

16204 :  my mother had this view growing up which is awesome but when youre hungry its not that cool

16205 :  my maiden name in french is guerrier for warrior

16206 :  and thats the same thing that i work on everyday to teach our children to move it forward

16207 :  i still wasnt happy

16208 :  and it was one of these illnesses where you know go to the doctor they try treatment they try this try that nothing works

16209 :  my power lies within my right hand

16210 :  so after about a year of that they said ok well have to put you up on the rack and stuff has to come out and its going to change the course of

16211 :  i was doing well i was healthy

16212 :  now the problem is my brothers went to the same school so i had to convince them to do the exact same thing

16213 :  i dont have to accept all the bad things that might happen to me

16214 :  and that will help propel you forward

16215 :  and i decided i was going to put it somewhere where i can see it everyday

16216 :  so that every morning when i got up i put a bracelet on over that tattoo

16217 :  it didnt happen on that plane or on that trip to israel

16218 :  its the lone guy in a womens studies class the lone woman in a computer science class the budding feminist whose trying to

16219 :  this wasnt home yet

16220 :  its hard to explain that powerful crystallization of root feeling

16221 :  i didnt come to that grand insight quickly

16222 :  my very identity felt like it was being challenged and called into question

16223 :  i wasnt like woody allen who once said

16224 :  and i couldnt find anyone

16225 :  so these four words again

16226 :  chance has its play

16227 :  mendel but also through another member of the bengali renaissance or

16228 :  its much more subjective

16229 :  i was looking for a tabla player to play a gig with me the following week

16230 :  it has spontaneous creativity

16231 :  i was about seventeen i was playing flamenco guitar with him and he was playing beautifully on the tabla and i just wondered what had

16232 :  with indian classical music it comes from an oral tradition

16233 :  ive had lots of situations like that but i kind of ultimately think that that is

16234 :  are you a cheat

16235 :  it enables us to construct extremely sophisticated networks of economic

16236 :  are you reliable

16237 :  we were just getting around to polishing off these last wild predators

16238 :  so from that point there was a fit of opossum fever

16239 :  i discovered access to my unconscious mind

16240 :  im just going to speed up a little bit

16241 :  and that was an amazing thing

16242 :  so in the 1960s i had access to privilege and resources in a way that many south africans

16243 :  and if we identify we develop empathy

16244 :  a friend of mine said to me why dont you try therapy

16245 :  so why are we fighting it in the classroom

16246 :  lets not fight it

16247 :  and weve all submitted homeworks and your grades come back two weeks later youve forgotten all about it

16248 :  everything has to change

16249 :  we really have to completely reimagine it

16250 :  in fact i believe and i have two fat thumbs i cant text very well but im willing to bet that with evolution

16251 :  lets embrace it

16252 :  your computer is grading all the exercises

16253 :  i mean how else do you teach one hundred and fifty thousand students

16254 :  even the infrastructure has to change

16255 :  in the morning they had discovered the right answer

16256 :  you know from healthcare to transportation everything is different but education hasnt changed

16257 :  the aakash is forty dollars

16258 :  we have to move from bricks and mortar school buildings to digital dormitories

16259 :  and the results were staggering

16260 :  it s that gathering of momentum driving towards the glorious culminating final statement of the premise

16261 :  he was perhaps poeticizing plato who wrote

16262 :  one of america s first great composers was an example of this

16263 :  it limits not only our empathy and our connection but even our ability to perceive

16264 :  short short short long

16265 :  that s also not a new idea

16266 :  but it s more than that

16267 :  what is it that really excites us in the moment of a great speech

16268 :  let s face it

16269 :  music is processed in older deeper centers of the brain than our cognitive

16270 :  but that s just the way the world is

16271 :  what is that

16272 :  all performing arts therefore use music to make us feel

16273 :  we marginalize the arts in society

16274 :  yes we struggle

16275 :  after a long day unwind as you normally would

16276 :  watch the news

16277 :  when we perceive the universal we come to an observational state

16278 :  we limit the opportunity of young people to study music at our peril

16279 :  all in all i wouldnt trade my autism and my imagination for the world

16280 :  they cant speak

16281 :  for instance my little brother hes very severely autistic

16282 :  people tend to diagnose autism with really specific check box descriptions but in

16283 :  he cant talk at all

16284 :  when something very exciting happens in my inner world ive just got to run

16285 :  i can take the pain i want the pain

16286 :  so they link pain to pleasure

16287 :  so i said yes of course i could do that

16288 :  i just wish i could have a week off at home lounging around

16289 :  i told my brain i wanted it

16290 :  ive chosen to have a straight arm

16291 :  i must have my arm straight

16292 :  he trained he worked out he was disciplined

16293 :  he didnt just go yeah im the greatest me

16294 :  i kept saying i want it

16295 :  you see the right things you tell yourself the right words

16296 :  at the end he said i dont know how you did that because most people give up halfway

16297 :  i told myself i was the greatest before i even was

16298 :  well you create your own teachers

16299 :  now theyre not married and they want to go on to study further to have a career

16300 :  what do they look like

16301 :  it will bring skills and learning and reading

16302 :  but it will also lay waste to imagination

16303 :  he was going to be dead by the age of twentyfive
16304 :  almost all of that growth will be in the developed world

16305 :  thats too long if youre poor

16306 :  every child up to the age of fifteen who wants a place in school will be able to have one in two thousand and fifteen
16307 :  he employed two hundred people

16308 :  there is an amazing school in northen queensland called jaringan

16309 :  its the largest ngo in education in the world

16310 :  well grow by six cities of twelve million people a year for the next thirty years

16311 :  and we are bequeathing to the developing world school systems that they will now spend a century

16312 :  it will lay waste to social confidence

16313 :  it will stratify society as much as it liberates it

16314 :  and there will be no mistakes

16315 :  that summer we had a nurse who had been sick for a while

16316 :  i measured my body temperature several times

16317 :  the next morning i walked in to check on my patient

16318 :  but under the circumstances i figured that was the best thing that i could do

16319 :  his name was mcdow major mcdow

16320 :  when stopped by the police we place both hands on the steering wheel at the twelve oclock position

16321 :  i said major mcdow i need your help

16322 :  so i called my wife and i said were going to make this thing work

16323 :  the piece thats important about that is that we had similar kinds of experiences from idaho

16324 :  and we moved into it and we became homeowners in mountain home idaho

16325 :  so as a result of that and feeling rejected i went back to the base and i talked to the squadron

16326 :  i was just coming down to make my selection

16327 :  and so as a grandparent what do i tell my grandsons

16328 :  and besides we have a great relationship with people in the community and we really dont want to damage that

16329 :  but you know the problem

16330 :  i mean a really small trailer park

16331 :  the second thing i do is this

16332 :  nor did i get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where i could get apartments

16333 :  what can we do

16334 :  he said before i say yes to that i need to check with management

16335 :  somewhere around six
16336 :  upon first arriving there the first goal that i had was for me to identify

16337 :  after its over call us and well be the ones to challenge

16338 :  we have to challenge that it doesnt make any sense

16339 :  and so we had a great sleep that night

16340 :  thirty seven oclock we got a little bit tired and we said why dont we get a motel so that we can rest and then have an early

16341 :  how do i keep them safe how do i keep them alive

16342 :  i said i would like to get a motel for the evening for my family

16343 :  we do everything that you told us to do

16344 :  so what i did and he said you shouldnt worry jim because there are a lot of trailer parks so i put

16345 :  we were rejected from hotels motels and restaurants

16346 :  you need to push back you need to challenge

16347 :  and heres what the boys have been taught to tell them we know that you can do that but please do not do that

16348 :  so climate change

16349 :  without those protective factors in his life christopher would be more likely to commit further more serious crime

16350 :  why are we spending eighty billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing when we could take that

16351 :  i would choose whether to leverage christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial and ultimately i would be in a position to ask for

16352 :  the potential jail time he faced is what stressed christopher out the most

16353 :  i came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice but i never learned what justice was in my classes none of us do

16354 :  the next time theres a local district attorneys election in your jurisdiction ask candidates these questions

16355 :  i was standing in arraignments that day when christophers case came across my desk

16356 :  those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison and it was during those meetings with those men that i

16357 :  queer voices non queer voices and i was lucky enough to have access to all of these different

16358 :  a lot of us use reading to escape our reality

16359 :  he built a house around him made of cardboard and wood from the garage

16360 :  i dont want to talk about it

16361 :  and this really needs to turn into something much bigger

16362 :  because the thing about peter is he was never afraid

16363 :  i became friends with hermione granger and junie b

16364 :  and theres a couple reasons for that

16365 :  i cant tell if the slick water lines are rivers leading from his temples or just under his eyes

16366 :  so i played a lot with visual form and language

16367 :  and as a writer i focused mostly on queer youth narrative

16368 :  look what i made

16369 :  and i became friends with characters in books

16370 :  which is why i started writing peter and the concrete jungle

16371 :  why do they move like they move

16372 :  i understood mathematics is about life its about nature it is

16373 :  we have programming languages that is so easy

16374 :  let me tell you a little bit about what ive done

16375 :  i thought it was detached from life

16376 :  but i thought it was boring

16377 :  what we do in our culture and what we say about mathematics and science it really matters

16378 :  i really wanted to communicate that out to the world

16379 :  lets play more games

16380 :  we simply dont know

16381 :  i thought it was cold

16382 :  we can then go to the computer and simulate this behavior

16383 :  we did it to tell a different story about physics and mathematics trying to

16384 :  i could do the formulas

16385 :  what is going on

16386 :  that enables our kids and our friends to fall in love with science

16387 :  its representing these things in numbers so they go back to the world with new insight

16388 :  i am not a pessimist though thats how i may sound to some of you today

16389 :  it is rather the same thing thats happening to the english language

16390 :  it becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish but the slovenliness of our language

16391 :  never use a foreign phrase a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday

16392 :  and finally a sixth rule which is very very orwell

16393 :  a man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure and then fail all the more completely

16394 :  he was almost as hard on western governments and authors for their slovenly and jargon

16395 :  they resort therefore to carefully prepared and highly spun one liners or to staccato

16396 :  even our dear monarch has to endure this when she reads out the queens speech at the beginning of each session of

16397 :  never use the passive where you can use the active

16398 :  the best you can hope for from them these days are what are known in the trade as well rehearsed

16399 :  orwell went on

16400 :  george orwell wasnt a pessimist either back in one thousand nine hundred and fortysix
16401 :  justice will go astray

16402 :  orwell rounded off his classic essay with six rules which if i had my way would be

16403 :  so taking stories across platforms

16404 :  being embarrassed of who you really are

16405 :  i say that as somebody who has pioneered trans media storytelling

16406 :  and we are now friends and on a regular basis we remind him and his team of the promises he has made

16407 :  he signed a promise to help the people of bali say no to plastic bags

16408 :  we went to india to give a talk and our parents took us to visit the former private house of mahatma gandhi

16409 :  all we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home

16410 :  if youre a fellow rotarian nice to meet you

16411 :  i am only the messenger

16412 :  and how are we supposed to know what works if we cant trust research

16413 :  i mean thats so cool

16414 :  you want to touch them taste them smell them you cant get enough of them

16415 :  they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody

16416 :  no surprise fewer than half of teenage girls age fourteen to seventeen have ever

16417 :  girls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals

16418 :  it rose eighty percent between two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and fifteen and whereas girls under

16419 :  it was that girls didnt want them to

16420 :  and theres nothing wrong with wanting to feel close to your partner or wanting him to be happy and orgasm isnt the only

16421 :  who is the primary beneficiary

16422 :  in the largest ever survey ever conducted on american sexual behavior they reported

16423 :  but it wasnt always that boys didnt want to

16424 :  the one who makes out with a partner for three hours and experiments with sensual tension

16425 :  my grandmother was a firecracker my mom is a professional my sister and i are loud and thats our

16426 :  consider a survey of three hundred randomly chosen girls from a dutch and an

16427 :  if you have those diced salty almonds and youve eaten them

16428 :  who has copper pipes

16429 :  and we used to think isnt that great

16430 :  and also who eats off a pyramid anyway

16431 :  it decides what should be let through into memory and what should not be let through

16432 :  or copper pipes

16433 :  and this is my most important point

16434 :  so you want to get it from food thats the form that nature has designed for us and thats the form that weve evolved with

16435 :  until we realized iron is a double edged sword

16436 :  so back into the laboratory

16437 :  that purple color those anthocyanins happen to be powerful antioxidants

16438 :  i left my frying pan on the picnic table and it rained last week

16439 :  theres something about salty cashews and almonds is it just me

16440 :  and the fact that its solid at room temperature is a sign that bacon grease is loaded with

16441 :  and if thats the case then i need a fire extinguisher

16442 :  you see the middle class grow

16443 :  my ipods full of them

16444 :  perhaps africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made

16445 :  you can go and buy some of the great tunes

16446 :  a bit dangerous sometimes

16447 :  theres also some evidence that the healthy microbes on the coral can fight off the

16448 :  what else are all of the unseen microbes doing to keep us and our oceans healthy

16449 :  how do we help the reef that looks like the right back towards something that looks more like

16450 :  there may be less oxygen present there may be more pathogens there and there may be toxins produced by some of

16451 :  but microbial ecologists have desperately needed breakthroughs in technology such as with this fast

16452 :  my goal is that after this short journey youll share my amazement at how deeply connected our lives

16453 :  i find that astounding

16454 :  so lets try again

16455 :  thats pretty much it

16456 :  ladies and gentlemen were about to make a landing on the water

16457 :  i want to tell you four jokes today

16458 :  what is food justice two
16459 :  im like yes i got that

16460 :  i want them to know that i have not forgotten them

16461 :  eat mostly plants

16462 :  as if what we are doing one day will save lives

16463 :  thank you very much

16464 :  but what fascinated me more is that maddies curiosity took her to a new level

16465 :  corruption is rampant

16466 :  lets go forward

16467 :  not really good at that whole green yellow blue thing

16468 :  so here is the first set

16469 :  if we were to look at the raw data from these telescopes

16470 :  one of them is biomedical and one of them is astronomical and you have to pick them correctly in

16471 :  i play this with new doctors and astronomers i work with

16472 :  all i can say is it has just been wonderful

16473 :  so were going to play a little game i like to call which is which

16474 :  again we cant move

16475 :  why the bus cant adapt to what you need

16476 :  it takes dozens of years if at all until the new subway line gets there

16477 :  even the ongoing operating expenses of most of the worlds public transportation

16478 :  i want to show you what the future of public transportation looks like

16479 :  think about it

16480 :  what are some of the other options

16481 :  if youre not aware it is the brainchild of bas lansdorp

16482 :  i know to me when i think about losing weight that is so daunting

16483 :  after all i could craft an entire day for you minute by minute vegetable by

16484 :  one more piece and im going to be sick

16485 :  it has to be your own good plan

16486 :  what if we think about that differently

16487 :  and this is where youre going to eat that chocolate cake no distractions

16488 :  instead of exercise what if we just talk about moving your body

16489 :  he lost over twenty pounds and more importantly his numbers came down into the normal

16490 :  he was ready to make a change

16491 :  so start today somewhere take one piece take one thing that ive said

16492 :  whether you are talking about ten pounds twenty pounds fifteen pounds it doesnt really matter

16493 :  and by good plan i mean it has to be something that feels good because if it feels good you are more apt to

16494 :  which one feels better

16495 :  and then you know life kicks in the busyness happens and i got out of that habit

16496 :  you have to give yourself permission to take better care of you

16497 :  he took his own good plan and he made it his own and i think thats important because thats the reason why he stuck to it

16498 :  and its truly human nature to want what we cant have

16499 :  so does it feel good to you when you say id like to lose twenty pounds or if we look at it

16500 :  did you walk at all yesterday

16501 :  his cholesterol his triglycerides his blood pressure

16502 :  but it all goes back to your desire

16503 :  because you know when we are headed on a healthy path many times the concept of chocolate cake

16504 :  just do it just start somewhere

16505 :  think back to yesterday and how much you moved your body how much water your drank how many

16506 :  think about how much water you drank yesterday and just drink a little bit more today

16507 :  so you need to grant yourself permission to eat that cake

16508 :  i like being strong and i used to do twentyfive push ups most mornings

16509 :  and just do a little more today

16510 :  and again you need to honor your body

16511 :  because again a good plan is something that you can do and if a good plan is something you can

16512 :  it is because of what it stands for

16513 :  it reacts both to positive and negative emotions like sadness happiness pleasure or

16514 :  but one day i had to cry

16515 :  did you know that there are three types of tears

16516 :  my dislike of words made me excel in the better subjects such as physics mathematics and

16517 :  throughout this ive been working with unsung heroes and invisible angels to bring innovative e

16518 :  i got you in a frame

16519 :  and a frame is just a window

16520 :  brittany did that

16521 :  when you start to think positive opportunities open and doors open

16522 :  not only are you positive thinking but youre also giving time to self love yourself

16523 :  when you act you start to behave it and mimic those things that you feed into and what

16524 :  i am valued

16525 :  what is your value

16526 :  because society has labeled me not only unhealthy but unfit

16527 :  because for me it took a lot for me to stand here and say i am worth something

16528 :  and i will say yes this is true but this is more important to me than that

16529 :  what is the capital of france

16530 :  great google away

16531 :  and he prepared all three steps equally well

16532 :  and if there was somebody who immediately understood this it was a swedish web developer a search engine optimization expert

16533 :  am i looking for an isolated fact

16534 :  but let me first elaborate just a little bit on a basic principle behind each search query that we sometimes seem to

16535 :  you dont see a big conspiracy among those things

16536 :  and it worked too

16537 :  there was a picture distributed widely over the internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey

16538 :  so whenever you set out to google something start by asking yourself this

16539 :  youre right youre wrong

16540 :  this is when we start to argue to form society

16541 :  i will show you why that philosophically is almost an impossibility

16542 :  we believe in you we dont believe in you

16543 :  the humanities and the technology

16544 :  and if nothing else to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased clean search result

16545 :  and my message goes out not only to google but to all believers in the faith of code around the world

16546 :  strangely enough i always get the same three answers

16547 :  and what were looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in

16548 :  and ill tell you why

16549 :  i got an email on my phone

16550 :  actually we had just climbed the tree

16551 :  what we saw was that people throughout asia people throughout africa throughout south america they told us

16552 :  and yet here we are today about half of the rainforest remains and we have potentially more urgent problems like climate

16553 :  everyone had just gotten back down

16554 :  they can listen to the sounds of the forest

16555 :  but you have to have a device to go up in the trees

16556 :  nobody thinks it is

16557 :  right now they dont and it would be great to find a way to better communicate it because we have not

16558 :  some people dont

16559 :  should those be in the new package of goals

16560 :  often theyre not in the right place

16561 :  all of this is measurable and could be in the new goals

16562 :  so what kind of problems

16563 :  its like being on the surface of the ocean and just bobbing all the time and not ever

16564 :  its human of course to have these kinds of emotions but what we dont have to

16565 :  a lot of buzzing of the mind

16566 :  the image i like best is a flashlight we can use the mind like a flashlight

16567 :  we have appetites

16568 :  so this is my point

16569 :  on the other side of the planet in the amazon weve got many tribes which practice what

16570 :  and im not saying there was no pair bonding going on

16571 :  youve known these people your entire life

16572 :  nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism but its not who you are

16573 :  im not saying that they didnt love the people they were having sex with

16574 :  all cacilda and i have done is extend this sharing behavior to sexuality

16575 :  conveniently enough this brings us back to one of those buzzwords so beloved by

16576 :  and all too often when we do see women represented in the culture its through whats known as the male

16577 :  unsurprisingly this has major repercussions for how girls and women view themselves

16578 :  de beauvoir notes that a woman when admiring or she puts it

16579 :  because here we have for the first time thanks to technology a way for them to hold on

16580 :  even now in the west after three waves of feminism and a possible fourth blossoming at this point

16581 :  as a researcher working in the field of cultural studies i am well aware that when it comes to representation in our

16582 :  it creates what it names

16583 :  why at this particular point in time are some young women choosing to self

16584 :  and although the article goes on to ultimately debunk this idea that millennials are without hope

16585 :  is taken to represent everything that is wrong with her generation

16586 :  from soap operas to fashion cultural products coded as feminine are generally regarded as

16587 :  and that word is narcissism

16588 :  to give themselves communities and role models where there are none striving for visibility in a

16589 :  seems to be the undertone to many of these conversations

16590 :  even the charge of narcissism becomes so much more complex when considered in relation to

16591 :  people want to talk

16592 :  so we prefer organ specific cells

16593 :  they are not nearly as complex as hollow organs

16594 :  we can use it from one patient to the next

16595 :  but they are really acting mostly as conduits

16596 :  it disintegrates a few months later

16597 :  a windpipe cell already knows its a windpipe cell

16598 :  and thats actually what youre seeing

16599 :  its acting only as a cell delivery vehicle

16600 :  we started implanting some of these structures over fourteen years ago

16601 :  and even if she manages to have both at the same time she might not get the

16602 :  women are said to have absolutely no sense of direction

16603 :  and yet there is another sense of space that women do have and men dont

16604 :  equal and complementary

16605 :  i would never agree to the idea of a predetermination of function based on

16606 :  women are said to be much more emotional than men and by the way in the context of company

16607 :  sense of direction

16608 :  and thats the sense of detail in a smaller space

16609 :  equal but different

16610 :  thats usually what people talk about

16611 :  they know time runs fast

16612 :  and the law is set many times because of the fights of very courageous women and some

16613 :  and theyre less political maybe because their life doesnt revolve around their career only

16614 :  it is so easy to find the negatives in school

16615 :  i know it can be hard trust me i struggle with it everyday

16616 :  i know from personal experience

16617 :  i was able to use precompiled code libraries and follow other schematics and in doing so i was able to

16618 :  its from these open collaborative communities that comes the amazing potential but its

16619 :  now were aiming to manufacture and distribute boats and boat kits by the end of this year

16620 :  i prayed for them and things started to change

16621 :  thats the reason as a woman i joined the indian police service

16622 :  i had other options but i didnt choose them

16623 :  for me the policing stood for power to correct power to prevent and power to detect

16624 :  i said all right lets pray

16625 :  and since i said theyre my role models i followed two things which my father and mother gave me

16626 :  im the only one whos left in india

16627 :  now at first i would have believed them

16628 :  and to be honest sometimes i quite enjoyed their attention as well

16629 :  fourteen minutes is not enough time to fully credit those good and generous people who fought with me and

16630 :  and menacing so in this respect a vital first step was learning to separate out a metaphorical meaning from

16631 :  you see that glass of water

16632 :  this record that i wrote started in a motel room in spearfish south dakota

16633 :  its that there is no point and that there doesnt have to be a point

16634 :  we dont need a reason

16635 :  the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger

16636 :  and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride

16637 :  and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags

16638 :  one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras

16639 :  and weve continued to do it every year

16640 :  its a prank but its a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell

16641 :  i used my faith my friends my family

16642 :  thats what you want to engage in

16643 :  we need other people

16644 :  whether i was a good person or a bad person

16645 :  but failure is nothing more than a setback

16646 :  the other area was my view of failure

16647 :  so again i dont know what the scale is for you but think about retraining your mind to define success in another

16648 :  and it is your mindset

16649 :  i was in the grips of real loneliness back then but i was surrounded by people all day so it

16650 :  and that is how much more we value the body than we do the mind

16651 :  i stumbled out of bed i put the phone back on the receiver and it rang a second later and it was my

16652 :  he cried for a minute but then he got back up got back on the stool and reached out for a box of

16653 :  i believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing

16654 :  our mind is hard to change once we become convinced

16655 :  weve known it since we were five years old

16656 :  he was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth when he slipped and scratched his

16657 :  you just go down to the drug store

16658 :  we kept trying to engage her but she was shy

16659 :  i dont tell them who i am

16660 :  can you get a woman to accept those polio drops in her childs mouth

16661 :  they wont have anything like that

16662 :  well we got hundreds of ideas

16663 :  and they start to see others doing it and saying wow i want to do that with my own money

16664 :  there was a lot we didnt know

16665 :  we started asking ourselves questions

16666 :  i guess theres a long version and a short version of that

16667 :  that was eradicated so that got down to zero

16668 :  we look and go wow

16669 :  pair of khakis

16670 :  for me i come at it from intuition

16671 :  i was actually really excited

16672 :  were not trying to homogenize it

16673 :  tradition here which is the strongest is the envy of the world

16674 :  were there things that werent being done

16675 :  but the thing that we learned from that work and what turned out to be the fundamental key is a great teacher in front

16676 :  it was incredible

16677 :  maybe a few of those will work out

16678 :  bill had never taken that much time off from work

16679 :  he said i dont know how im going to pay for her education

16680 :  people give to some things

16681 :  they have less violence and crime in those schools

16682 :  they bring down the dropout rate

16683 :  but we were stunned

16684 :  its incredible how people think okay that could be me and the money flows

16685 :  so she kept wanting to talk to me and jenn

16686 :  we can spend aid smarter

16687 :  bg we had never expected it and it has been unbelievable

16688 :  i cant pay for private school and she may end up on this farm like my wife

16689 :  how on earth did that happen

16690 :  what is the time and this feeling this spinning into the inside of my stomach

16691 :  thats why its so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world

16692 :  because in fact this is child labor

16693 :  dont make it africa

16694 :  dont make it a race issue

16695 :  you can watch me for one minute now and youll see the whole thing

16696 :  the last chapter is about present and president obama and the other is about the past where you

16697 :  we have all this at the same time

16698 :  and asia could have social development before they got the economic development

16699 :  and how fast has this happened

16700 :  and when it comes to free data and transparency united states of america is one of the best

16701 :  does your mindset correspond to my dataset

16702 :  this is not the state department

16703 :  thank you very much

16704 :  make it a local issue

16705 :  because after all talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the united states

16706 :  and one week ago for the first time there were four lines on the internet

16707 :  it will never affect a rich person

16708 :  that has now disappeared and they are now in great economic problem

16709 :  and we have a high hope in you

16710 :  quite the opposite of the world bank who compiled data with government money tax money and then

16711 :  this is a matter of economic benefit this can really change the way we work live and play why would we not do something about it

16712 :  that all changed with one incident

16713 :  to get the voices from the field heard in places far away so those concerns dont

16714 :  for example in sudan we were able to get local communities to express their

16715 :  thats exactly what the role of organisations is supposed to be

16716 :  thats one of the roles the united nations can play

16717 :  what do you mean by religion

16718 :  i have asked many thousands of people this question over the years and typically we get very similar lists of

16719 :  the in group of the people who are like me and the out group for the people who are not like me

16720 :  im not but you are

16721 :  you might find that other people make you really hostile or angry

16722 :  but the word love in the english language is fairly sloppy you may have noticed this we say i love my

16723 :  the idea is you find the synonym that works for you but collectively we bridge by using this

16724 :  there are dozens of other synonyms that you could pick from

16725 :  why is it that we are so annoying to each other

16726 :  but its a big step forward from apathy so this is good

16727 :  most of us are quite annoying at least to each other

16728 :  this is also tremendously difficult because when you start feeling all the suffering on this planet you can feel

16729 :  ninety of it facebook no forums no not good information

16730 :  it was perfect

16731 :  and thats the thought of having brain damage

16732 :  its halfway between los angeles and san francisco

16733 :  can we get that

16734 :  thus i would have no craniotomy no movement of my brain and this would eliminate the risk of

16735 :  and he relented and ordered the mri

16736 :  and of course this impacted me very deeply

16737 :  why dont i share with others

16738 :  is it even one person job

16739 :  much has changed much has gained but much has been lost

16740 :  and if we break it if someone breaks it we all will starve

16741 :  and how terrible their mistakes were

16742 :  now thats a really serious problem

16743 :  youre having to imagine it

16744 :  he was saving the world so i wanted to save the world

16745 :  you cant catch it from anyone

16746 :  that is our fault

16747 :  and please buy them

16748 :  and that is not mikes fault

16749 :  people will think its cute

16750 :  because its important that boys play with and as female superheroes just as my daughter

16751 :  and dont just buy them for your daughters buy them for your sons

16752 :  now the show is marketed to girls ages five to nine but there are millions of boys

16753 :  now i am not a graphic artist in any way shape or form so i made the page as pretty as i possibly could

16754 :  well go for a hundred bucks

16755 :  ill do it even slower

16756 :  i can make this twenty bucks change into whatever you want

16757 :  shout out make some noise

16758 :  ask him to name out one suit

16759 :  and on that note enjoy the rest of the tedx and have a great day

16760 :  im going to need to borrow something actually from the audience

16761 :  the only rule is that person cant be in the room with us right now

16762 :  how were we to do it

16763 :  it also means that of the young generation almost one in two people has never had

16764 :  i can give you another example

16765 :  they are pretty hard nosed because im asking them to put their money to put

16766 :  japan japan japan

16767 :  i want to talk a little bit about innovation

16768 :  oh my god the population is declining therefore its terrible

16769 :  demographic sweet spot

16770 :  there is more money around

16771 :  this has something to do with that is driven by the population dynamics of japan

16772 :  how are we going to do that

16773 :  this is very important

16774 :  this is how we can manipulate the sleep that we do get in order to get the most out of it in order to

16775 :  we all know we live in a sleep deprived society

16776 :  and these symptoms were the fact that they lost their memories they couldnt learn new things and they

16777 :  let me explain to you an experiment which shows this

16778 :  right now our results are very promising so were hoping that in not too many years we might be able to offer a sort

16779 :  now interestingly as we age our sleep patterns also change

16780 :  instead im going to talk about something which i think is much more interesting

16781 :  but subsequent research has shown that he was absolutely right

16782 :  its helping us to strengthen up memories

16783 :  so wouldnt it be great if there was a way that we could maintain those slow

16784 :  so im sure some of you have had a traumatic experience at some point in your life

16785 :  contrary to popular opinion the brain doesnt just switch off when we go to sleep instead it goes through a

16786 :  you may have been mugged you may have been in a car crash maybe other things that happened to you that youd really you

16787 :  instead of just measuring our sleep we could be using the information that we now have about

16788 :  press as many four one three two four sequences as you can

16789 :  responsibility is not something that you do

16790 :  its something you are

16791 :  heres the problem

16792 :  what i want to focus on specifically is what i see as the dominant trend in technological innovation today

16793 :  let netflix think and act for you

16794 :  challenge as an example

16795 :  you know why

16796 :  how could you know that

16797 :  yves complained a lot as well

16798 :  its all good its fresh air nature elks skiing its fantastic

16799 :  why is it a free for all and first come first served

16800 :  now im just going to check

16801 :  if they open another cash register the same will happen

16802 :  listen to the answer pick out a word follow up that word

16803 :  the norwegian forest is a good thing isnt it norwegians in the room

16804 :  the rules of engagement of small talk

16805 :  why are they running for that cash register

16806 :  rule number one
16807 :  so thinking about those things together feels right

16808 :  so its reasonable to say that grand crossing is already in the process of being something different than it

16809 :  can you get those folk talking

16810 :  if youre a man youll have to represent your gender

16811 :  its always so nice to look out and see so many women

16812 :  it was chock full of data and figures i had three pages on matrilineal maasai

16813 :  because i think when the book first came out many people thought well this is a really important handbook for young women

16814 :  pursuing the corporate world

16815 :  i said on the ted stage

16816 :  because year after year i was one of fewer and fewer and now often the only woman in a room

16817 :  i certainly have done a lot of research

16818 :  i got this great one of the first letters i got was from a woman who said that she was offered a really big

16819 :  right which i admit i do

16820 :  the kind of partners they want if at all

16821 :  it will end your business career

16822 :  that wouldve been great

16823 :  and it turns out everywhere in the world women need more self confidence because the world tells us were not equal to

16824 :  or worse if you say woman people on the other end of the table think youre asking for special treatment

16825 :  that its not good enough that its not changing quickly enough

16826 :  if you are a black woman sixtyfour cents

16827 :  i met one of them i was in beijing

16828 :  we need more than that

16829 :  and neither does german

16830 :  do we really want to end up with six hundred languages and the main one being english or chinese

16831 :  it can be as hard as trying to learn a new language

16832 :  i started learning about conflict because i was terrible at it

16833 :  i asked her how she was feeling

16834 :  she said i dont want to put them in the tray

16835 :  i also have to recognize that because conflict is about change theres going to be some loss involved

16836 :  i no longer see conflict as negative

16837 :  so i tried to put a stop to it

16838 :  now i am no stranger to being stuck in conflict

16839 :  after fifteen years of studying researching teaching and training in conflict ive learned

16840 :  its hard work though

16841 :  i cant even get my four year old daughter to pick up three hair pretties

16842 :  after i ask i can listen

16843 :  it takes three keys in order to do that

16844 :  can you help me understand

16845 :  ive never done this before

16846 :  what if conflict isnt a problem

16847 :  i told her about how i was bullied when i was a kid

16848 :  i dont want that

16849 :  but ive been worried and sad

16850 :  i tried to breathe in and let go of my desire to have her respond

16851 :  how you can create the change that you want

16852 :  we discussed how she could set boundaries with kids at school

16853 :  your golden years are right now

16854 :  spread your risk around

16855 :  while i had been saving some money for my ultimate retirement i had also been putting money aside

16856 :  dont put all of your eggs in one basket

16857 :  under that scenario you could still be an intern when youre fifty and when you reach the age of seventy learn that youre only

16858 :  a couple of years ago prudential unveiled a billboard that said that the first person was born who will

16859 :  intuit the software company estimates that over the next four years

16860 :  instead of waiting until the final chapter of life to retire we should take small interim

16861 :  dont do that

16862 :  living to be that old

16863 :  id go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic

16864 :  weve got to go out there and clean this thing up

16865 :  thats an order of magnitude up or down

16866 :  its good for your health and for your productivity

16867 :  eight billion times a day that tune is played

16868 :  music is very powerful and unfortunately its veneering commercial spaces often inappropriately

16869 :  if we all do that we move to a state that i like to think will be sound living in the world

16870 :  i hope thats going to change over the next few years

16871 :  so if i were to play this

16872 :  and what they found was that when you combined the virtual laboratories with teacher led coaching and

16873 :  go back to the mortgage and fuel crises of two thousand and eight
16874 :  why were people still allocating capital and markets that were obviously still a bubble

16875 :  at generation we call the other two thirds of those reserves stranded assets assets whose economic value will

16876 :  generation has been managing eleven billion dollars of public equities on behalf of our clients where weve been integrating

16877 :  become better informed about these issues and drive the message forward because to change the

16878 :  next time that youre investing your personal savings or your pension ask some questions about where that capital is

16879 :  we dont publish our track record on a regular basis but over the past ten years our outcomes for our

16880 :  in rural african populations that are not connected to the grid and even often unbanked

16881 :  but im giving a tedx talk and you dont know how happy my mother

16882 :  he also had the wonderful feast of dancing and food and it was his turn to stand in

16883 :  we get an insight into how clients and banks and lawyers go to

16884 :  its just because of the way in which offshore works mossack fonseca has fewer

16885 :  what are the planetary boundaries within which we can safely operate

16886 :  all for one

16887 :  it may surprise you that its not only climate

16888 :  now as a scientist whats the evidence for this

16889 :  but if you took this thirty percent these three hundred people and had them nominate their friends and took the same number of

16890 :  would you get any population level immunity

16891 :  we took one thousand three hundred randomly selected undergraduates we had them nominate their friends and we followed both the random

16892 :  so if we have a population of a thousand people and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen we dont have to

16893 :  so one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics

16894 :  he had no family to support him

16895 :  you see traditionally the study of microbes had been focused on the role of pathogens those

16896 :  i think that these interactions may have a very important role for us maintaining our human microbial

16897 :  antibiotic treatment can also impact the microbiome

16898 :  just one thing led on to another

16899 :  and ended up a night in prison

16900 :  and weve spent two years looking at the war on drugs

16901 :  bransons idea and his help i think we can really kind of push the system to move this quicker

16902 :  and i think with mr

16903 :  but thats another subject

16904 :  ive been in prison for nineteen years now

16905 :  i thought i could get away with not paying some taxes

16906 :  first of all who are they

16907 :  and also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog

16908 :  i saw china embracing the world and vice versa

16909 :  i summoned my courage and poise and said yes but could you let me know what actually do you

16910 :  theyre not rich at all

16911 :  and for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment they figured out they have to work for thirty
16912 :  i was representing the shanghai expo

16913 :  so as susan boyle was saying that eighty thousand live audience sang together

16914 :  all are invited

16915 :  welcome to afrotopia

16916 :  and what is your power

16917 :  please tell me

16918 :  she multiplies herself

16919 :  or ultimately is technology the point

16920 :  are we meant to conform to technology

16921 :  this is moving very fast

16922 :  the brain provides us with the biological capacity to acquire speech

16923 :  it is capturing this dynamic variation in response to the environment and the

16924 :  we show it gertrude stein what we get back is gertrude stein

16925 :  so what weve done here is more or less a reverse turing test

16926 :  so that when we ask can a computer write poetry

16927 :  its just raw material

16928 :  but if youre feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer thats ok

16929 :  we show it william blake thats what it reflects back to us

16930 :  were also asking what does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category

16931 :  but we should also be asking ourselves what idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us

16932 :  so that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future we

16933 :  so youd be surprised to find that poem one was written by the very human poet

16934 :  can we build a creative computer

16935 :  can a computer write poetry

16936 :  i also believe that alan turing understood this and that when he devised his test back in

16937 :  there are other reasons why its perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before

16938 :  but what i really want to stress is by all means success yes

16939 :  most people make a strict correlation between how much time and if you like love not romantic love though that may be

16940 :  and that makes failure seem much more crushing

16941 :  but lets accept the strangeness of some of our ideas

16942 :  augustine in the city of god where he says its a sin to judge any man by his post

16943 :  and thats a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about

16944 :  everybodys wearing jeans everybodys the same

16945 :  and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally they own their success but they

16946 :  and yet theyre not

16947 :  in other words they have failed

16948 :  the dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery

16949 :  now is there any alternative to this

16950 :  its not the post that should count

16951 :  what is a snob

16952 :  augustine only god can really put everybody in their place hes going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and

16953 :  i dont think we are particularly materialistic

16954 :  its an escape from our own competition and our own dramas

16955 :  we need fathers as it were the exemplary father figures in society avoiding the two extremes

16956 :  theyve slept with the wrong person taken the wrong substance passed the wrong piece of legislation whatever it is and then are fit

16957 :  and so we tend to worship ourselves

16958 :  its perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living

16959 :  the problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school

16960 :  let me explain

16961 :  no ones quite listening hard enough but i very much believe its true

16962 :  most other societies have had right at their center the worship of something transcendent a god a spirit a natural force

16963 :  weve slightly lost the habit of doing that which is i think why were particularly drawn to nature

16964 :  we hear a lot of talk about work life balance

16965 :  when we think about failing in life when we think about failure one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of

16966 :  and they are described as losers

16967 :  he is not a loser though he has lost

16968 :  so im going to end it there

16969 :  not for the sake of our health though its often presented that way but because its an escape from the human anthill

16970 :  the problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top get to the top

16971 :  there are simply too many random factors accidents accidents of birth accidents of things dropping on peoples heads

16972 :  and its a beautiful idea

16973 :  you can make it

16974 :  snobbery is a global phenomenon we are a global organization this is a global phenomenon

16975 :  nowadays particularly in the united states if you meet someone at the bottom of society they may unkindly be described as a

16976 :  if you open the newspaper any day of the week its full of people whove messed up their lives

16977 :  its a beautiful idea

16978 :  there is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious about our careers about our status in the world today

16979 :  in other words hold your horses when youre coming to judge people

16980 :  and its again linked to something nice

16981 :  in other words your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved

16982 :  envy its a real taboo to mention envy but if theres one dominant emotion in modern society that is envy

16983 :  you cant have it all

16984 :  you dont necessarily know what someones true value is

16985 :  at the other end of the spectrum youve got tragedy and tragic art

16986 :  thats exhilarating if youre doing well and very crushing if youre not

16987 :  all she needed was permission to build three steps to her house from ground level making it easier for her to enter and

16988 :  what gives us the courage

16989 :  but as we envisioned it we had three key goals providing world class life support ambulance service

16990 :  if we could reduce the usage of paper towels one paper towel per person per

16991 :  twelve zodiac signs

16992 :  one approach he took was to analyze the result of memory experiments where people were asked to

16993 :  the same is true of people

16994 :  can you explain the astronomical observations that support that belief

16995 :  food is collected and stored the hive is protected from intruders genetic diversity is introduced

16996 :  now the point is decidedly not that people are stupid

16997 :  in that time there were seventyfive chief engineers responsible for the project and

16998 :  we all believe that the earth revolves around the sun

16999 :  it stands from fundamental principles that govern the way our minds work and the way we store knowledge

17000 :  how does it even form

17001 :  we all know its terrible for us right

17002 :  its natural to think about thinking as what happens between your ears but thats not where the magic

17003 :  if we really want to improve the way we grapple with these challenges we have to go deeper we have to understand what it

17004 :  this makes perfect sense they knew nothing about the rocks

17005 :  using the data he was able to estimate the rate at which we can acquire knowledge and also the rate

17006 :  your first instinct is to laugh at the flat earthers and assume they must be incredibly dense or crazy

17007 :  we live in the illusion that we have arrived at out own positions via a serious analysis and that we can

17008 :  unsurprisingly they said they had no clue

17009 :  he told one group of people that scientists had not yet explained why the rocks glow

17010 :  it was as if the scientists knowledge had been directly transmitted to them even though it was never described

17011 :  after all we all think its the most important thing in the world to know a lot and have great

17012 :  therefore when someone doesnt believe what we believe its obvious what the problem is

17013 :  of course we have to take positions on issues without knowing everything about them and if we

17014 :  then they attacked gay people

17015 :  dont shy away from phrases like moral obligation

17016 :  one of them was the skinniest human being so ive ever seen

17017 :  she explained in the back room on the dirt floor were seven children

17018 :  they were completely filthy and starving

17019 :  thats about the same population as the entire state of florida

17020 :  we get confirmation that indeed the gene is turned on for something like prozac in serotonergic

17021 :  so if youre in drug discovery for example you can go through an entire listing of what the genome

17022 :  we can see this unique fingerprint

17023 :  its time for us to begin identifying celebrating and building on the strengths that people

17024 :  whats your vision for your village

17025 :  more than an organization project potential is a mind set

17026 :  you wouldnt get it anyway

17027 :  we will probably give her handouts without seeking to involve her in the process

17028 :  and what do you want your legacy to be

17029 :  recently someone asked suhani whats your vision

17030 :  and why not

17031 :  the rats labeled as bright solved the maze much quicker than the rats labeled as dull

17032 :  we need to focus on potential in place of problems

17033 :  the stories we tell have profound effects on what we expect from people and therefore on how we interact with them

17034 :  create shared objectives instead of obstacles and empower dreams instead of furthering

17035 :  is actually called the vulva

17036 :  so that time was probably a little bit easier than the first but id like to try it again just twice more

17037 :  we sometimes mistakenly call the entire genital region the vagina but really this is

17038 :  so id like to try it again

17039 :  and heres the catch

17040 :  now what does that mean

17041 :  and how do you get the receptors

17042 :  he falls in love and a researcher walks up saying congratulations

17043 :  i said some may have a tipping point reaction

17044 :  this is what they discovered

17045 :  they tested their testosterone

17046 :  thats why were talking about this

17047 :  remember what she said

17048 :  the other way that we can think about affordability is in terms of our income

17049 :  we need to become aware about economics and we need to embrace it

17050 :  and the reason for this is that when we talk about a percentage value increase were talking about an

17051 :  so thats why the median is a really good indicator of central tendency

17052 :  only talking about percentages is very misleading

17053 :  so when we look at a downtown area at a place that has a hope of being walkable and mostly thats our downtowns in americas

17054 :  each one is comfortable to walk on

17055 :  thats really important

17056 :  how wide are they

17057 :  there are lots of small streets

17058 :  nothing interests us more than other people

17059 :  and lifespans increased immediately dramatically and we like to say the planners have been trying to repeat that

17060 :  we want signs of people

17061 :  if you do that you might think oh great

17062 :  we have to make this available for people

17063 :  they have digitized millions of books

17064 :  well let us just imagine if we can reduce disease burden on a global scale by just one
17065 :  and on the kuna islands cardiovascular diseases are almost non existent

17066 :  and as a nice bonus these guys also have a much lower incidence of cancer and heart disease

17067 :  sadly these very processes destroy much of cocoa curative properties and because of

17068 :  the only exception to this rule was if you were a human sacrifice a sacrifice to the gods

17069 :  thats probably an unhealthy dosage but it does indicates that cocoa is a relatively safe

17070 :  you had the honor of drinking your first and only cup of cocoa right before they killed you

17071 :  not a holy grail not some kind of breakthrough but just one
17072 :  ted is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock so theyre going to hate

17073 :  just another bald eagle

17074 :  so over christmas break at about four a

17075 :  but real action

17076 :  were in a sense a superorganism

17077 :  and the same applies to society

17078 :  jiler describes a place that is well known for gang violence and it reports of recidivism rate up of

17079 :  as we were driving away and i was playing with my new found toy we never gave a second thought to the garbage we

17080 :  well thats the second part of the story that i want to share with you

17081 :  we spent virtually no money to build this program

17082 :  and look at what weve accomplished

17083 :  pacholke bought us an air pump and taught us how to make liquid fertilizer from the castings

17084 :  so we set out to see what would it take to build a vermiculture program

17085 :  now you might ask that if there is still time before catastrophic harm materializes

17086 :  now it will take a global pack of lawyers and a lot of support for legal action from you

17087 :  so we already know that theres much more warming coming that theres much more warming in the pipeline

17088 :  so with this challenge in minds we wanted to come up with new tools new approaches to help blind people

17089 :  so we asked esref to lie in the scanner and make a series of drawings for us

17090 :  in fact i asked esraf

17091 :  im not saying that you have to play a game every time you want to go somewhere but the preps the idea of using the sounds or

17092 :  i want to leave you with one last piece of information to this puzzle

17093 :  theres nothing that would suggest that this was done by a blind person

17094 :  this is completely hypothetical

17095 :  hes also feeling vibrations in his cane when tapping on the street to follow the sidewalk

17096 :  you use the information you gather from your sight to make adjustments gather information identify landmarks

17097 :  it turns out they can and they do it quite well

17098 :  now can you find your way around

17099 :  pierre villey was a french writer blind himself and he said

17100 :  so just like esref our blind painter who was using his visual brain to paint our gamers are using their

17101 :  play video games

17102 :  thats the important thing to keep in mind because remember

17103 :  but i do believe that if we continue to develop the right tools fundamentally change our mentality and

17104 :  if these monsters catch you they take the jewel and hide it somewhere else in the maze

17105 :  although certain countries started to implement performance based reimbursement anchored on a quality and

17106 :  a study by a us national newspaper estimated that in the united states

17107 :  four which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are

17108 :  to anyone considering nand2tetris its a tough journey but youll be profoundly changed

17109 :  so dan demonstrates the many self learners who take this

17110 :  but given what i now feel capable of doing i would certainly do it again

17111 :  or a mac which is shrouded by numerous layers of closed proprietary software

17112 :  and yet we dont tolerate mistakes and we worship grades

17113 :  they have a tremendous passion to learn

17114 :  i never worked harder on anything never been challenged to this degree

17115 :  we dont replace teachers by the way

17116 :  so id like to share with you a story about a self study self empowering computer science

17117 :  he did not run down shouting

17118 :  or is it merely presumptuous

17119 :  what is the experience that the child brings to school

17120 :  so is it possible that these high stakes tests are contributing to a

17121 :  bad child i told you not to jump from that table

17122 :  one child might respond to my broken arm

17123 :  we have a cascade of principals fearful of their jobs other administrators fearful

17124 :  a different child might respond to the same situation

17125 :  the becoming is the creative part of the brain

17126 :  i dont see my job as to punish them or forgive them but i do think they can have decent and meaningful lives

17127 :  they were inspired

17128 :  frogs butterflies endangered prairie plants

17129 :  everybody wanted to be part of this

17130 :  they were patient with me

17131 :  our strategy is not massive system change

17132 :  out of those conversations grew some new ideas and we started some small experiments

17133 :  staff were excited

17134 :  and theyre here for a reason

17135 :  they were making a contribution a difference one they thought was meaningful and important

17136 :  disturbances died down in the general population

17137 :  eventually i decided if i was going to end up in prison id better end up on the right side of the bars so i thought id check it out take a tour of

17138 :  officers were excited

17139 :  system change is difficult and slow and oftentimes it doesnt take you where you want to go

17140 :  so that was the question

17141 :  we trained the inmates on those same skills

17142 :  i was excited

17143 :  but then we started to realize that if any inmates needed programming it was these particular inmates

17144 :  now many things work against system change

17145 :  no one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet

17146 :  even eight men to a cell had a toilet

17147 :  i interacted with a lot of people who were not like me people who had different ideas and came from different backgrounds

17148 :  but prisons can do some things we never thought they could do

17149 :  to make it worse nobody was listening nobody cared

17150 :  ive never wanted to hurt anyone

17151 :  i expected the weekend to end in disaster and i averted my eyes a lot because i was certain that if i

17152 :  it appeared as though the world was out to get me

17153 :  but i was alone and i was drowning

17154 :  violence is never the answer

17155 :  i would never be accepted into any community

17156 :  really it was me against the world

17157 :  third graders were bullying my sister so i stood up for her

17158 :  peace talks accepted our position as inmates and acknowledged the hurt from our past

17159 :  trouble knew my name and where to find me

17160 :  what you trippin for

17161 :  seems like everyone had an opinion though so i spent most of my time locked down in segregation

17162 :  and the people who were supposed to be helping me were condemning me to hell even though they didnt know what had happened

17163 :  i honestly believe that this among many other programs really helped me to turn my life around

17164 :  i was always the new kid that everybody made fun of

17165 :  in two thousand and ten this womens prison rated as having the most violent infractions

17166 :  ironically when i lost the will to fight is when my whole world collapsed

17167 :  so i reverted to my old ways to keep from losing myself as i fell deeper into the pit

17168 :  i also grew up a poor kid

17169 :  have you seen this person before

17170 :  but i wonder

17171 :  unfortunately so are a lot of people

17172 :  now is the time that we need you the most

17173 :  my face became unrecognizable and looked like rotten mashed potatoes

17174 :  it held twenty inmates two inmate facilitators and three volunteers packed into a little nine
17175 :  my children were my only joy and i didnt have that anymore

17176 :  behind our tough masks were fighting for our lives and you wont reach us if you dont prove

17177 :  people who fight whose primary language is profanity

17178 :  to judge someone before one knows them makes the other person feel inferior unworthy of

17179 :  im not even there yet i mean sahara beck is hardly a household name

17180 :  im fortunate to be having more and more of these moments

17181 :  i step on the brake

17182 :  with cars its not impossible

17183 :  thats really hard

17184 :  why do we do this

17185 :  they can have a precise idea of where they are and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are

17186 :  i believe that

17187 :  one of the problems when you get too much chatter its hard to process all the packets so you have to prioritize

17188 :  this guy is stopping dead stop dead stop on the highway

17189 :  so if we just do more solar and wind wont it kind of all work itself out

17190 :  because natural gas is about half of the carbon intensity of coal and that would have resulted in a pretty significant

17191 :  what about fukushima

17192 :  youre supposed to shelter in place

17193 :  most of that reduction is just due to that

17194 :  thats even before you get to the question of storage

17195 :  those are really reasonable questions to ask

17196 :  what about all the nuclear waste

17197 :  one of the biggest challenges to this has come from somebody here in germany who is not a pro nuclear person at

17198 :  so the obvious response is well just put it all in batteries

17199 :  heres this really basic science it is right there on the website

17200 :  and while we were struggling with this problem around two thousand and five stewart brand came out and he

17201 :  ive always been a pacifist

17202 :  what about the weapons

17203 :  if i thought there was any chance more nuclear power would increase the chance of nuclear war id be against it

17204 :  this is chernobyl

17205 :  when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too and this idea already saved me once

17206 :  i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me

17207 :  and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape

17208 :  and i always have been

17209 :  arent you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you

17210 :  otherwise go bother somebody else today

17211 :  and i would imagine that a lot of you have too

17212 :  to you nonetheless

17213 :  arent you afraid that youre going to work your whole life at this craft and nothings ever going to come of it and youre going to die on a scrap

17214 :  but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it

17215 :  arent you afraid youre going to keep writing for your whole life and youre never again going to create a book that anybody

17216 :  which is great because we need that

17217 :  so lets fast forward a decade

17218 :  you are going to call on maybe one or two of them whoever you may notice

17219 :  and then they are going to have a chance to articulate their answer orally

17220 :  you guys probably all use an online calendar to help you get to physical

17221 :  so while im teaching classes nowadays my lms will notify me when there are new assignments i need to grade

17222 :  we are going yo use this thing called the online bulletin board for discussions that are going to go on

17223 :  and i was right

17224 :  i was sold and from grad school on i dedicated almost all my energy to

17225 :  finally because its online its preserved and students can use those historic discussions to

17226 :  so i created some new in class activities

17227 :  and i felt really bad about it

17228 :  up until that time id really thought about online education in terms of

17229 :  ive been doing this at the university for quite some time

17230 :  that is all

17231 :  i started off ok

17232 :  let me be the guinea pig and show you how its done right

17233 :  lawrence island in bering strait to record the stories and meanings behind the last generation of tattoo

17234 :  there are also tattoos that marked important rite of passage ceremonies and there were other tattoos that cured

17235 :  lawrence island in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven when i was a graduate student in the university of alaska at fairbanks and i journeyed

17236 :  we have great technicians whove worked out a lot of great techniques for further processing

17237 :  i blasted down there after the end of that lecture and introduced myself

17238 :  but a guest lecturer came near the end of my undergrad

17239 :  his name was bill cameron

17240 :  not distracted by unnecessary discussion or noises that arent related to the job

17241 :  i was ready to give up on my dream

17242 :  it was back in one thousand nine hundred and seventyfive
17243 :  he has broken his neck very high

17244 :  bill was giving a guest lecture and at the end of that lecture he said by the way im working with this young man

17245 :  i went back

17246 :  he became one of my real key mentors

17247 :  i got out of the car and i was running to the washroom

17248 :  how do you do that

17249 :  bill saw this passion in me

17250 :  brain computer interface isnt quite ready yet

17251 :  i think its the perspective a lot of employers and bosses have today because theres a lot of people with

17252 :  an easy to open door might actually catch on

17253 :  people with one hand will thank you

17254 :  most productive baker ive ever had

17255 :  that i wanted to work on innovation and technology for people with disability

17256 :  so we started our journey

17257 :  you just have to ask it to put the pieces together for you

17258 :  we remember things better when theyre attached to a picture

17259 :  putin has gone on to vow that he will protect the rights of russian speakers around the

17260 :  language is one of the most important tools created by human beings

17261 :  some other friends took us in

17262 :  so in my case being blessed by hardships made me look outside

17263 :  and slowly i realized that i was starting to live my life in that way not just to make my

17264 :  but life has a way of happening to you so when i finally wanted to go and study i was already in

17265 :  wherever our destiny takes us whether it is transhumanism where the body fuses with non

17266 :  no jobs are a subset of work

17267 :  he creates an environment where work is created and we go out there and seek the jobs that somebody

17268 :  some would say its food

17269 :  everyone was there

17270 :  first a grammar query

17271 :  i told sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said only three

17272 :  so he has learned to hold out

17273 :  generally if i think something is wrong i query it three times

17274 :  wouldnt it have been incredible if we could have detected ebola three months earlier when it first

17275 :  its located in durban in south africa

17276 :  remember it took three months to diagnose ebola

17277 :  the human consequences could be devastating

17278 :  its one of the poorest parts of south africa and its also the epicenter of the hiv pandemic

17279 :  people stop going to work

17280 :  in fact all races and all nations are susceptible

17281 :  this is a collage that somebody made on flickr and these were all just pictures that made her really happy that week

17282 :  and the truth is that the world is a lot bigger than that

17283 :  they make their own

17284 :  and that has really spread through the internet like wildfire

17285 :  they make their own lists

17286 :  and it s so tragic

17287 :  they are examples of a systemic problem

17288 :  so as my bank manager likes to remind me im downwardly mobile

17289 :  but copying behavior is also common in wild animals

17290 :  now our discovery points us towards better ways to sustainably manage coral reefs but it also shows

17291 :  and frankly my assumptions were wrong

17292 :  but by asking lauran questions it allowed us to use dialogue to get to a place of true understanding

17293 :  i could take the easy way out and just choose not to say anything to her and instead just kind of simmer in

17294 :  it is so easy to get emotionally fired up about issues that were passionate about and we can let our ego

17295 :  and youre right there were some terrible things that came out during the trump campaign so much so that i almost

17296 :  i didnt understand why lauran would choose to have them participate in that way and i assumed it wasnt a choice that the boys made for

17297 :  and somewhere along the line we decided we didnt want to have any topic be off limits for discussion even if

17298 :  we asked the kids to rate the projects

17299 :  so that they can continue our progress in the future

17300 :  well this is where my personal story starts

17301 :  so while these three hundred sounds like a big number its actually only one
17302 :  most teachers dont know how to code

17303 :  and encourages creativity

17304 :  and we asked each school to give us feedback at end of each project so we could refine them and make them

17305 :  each one creates a toy an animation or a game

17306 :  and theyll bring with them the knowledge that code literacy is an important skill

17307 :  and get on with it

17308 :  boring to one hundred
17309 :  its also a very very useful life skill

17310 :  we will have about twenty clubs by the end of the year

17311 :  unless we know this theres no way of understanding how the universe got from the big bang to now

17312 :  we dont have a theory that predicts it or that describes its behaviour to us

17313 :  its an experiment called lhcb and we work on this at the university of liverpool

17314 :  this detector makes it possible for us to isolate the samples of matter and antimatter that we need to

17315 :  we think that antimatter did play a very important part much earlier in the

17316 :  they dont differ by very much

17317 :  this is why its a big mystery in physics

17318 :  in a sense we are the leftovers of those last collisions

17319 :  it discovered the higgs boson a couple of years ago

17320 :  its a really big problem

17321 :  so if i have a quarter of a gram of normal matter meeting a quarter of a gram of

17322 :  we havent by any means looked at the full data set yet

17323 :  well weve made measurements of matter weve made measurements of antimatter and as ive said we dont have a theory that

17324 :  and i say at least because theyre so small we havent actually been able to measure their size

17325 :  and this is important because this enables us to look at the universe in a regime where we have never

17326 :  what is dark matter for instance

17327 :  how does gravity behave at very small scales

17328 :  and so far we havent seen anything untoward

17329 :  so the question still exists

17330 :  the opposite of mindful is mind empty

17331 :  but when youre mindful of whats happening in your body and externally and it can help maybe to take a moment to bring the

17332 :  because the brain actually isnt fully mature until around the age twentyfive
17333 :  how can i keep them when i die

17334 :  theyre going to mess it up

17335 :  if youre breaking up with someone take their number out of your phone or tell your friends

17336 :  does a bee have it

17337 :  after a certain amount of time enough tweets will cause something to trend

17338 :  carl sagan said that we are the cosmos way for to know itself

17339 :  you dont see with you eyes you perceive with you mind

17340 :  but wait a minute

17341 :  and theres perhaps no more stressful a situation than when youre confronted with a medical decision to make

17342 :  and so youre thinking yeah

17343 :  three hundred people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack stroke or other adverse event is prevented

17344 :  remember when youre under stress the brain releases cortisol

17345 :  for your passport a particular drawer

17346 :  and they include terrible things debilitating muscle and joint pain gastrointestinal distress

17347 :  my doctor wouldnt prescribe something to me if its not going to help

17348 :  you might change your mind in the heat of the moment but at least youre practiced with this kind of thinking

17349 :  these are things to talk about and think about now with your family and your loved ones

17350 :  for your reading glasses a particular table

17351 :  they include impotence erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence rectal tearing

17352 :  so in the home designate a spot for your keys a hook by the door maybe a decorative bowl

17353 :  and if youre lucky and youre one of the fifty percent who has these theyll only last for a year or two

17354 :  is this a kid that can sit for a nebulizer treatment

17355 :  the asteroids are rich in materials that we want

17356 :  i was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders

17357 :  and i want to make a time machine

17358 :  thank you very much

17359 :  it is still rough

17360 :  the nearest pharmacy is twenty km away

17361 :  with vaccines and medicines to treat hiv malaria tb

17362 :  labeling refugees as poison to our societies bound to only bring our lives harm

17363 :  i was a sophomore in high school fifteen years old at the time

17364 :  to be speaking about an issue that never strays far from mind

17365 :  just as the civilian opposition has been drowned out by the tyranny of the assad regime and the radical

17366 :  syria is currently in the midst of a conflict and genocide that has taken the lives of

17367 :  elon musk warns that its an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a

17368 :  i realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five

17369 :  textbooks state exams music and many more things to help provide independent living

17370 :  but im sure most of you can agree you didnt have much sense either at fourteen
17371 :  here at washington corrections center for women there are many programs that help women

17372 :  she went and took her initial testing also known as hell day

17373 :  im talking about coming to prison

17374 :  im just going to highlight four of these programs

17375 :  the trac program is a sixteen week course that trains and tests offenders in becoming carpenters

17376 :  trade related apprenticeship coaching program

17377 :  im not talking about the bad hair day

17378 :  when mary got out with the help of her employers here at wccw she released directly

17379 :  hopefully youll see past the metal detector you went through the razor wire you walked past and the green ids

17380 :  so it was brought to the washington state school for the blinds superintendent for angela to work at the school

17381 :  if half of our rovers or robots dont arrive well it will take a bit longer but you will still be able to

17382 :  but how are we going to build with it

17383 :  what do we do

17384 :  where are we going to get this material from

17385 :  users can reach suitable blood donors within a certain radius directly and send them

17386 :  and in this case a neighbor saw it

17387 :  we have to engage with the machinery of government

17388 :  so scott was speaking person to person

17389 :  its probably the smallest of the twentyone apps that the fellows wrote last year

17390 :  theyre using their hands

17391 :  and theres a generation out there thats grown up on the internet and they know that its not that hard to do things

17392 :  and thats nothing

17393 :  it connected those two people

17394 :  ive changed my mind

17395 :  every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well

17396 :  people were texting from their phones

17397 :  com within weeks of its being created it was the largest group

17398 :  if you want to have a conversation in this world you have it with one other person

17399 :  i mean real superpowers

17400 :  we need to be resourceful with our food we need to plan what we eat we need to make sure that ourselves were using the most out of what

17401 :  this came this morning from a michelin star restaurant

17402 :  we had to be clever about our food

17403 :  i mean to this day we still eat six
17404 :  our main aim is to eradicate food waste and feed hungry mouths

17405 :  and so they had a simple setup

17406 :  dont waste computer cycles

17407 :  they found that in every metropolitan area they would capture over twenty minutes a day of cleartext

17408 :  that has collapsed thats a profound cultural change

17409 :  we know that yes they do

17410 :  and this is what i want to talk about to you today

17411 :  and this went on for about four weeks during which the world and i and perhaps you too

17412 :  we are just hearing bombs drones f 16s

17413 :  ive been using it for a while and im used to it

17414 :  you know fifteen miles

17415 :  thats not an accurate description either

17416 :  or better yet come near where i live on el cajon blv

17417 :  nine books read per person a year

17418 :  at the bottom is colombia and mexico with two
17419 :  but i pushed myself

17420 :  they were nuts

17421 :  as i motioned in the direction i thought she should go saying there are no stores on this side of the street so your

17422 :  whos disabled now

17423 :  very recently a woman walked up to me frantic

17424 :  i felt very upset

17425 :  teenagers just dont tell their parents everything

17426 :  she received death threats on her cell phone after school

17427 :  ideally i didnt want to demonize them

17428 :  i did try and talk to any representatives of the mentor school district

17429 :  when she was going to be homeschooled she went to the mentor principal and she asked if im being homeschool can i still

17430 :  and her parents were getting desperate and they were not getting help from the school

17431 :  none of them wanted to talk to me

17432 :  i wanted to hear what they had to say about the bullying problem in their school

17433 :  in fact i dont believe its what happens anywhere

17434 :  there was also a very complex story that posited that i was a pedophile and i was running from state to

17435 :  i remember very well when columbine happened

17436 :  we started by inviting people to reenvision what it is they could bring to a team

17437 :  think about the people that you know and what they do on saturdays

17438 :  theyre artists carpenters chefs and athletes

17439 :  whats going to happen to these jobs when were no longer driving our cars or cooking our food or even diagnosing our own

17440 :  but i believe that if we start taking steps right now to change the nature of work we can not only create

17441 :  and the results of the program were amazing

17442 :  so my team and i designed a prototyping contest that invited anyone to build anything that they wanted

17443 :  but second we have accidentally made it so that millions of workers around the world have unbelievably

17444 :  and its not just blue collar jobs that are at risk

17445 :  so even the smartest highest paid people will be affected by this change

17446 :  all dead carcasses of animals are recycled by microbes

17447 :  there are ten thousand species of microbes in this little gram of soil

17448 :  we dont know that on a daily basis but you have more microbial cells than human

17449 :  you remove all the hardwood and sell it

17450 :  rape and abuse is also used as a useful plot twist in some of the most highly rated shows on

17451 :  apparently some would have us believe that there are degrees of rape

17452 :  blurred lines indeed

17453 :  so that is what she does

17454 :  everyone of those people talks to a few people

17455 :  today i am going to talk to you precisely about how our understanding of sexual violence against women

17456 :  he makes her a coffee but she is completely wiped out

17457 :  well i helped to administer large scaled trials comparing the effective talking

17458 :  it will become evident

17459 :  then at the other end of the journey it can be difficult to truly savour the attainment of your defined goals

17460 :  the problem well our goals arent specific its that its all too easy to convince ourselves that were getting

17461 :  and why should it

17462 :  so what did they do

17463 :  one of them is good

17464 :  one of them is bad

17465 :  does it feel right

17466 :  one the most difficult environments in which to survive

17467 :  when we look at the facts we see something different

17468 :  it is the argument of the heart

17469 :  so if we look at the system we need to see

17470 :  a ten minute walk took me an hour and a half

17471 :  i mean you talk about low priority right

17472 :  or fancy appliances

17473 :  just name your parental anxieties

17474 :  this is usually you solving a problem or a pain

17475 :  execution is the measurable result of the planning that youve had in place to solve somebodys pain or

17476 :  lets put it this way

17477 :  lets go back to what hemingway said about trusting someone as being the best way to trust them

17478 :  i used to have a lovely head of hair

17479 :  and like a lot of other folks at the time i was forced out of my job and into starting my first company

17480 :  so some of you maybe took those ideas and actually turned them into reality right away

17481 :  and i just thought

17482 :  and like i said i grew up in canada

17483 :  i felt like an impostor

17484 :  and i was asked to visualize coming across the finish line on a podium finish which i didnt even know what that meant

17485 :  so i knew i wanted to do something but i wasnt exactly sure what or how

17486 :  you may ask

17487 :  so thats what i did

17488 :  so i thought ok well here is an idea

17489 :  it is not sustainable

17490 :  and i became a master of escape

17491 :  and we need them to be healthy to survive

17492 :  gosh its gotta be a solution so what is that solution

17493 :  to create your own

17494 :  and that passion is water

17495 :  others of you maybe took those ideas and just put them on the shelf for a little while

17496 :  who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your five year old youre getting a divorce

17497 :  we need to stop ranking our hard against everyone elses hard to make us feel better or worse about our closets and just

17498 :  hard is hard

17499 :  so what other big ambitious goals ive been holding onto putting off until retirement that i

17500 :  its about those tiny little decisions you know like when you are sitting at your desk putting in just a little extra time

17501 :  why am i stopping at seven inches

17502 :  i would break it down into these tasks that i could achieve that would require me to focus for just

17503 :  you wrap these public structures with yarn

17504 :  thats not what its about

17505 :  and i went to berlin for a sixteen day intensive german course

17506 :  but the type of marginal improvements that im talking about are easily achievable by every single one of

17507 :  today with cloud computing its cheap and easy to build open databases for people

17508 :  please go do that

17509 :  we eventually found lists of all the healthcare facilities in all the countries but these lists were generated by

17510 :  at this moment i didnt know anything about sierra leone

17511 :  and we have to get our messaging in there

17512 :  a good one is in somalia

17513 :  thats where they recruit from

17514 :  shes going to give up university

17515 :  what were trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman

17516 :  but mistakes of the past are inevitable

17517 :  weve got to compete

17518 :  weve got to attack that brand in front of them

17519 :  maybe the rolling stones has a place in this

17520 :  thats where their consumers come from

17521 :  thats where they get their power and strength

17522 :  were all victims of terrorism

17523 :  so how are you going to respond to it

17524 :  theres two essential ways of doing that if we carry on this brand theme

17525 :  why was it effective

17526 :  weve got to show our values

17527 :  its human nature

17528 :  theres a war on piracy

17529 :  its not just our flesh and blood they want

17530 :  they are going to make mistakes

17531 :  we must foster innovation as ive said

17532 :  theyre not just going to be smart

17533 :  theres other examples

17534 :  so weve got to find a different mechanism and one of the best mechanisms ive ever come across is the victims of

17535 :  if anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy like a war on terrorism and beat it youre wrong

17536 :  that we could now use our cameras to measure

17537 :  this is our team

17538 :  so as scientists we started wondering what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny

17539 :  why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can in your own way

17540 :  you may be pleasantly surprised

17541 :  armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem and having managed to source over a

17542 :  i wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution

17543 :  our willpower and imagination are a guiding light enabling us to chart new paths and

17544 :  so i decided id better get to know some people working within the field

17545 :  this means the loss of beaches and the loss of lands and this land being lost is lost in pirambu

17546 :  there are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance and its not as simple as transferring one gene

17547 :  im from pittsburgh pennsylvania

17548 :  i was born and raised in philadelphia p

17549 :  and this is probably the game changer

17550 :  and everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young mainly secular

17551 :  how long was mubarak in power

17552 :  humor is such a powerful game changer and of course it was very big in poland

17553 :  but here is also the bad news

17554 :  so whats new in it

17555 :  so i would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be a

17556 :  now at the end nonviolent discipline

17557 :  and can you look at the age of the people on the streets of europe

17558 :  you have the fear high you have status quo

17559 :  but what if we organized the spraying of graffiti throughout the night all over krakow

17560 :  well people power has been there for a while

17561 :  now what do the statistics have

17562 :  of course you could bet they did the most stupid thing

17563 :  and you can always use humor

17564 :  its only two hundred of us in this room

17565 :  i do it when i play obviously

17566 :  im not really thinking about composition im only thinking about arranging

17567 :  and that encouragement led me to share those duets with my classmates and they encouraged

17568 :  we need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective

17569 :  but i dont care about that governments dont care

17570 :  we stockpile them for emergencies on the understanding theyll reduce the number of complications which means pneumonia and death

17571 :  again not an insane dose not an illegal dose but very much at the high end of normal

17572 :  thats an outrageous and ridiculous finding but its true

17573 :  i read the trials on this

17574 :  and you can get licensed to bring your drug to market with only data showing that its better than nothing which is useless for a doctor

17575 :  this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution

17576 :  so people set about doing trials of the new drugs against the old drugs

17577 :  the cochrane groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that

17578 :  the infectious diseases cochrane group which are based in italy has been trying to get the full data in a usable

17579 :  and they need to have access to all of the trial data

17580 :  his trademark is a stripe its an eightyseven mil stripe that he uses

17581 :  and the reason is that we wanted this to be a really important station within the west end because from here rather than

17582 :  so to go to covent garden you got the colourful ones

17583 :  four million it is as big as it has ever been

17584 :  what we have to keep in mind is to imagine this great life

17585 :  as you see knowing your values guides you to make choices in your life

17586 :  you can take some notes

17587 :  ill give you an example

17588 :  and if necessary shed your racist skin

17589 :  truth telling according to michael ignatieff narrows the range of permissible lies

17590 :  i would add to that that by narrowing the range of permissible lies the ground is paved for an honest acknowledgment

17591 :  the color of their skin

17592 :  so theres a risk that as the range of plants change and as the range of bees change we could be

17593 :  last year in fact had one of the highest rates of colony loss in recorded history with

17594 :  we dont know that this is going to have a negative impact on bees but were looking into it

17595 :  some food crops such as the almond crop in northern california is

17596 :  this is a huge economic impact

17597 :  so what are they

17598 :  so honey bees are not at risk of extinction people love honey bees and they will continue to keep honeybees and expand their

17599 :  i hope that you have become more interested in bees in this time

17600 :  so if we can maintain those tree populations plant more were creating habitat for bees

17601 :  the honey industry itself is a big industry with one
17602 :  what can we do

17603 :  plants cant move theyre anchored into the ground

17604 :  we have a lot of trees in the area

17605 :  its possible for people to be in whitopia not for racist reasons though it

17606 :  we have the largest living coral atoll in the world

17607 :  people can make that individual choice to use a refillable bottle instead

17608 :  theyre quite extraordinary

17609 :  but the problem is these trades have meant that seahorses have become a

17610 :  switch to a refillable bottle

17611 :  this just goes to show that there is no formula to being a conservationist

17612 :  there wasnt even a degree on the topic when i was in university and now there are many but its still a tiny business

17613 :  and so theyre predominantly interested in psychology

17614 :  everybody else at the time of google more or less was trying to be a portal

17615 :  its probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a dvd player

17616 :  if at the same time youd gone and asked people what percentage of first class mail arrives the next day

17617 :  ayelet fishbach has written a paper about this

17618 :  what they dont say is well the numbers all seem to add up but before i present this idea ill show it to some really crazy people to

17619 :  its not an unreasonable thing to do its an economically efficient thing to do

17620 :  so we walk out of the shops with one of each

17621 :  they decided this wasnt good enough and they wanted to get it up to ninetynine
17622 :  the only thing they didnt expect is theyre uniting europe through a shared mild hatred of the french and germans

17623 :  its an innate thing called goal dilution

17624 :  i think the danger we have in todays world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior

17625 :  what we have is exactly the same thing the same activity but one of them makes you feel great and the

17626 :  in china not really understanding the principle behind this they applied the same principle to green traffic lights

17627 :  lets see by a show of hands

17628 :  its not the ritz carlton

17629 :  they will provide the funds

17630 :  in dallas texas they have a program that offers eight year olds two dollars for each book they

17631 :  and lets say its a foundation

17632 :  theyve tried this actually

17633 :  but for the problems we face in africa when we are looking at the marshall plan to revitalize war torn europe it

17634 :  the pan african opportunities outweigh the challenges and thats why were expanding stawis markets from

17635 :  traditional prescriptions for growth in africa are not working very well

17636 :  i try to share this everywhere i go

17637 :  i discovered that theres a movement for a better way

17638 :  i want you to know that me my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips

17639 :  this is what i found out

17640 :  and you bury it somewhere in that bathtub

17641 :  somebody has to win right

17642 :  thats really scary

17643 :  but so what

17644 :  i woke up in intensive care and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that

17645 :  they took out two of my broken ribs and they rebuilt my back l1

17646 :  youre in a wheelchair thats normal

17647 :  they rebuilt it

17648 :  and i practiced my walking as much as i could

17649 :  and little goals kept me going along the way

17650 :  that body is broken

17651 :  i had an awareness of being in my body but also being out of my body somewhere else watching from above

17652 :  they took an entire hour to stitch me up

17653 :  and there no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts our fears and our

17654 :  i had a neck brace and sand bags on either side of my head and i saw my world through a mirror that was suspended

17655 :  as we made our way up towards the spectacular blue mountains west of sydney it was the perfect

17656 :  she said thats nice dear

17657 :  i wanted my old life back

17658 :  in fact i lost about five liters of blood which is all someone my size would actually hold

17659 :  and then i thought why stop there

17660 :  i was worried

17661 :  i wanted my body back

17662 :  and i said what

17663 :  is that a problem

17664 :  i had no movement in my legs

17665 :  im a good teacher

17666 :  give them the feeling that they are ok

17667 :  we miss love

17668 :  i love nirvana

17669 :  but i have the feeling that there is some kind of love reduction going on

17670 :  keep on loving

17671 :  it doesnt have to be like that

17672 :  open your books

17673 :  put your hand on their shoulder and give love

17674 :  he had only had his pilots license for two years before he made that momentous flight

17675 :  at xprize we design and launch large scale audacious competitions

17676 :  and yet it happened didnt it

17677 :  you think this is just big grandiose talk

17678 :  i believe that you and i are capable of world change radical world change

17679 :  you guys dont think all this is possible right

17680 :  ive discovered how i show up and how i make a difference in other peoples lives

17681 :  it was in that moment that we realized we needed to be able to respond in an emergency

17682 :  the key to foot truck voting is the simplicity of the design

17683 :  were not the first ones to come up with a mobile polling place

17684 :  once the voter has their ballot voting is simple

17685 :  by going mobile we were able to make voting more available to more people in

17686 :  but before i do i just want to make sure no one is confused i am here to talk about ballots

17687 :  here we are in downtown boise

17688 :  but what weve done is simplify the design in a way that makes it affordable to implement

17689 :  so it doesnt matter where in the county we are or where in the county the voter is from we can

17690 :  this allow us to securely print each voters ballot and ensure they have the right contents

17691 :  its something we rolled out in the elections office here in ada county in idaho as part of early voting

17692 :  hence a mobile polling place

17693 :  it doesnt matter whether you are in an urban or rural environment food truck voting can

17694 :  well according to multiple studies by the u

17695 :  instead of having a ramp or a wheelchair lift by keeping voting out on the sidewalk underneath the

17696 :  but that was just days after wed set up on the side of the road in a small rural town and caught

17697 :  we shouldnt let our busy lives or inconvenience stand in our way

17698 :  so from there our emergency backup plan evolved into food truck voting

17699 :  low amounts low doses of toxic chemicals have the ability to interfere with the human body have the ability

17700 :  they should have had at least a definition

17701 :  you drink the whole bottle youll probably fall over

17702 :  let me explain a little bit more about that

17703 :  not one single study

17704 :  but you have its voice screaming in your head that youre fat that youre worthless you

17705 :  i refused to face what was being dealt to me

17706 :  i turned towards the control that anorexia that ed was giving me

17707 :  not at first of course but after my residential stay and going to live with my dad for a while i learned more and

17708 :  i took a semester off of school in two thousand and thirteen
17709 :  this will give me success in the pool

17710 :  psychological stress piled on anxiety crept in

17711 :  its this odd puzzle eating disorder are in that from the inside looking out you long for

17712 :  we dealt with our anxieties in very similar ways

17713 :  i admitted this was my life

17714 :  how was i supposed to see myself this image of a leader of a successful and worthy person if i could not

17715 :  no longer did i care about my hips my swimming academics my friends my health

17716 :  feelings and emotions fled back in and i had a choice

17717 :  one of my role models and source of inspiration bren brown once stated those words

17718 :  i could choose to let my ed take over to have my brain tell me to starve to run when i wasnt allowed to

17719 :  i admitted i had a problem

17720 :  weve the importance of the diaphragm

17721 :  but when you ask a maker to make a chest of drawers they dont always do what you think they are going to do

17722 :  he goes back to the assembly

17723 :  the last lesson is the big one

17724 :  you dont know anybody

17725 :  he builds himself an underground cellar

17726 :  maybe especially for women

17727 :  we live in a really visual culture

17728 :  he wanted to be an orator

17729 :  practice is the way to a great instrument

17730 :  the power of practice

17731 :  we spend a lot of time if you think about two worlds we spend a lot of time thinking about the outside

17732 :  suddenly i got it

17733 :  it tells you about practice

17734 :  within your body is something that is really the king of the body

17735 :  all song is our breath

17736 :  then he goes back

17737 :  its what the greeks called the center of all expression

17738 :  put your hands up if you thought about your diaphragm today

17739 :  i got how it should feel

17740 :  in fact she also read a poem that she had written when they first met

17741 :  the romans understood this

17742 :  my client is human

17743 :  finding of fact one

17744 :  when michael brown jr

17745 :  louis my entire life

17746 :  watson was in fact listening to very low frequency radio emissions caused by nature

17747 :  they will not vote for brexit or for trump or for marine le pen

17748 :  we need to enable people to feel in control of their time

17749 :  their parents or their communities used to have occupations and pride and

17750 :  thank you very much for listening

17751 :  what that means is were seeing the painful construction of a global market economy

17752 :  ill take you there

17753 :  i did the black guy thing

17754 :  how much better would our country be

17755 :  like i dont think this is going to work for me

17756 :  so go looking for your bias

17757 :  how much better would our lives be

17758 :  somebody stole my phone

17759 :  there are men who i have learned from there are men i continue to learn from and

17760 :  one is life without the possibility of parole and the other one is life with

17761 :  they also care about building green buildings because they know that it saves resources like electricity and

17762 :  one of the things people have been working on for decades is trying to reduce littering trying to get us to put our trash and our waste

17763 :  so stop trying to change it

17764 :  make your change meaningful

17765 :  you might be trying to improve health you might be trying to change the environment all of

17766 :  so framing loss can make a difference

17767 :  so some social scientists were thinking how do we get homeowners to reduce their energy consumption

17768 :  so dont change attitudes set behavioral expectations

17769 :  when people engage in the behaviors you want youll be able to measure the attitudes you expect

17770 :  whats wrong with a is that it sets the inadvertent norm the behavior that youre not

17771 :  thats the greatest predictor

17772 :  they sent auditors out to look at peoples homes

17773 :  what they really should be doing is bringing their friend with them and asking their friend to come by every five

17774 :  we can be successful

17775 :  so if we want to make an impact on climate change we need to think about buildings

17776 :  but you will be the least successful if you let common sense be your guide

17777 :  so thank you for letting me share it with you today

17778 :  anytime theres no action can you just walk by and drop something in

17779 :  i went to the university and i was taught exactly the other way around that is removing material

17780 :  so extremely difficult

17781 :  we need to qualify the material we need to qualify the process

17782 :  and they had to this with the tools and the materials they had on the spacecraft

17783 :  where else can we print with 3d printing

17784 :  its happening already

17785 :  but all of this is all happening

17786 :  why should i build on the space station

17787 :  and we need to educate people

17788 :  we have already 3d printed a one
17789 :  and now we have a technology that can enable this

17790 :  so let me give you an example

17791 :  avio stands for aviation and prep stands for preparation

17792 :  or as the acronym tells us its a pilot resilience enhancing program

17793 :  these men and women dont have time to choke or freeze

17794 :  i love to study these animals that break the rules because every time they break a rule they invent something new

17795 :  they break the rules

17796 :  youre going to desiccate out there

17797 :  and thinking about how we can encourage them to develop their ideas stay curious

17798 :  so here we are

17799 :  and i was upstairs

17800 :  theyve explored it in so many different ways

17801 :  the conversations were tough at first

17802 :  i was serious about my faith hoping to one day discover a tonic of spiritual disciplines that

17803 :  i was so excited to go

17804 :  or do you keep going

17805 :  we have to be prepared to go back through all our books and our films all our favorite things and say actually

17806 :  she was a secretary

17807 :  and i turn to caroline and shes crying her eyes out

17808 :  and it goes on

17809 :  lets make a change to all our institutions and not just in the west

17810 :  so the children have a plot

17811 :  and its that conviction that that we are taught that i think colors so much of whether were

17812 :  he says very specifically i wanted the world to understand that we should love and

17813 :  and caroline who had invested so much in e

17814 :  naipaul said two years ago i can read two paragraphs and know immediately if its written by a woman and i just stop

17815 :  my mother left school when she was fifteen
17816 :  thats what art is for

17817 :  lets write about it

17818 :  lets film it

17819 :  but all these years later weve made our mark

17820 :  i had to walk away and maintain my integrity walking away from big deals a lot of

17821 :  i was on tour across canada branching into the us and europe

17822 :  our video was everywhere

17823 :  our music was everywhere

17824 :  its called love inc

17825 :  i can tell you all to let your children go just as i have the same thoughts as you when i hear

17826 :  i played in the woods i built forts i caught frogs

17827 :  once the kids are led across the bridge no adult is allowed to follow

17828 :  well if youre me you procrastinate and you go on the internet

17829 :  good olive oil only comes from a certain region

17830 :  as each breakdown potentially exposes it to more and more oxygen

17831 :  some people falsely believe that olive oil only comes from a certain region

17832 :  it starts with the growing and the harvesting of olives and it involves everything it involves everything that happens to the

17833 :  olive oil grown in many places around the world

17834 :  now dont let all of this scare you away from olive oil

17835 :  but does have to commute like two hours per day and so also does not have that much more time to

17836 :  and thats not really a new science you just do a survey and you collect it maybe with an app

17837 :  keep in mind the exam is wednesday night ok

17838 :  it was a mess eraser marks everywhere stuff scratched out but five
17839 :  well take zero
17840 :  to enable its people to take that transformation first of all they invested in new tools

17841 :  they hadnt won a national championship since one thousand nine hundred and seventyfive
17842 :  but losing weight alone will not get you across the finish line with a winning time

17843 :  and second how do we fix it

17844 :  during games he would often ask what are you seeing that im missing

17845 :  most transformations have financial and operational goals

17846 :  that sounds exhausting

17847 :  it can be done

17848 :  im a very serious possibilist

17849 :  thats the first step

17850 :  it was crazy

17851 :  she was rescued out of this situation

17852 :  its just not fair

17853 :  are sold again

17854 :  we werent rich we werent poor

17855 :  you leave twenty francs on the table by announcing zero

17856 :  people are motivated by different values perhaps

17857 :  we strip away facts which are confusing in reality

17858 :  im not saying i have all these beautiful values right

17859 :  i do not yet know where these protected values really come from

17860 :  in other words this is a very economic motivation of trying to get people to be more honest

17861 :  how does that play out

17862 :  for every time that you announce that you had a tails throw you get paid five francs

17863 :  reality is so rich there is so much going on its almost impossible to know what drives peoples

17864 :  by the way im not a moral authority

17865 :  and on the other hand if you disregard it then there are higher chances of not getting your bonus or its being

17866 :  in other words it will pay off to put people first

17867 :  well it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values and in our research we look at

17868 :  it looks pretty similar for those who had studied economics or those who had studied

17869 :  this is not petty fraud

17870 :  selecting the right people with the right values may go a long way to saving a lot of trouble

17871 :  but i dont know yet how this develops over a lifetime

17872 :  but do think about selecting the right people rather than having people and then

17873 :  we look at the idea that people have so called protected values

17874 :  we only changed their behavior

17875 :  and theyve done it once

17876 :  so its not the straw that breaks the camels back

17877 :  like we talked about it

17878 :  you get mental images

17879 :  yeah its random disorganized

17880 :  i want to play a little piano for you

17881 :  i dont have the courage anymore

17882 :  i will not survive

17883 :  we will make it to sweden we will get married and we will have a future

17884 :  she wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger

17885 :  she wants to reunite with her family there

17886 :  around them there were corpses

17887 :  she never learned to swim

17888 :  why study ancient molecules

17889 :  they have the best food processing abilities ever

17890 :  but what about my own speciality

17891 :  how did it increase in complexity and what were the triggers for this

17892 :  i havent talked much about the us

17893 :  globally the us will still be the hegemon

17894 :  dont forget that americas rise was based in significant part on the

17895 :  they all agreed to one fact that is by two thousand and twentyfive china is not going to be a

17896 :  so i dont think this will be the future for china

17897 :  but after two thousand and ten the year when we all think china began to make some

17898 :  harold brown the former secretary of defense

17899 :  but i think in order to talk about the future of china we have to talk about the us

17900 :  a two thousand and seventeen poll by ucla of la county residents found that thirty percent

17901 :  and that doesnt include the undocumented because numbers for that population are at best complex estimates

17902 :  im a journalist and for the last few years ive been documenting the lives of us citizens whove lost people to

17903 :  they rallied behind him

17904 :  so ma was trying to explain something to me about grandma and when they grew up but i couldnt pay attention to her because i was

17905 :  some people are more intelligent

17906 :  here is the second one

17907 :  so heres the first one

17908 :  so as we wrestle with this question the lack of a comfortable answers propelling the development of animal rights law

17909 :  thats why another part of the problem is the laws focused on cruelty to animals

17910 :  so i thought what i would talk about is why thats the case and why its time to re evaluate our relationship with other animals

17911 :  i believe he is selling hope

17912 :  mohamed is not simply selling flowers

17913 :  often its youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates

17914 :  they had never really thought about starting up a business

17915 :  he eventually gets married

17916 :  but if you ask me the question today who are you amma

17917 :  and when people change then society has to as well

17918 :  and then i would be harangued

17919 :  think of how many institutions i can think of them right now

17920 :  it got to the point where at this junction that i was sitting at i didnt know which pathway to go

17921 :  what we realize about those women is that when they are able to break into that world they make an impact

17922 :  we have been doing this for x and x amount of years so we cant change it now its

17923 :  where are you from

17924 :  the question of who defines you

17925 :  i can tell you this

17926 :  its where logic is where language is where the reason what makes

17927 :  something that ill tell later

17928 :  well because we are afraid of failing

17929 :  the second tip is a little bit different

17930 :  you need to be sure

17931 :  how to create a flying machine

17932 :  a lot of people never talk in public but they know for sure that they arent good at it

17933 :  they are the neurons in charge of predicting the future

17934 :  and you know what

17935 :  that moment what it changed is that i could be wrong

17936 :  how can i be so sure about something

17937 :  have you ever wondered why people say we are the choices of our lives

17938 :  how is your exam

17939 :  to be sure about things

17940 :  so what can we do

17941 :  i was just a student

17942 :  because they used again the prefrontal cortex

17943 :  you can ask yourself how do i know that things are going to be wrong

17944 :  do a reality check

17945 :  why isnt it that easy

17946 :  i need to be sure about a lot of things

17947 :  very bad for him

17948 :  she doesnt like me

17949 :  and its not true

17950 :  you can choose what to decide

17951 :  thats the first thing

17952 :  and that moment in my life didnt change that

17953 :  and then you feel bad frustrated

17954 :  the future can change in any moment

17955 :  in that moment he had to use the prefrontal cortex and think

17956 :  but how does this work

17957 :  so well i kept running

17958 :  you feel bad but something worse happens

17959 :  and then we create in our brain a lot of dopamine so we feel good we

17960 :  how do we really make decisions

17961 :  but something magical happens in that moment

17962 :  is this real

17963 :  what is called

17964 :  but come on i know that you tried hard you studied a lot

17965 :  lets begin with the bad news

17966 :  you will say but they are not real

17967 :  you are not creating dopamine you are not creating serotonine

17968 :  and its in those spaces that we reclaim control of our lives

17969 :  and theres an infinite way that you can define your life

17970 :  theres actually two on that side two on this side

17971 :  we find what works and then we protect it we defend it against everything else

17972 :  and you know what

17973 :  of course well how do i do four
17974 :  most of all he was driven by the fear of diversity

17975 :  i didnt know what would happen to me after that

17976 :  the fear of the unknown

17977 :  i jumped straight out into the water

17978 :  i had no idea except to say please god this is way bigger than me

17979 :  it was a language issue

17980 :  im fine and you

17981 :  but it turns out it was the language

17982 :  life happens it happens all the time

17983 :  i know what language standards are

17984 :  it seems like an important thing

17985 :  we dont care about the national pride

17986 :  for me aviation english came at a junction where my background and

17987 :  in aviation it is scary when life happens

17988 :  so i decided i had to learn how to fly

17989 :  we speak the same language and we live in the same family

17990 :  and the baby pilot i am i see i am way too high i see the runway way over there

17991 :  and this is where were really lucky

17992 :  we knew how to build rockets

17993 :  theyre separated by distances that are around the size of a biomolecule

17994 :  i dont know whether or not this will be permanent

17995 :  this is really exciting

17996 :  when i was researching this experience i thought this is like a footnote in life right

17997 :  it was the fulfillment of literally a lifelong dream

17998 :  and sort of all seemed to be pointing in that one direction

17999 :  i pulled up a bunch of the emails ive been writing at that time i found the one i wrote to my agent when i finally had made the decision and said

18000 :  and i wanted to get in the mindset of what that felt like because i am an actor and i wanted to access those emotions

18001 :  because on one hand you know it was amazing

18002 :  i actually took professor chuns class when i was at yale

18003 :  and on the outside you know everything was going great

18004 :  please know that it is not impulsive but comes after many months of trying to figure out what to do with my life

18005 :  it is not a money issue a personnel or lack of know how

18006 :  what does that tell us

18007 :  we need to go deeper

18008 :  the answer is yes

18009 :  its the growth trajectory of the brain its the changes that are happening across

18010 :  what is autism

18011 :  if you think of them at a high level of activation in green and at a low level of activation in red

18012 :  this information is necessary for us to understand what is causing the disorder

18013 :  youre probably asking will my brain help

18014 :  i am an organ donor

18015 :  so how are we going to get there

18016 :  we do not have enough

18017 :  that is the only way were going to make progress

18018 :  when i talk to people about it the blank look they get on their face when they ask me what do you do

18019 :  this is why you need to care

18020 :  we dont want to think about it

18021 :  i came into this thinking oh my god

18022 :  i cant image anything worse

18023 :  his name was greyson

18024 :  you think nothing of checking that box at the dmv to say

18025 :  over the course of the akron art prize ive learned to get outside of my own head for a change and think about

18026 :  this is roughly present day irak

18027 :  okay i got lucky

18028 :  okay im a lucky guy i will enter the bar and find the best spot for that

18029 :  well remember that the luck is within your control

18030 :  buffett a guy next to him

18031 :  how about the investor

18032 :  thatd mean we had no money from marketing or pr

18033 :  her name was ellie

18034 :  when i picked up my daughter that afternoon she was visibly upset

18035 :  camp katrina was run by the humane society of louisiana and it was basically a hastily

18036 :  sometimes in very surprising ways

18037 :  i thought i had seen the world dish out some pretty nasty stuff to animals at that point but it paled in

18038 :  but where women do have a choice we need to respect that they will exercise that

18039 :  for many muslim women the hijab is an internal message to themselves and more

18040 :  of course we need to condemn the compulsory veiling of women wherever it

18041 :  the following day women didnt go to work

18042 :  and one hundred zero of them poured into the streets of tehran marching

18043 :  theyre going to be enthusiastic

18044 :  we tell very convincing stories we slightly shrug our shoulders

18045 :  we all chatter with our fingertips

18046 :  were essentially against lying

18047 :  now heres the deal

18048 :  he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language as its called qualifying language like that

18049 :  we cant believe how prevalent lying is

18050 :  this study powerfully demonstrates the unstable nature of language in sexual and reproductive health

18051 :  protest provides us one way to do that

18052 :  approach the world life with love

18053 :  and it was the same everywhere

18054 :  i was completely immersed in it

18055 :  and i thought that was jihad

18056 :  so i became involved in the jihad in afghanistan

18057 :  but now i began to question how i knew what i knew

18058 :  they can regain their hearts and restore them by filling them with human values that heal

18059 :  i wanted to protect the muslim afghan population against the soviet army

18060 :  the word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole

18061 :  and we got pretty far along

18062 :  and then have a workshop about it bring all the stakeholders into a room bring everybody that would be

18063 :  what we learned with the one hundred and eight million dollars was a way to make an economically and

18064 :  what are we doing for our energy

18065 :  we know the consequences of continuing to hunt and gather fossil sources of energy

18066 :  we have a good source place for water we have plenty of wastewater we can help you find a source of co2

18067 :  of course we use hydropower we use solar power we use nuclear power

18068 :  and by the way i dont mean to be biased and show just a man because in fact women were

18069 :  we can now get solar energy from germany and hydro energy from norway

18070 :  they give us great wealth but we can now have all of that but without the downside

18071 :  for one thing its very hard to know what you should be measuring or what you should be quantifying

18072 :  because for me equations and symbols arent just a thing

18073 :  so i hope that perhaps for just a couple of you a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have a

18074 :  but actually this is the opposite of what you should do if you want to be successful

18075 :  but some other people i

18076 :  now i always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person to

18077 :  gottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation and recorded well

18078 :  so those are my top three tips of how maths can help you with love and relationships

18079 :  now of course it takes a bit more than just a low negativity threshold and not

18080 :  but the way that people would vote would be very different

18081 :  where couples let things go and only brought things up if they really were a big deal

18082 :  but i also know that that doesnt mean that mathematics hasnt got something that it can offer us because

18083 :  so after six years my friends and colleagues urged me to publish so i published the first case of homosexual

18084 :  he called me from cambridge massachusetts

18085 :  that must be necrophilia

18086 :  what challenges would arise

18087 :  louis university in the u

18088 :  i worked with professor kevin scannell

18089 :  spell them phonetically

18090 :  grammar rules are relaxed

18091 :  well we took language processing tools that have been designed for use with grammatical well structured irish

18092 :  we wanted to find out just how irish is being used online

18093 :  and you start to engage with the other linguistic community speakers

18094 :  you can shorten words

18095 :  and what weve found is irish is behaving just like any other language online and any other language

18096 :  the spelling rules are relaxed

18097 :  its a version of irish thats more accessible to a broader range of speakers and in particular to

18098 :  so it shows up everywhere

18099 :  in fact you might even notice something today as a result of the last ten minutes weve spent together

18100 :  but the problem with this process which actually works well most of the time is that your brain is also not

18101 :  all of us male and female are unconsciously gender biased

18102 :  get curious and use it to fuel an exploration

18103 :  dont judge it engage with other people

18104 :  so lets take a look at the brain processes that drive by us how it shows up and most

18105 :  and we naively thought that our generation would be the one to make gender inequity a

18106 :  let me show you how simple this can be

18107 :  i believe we can teach kids about computer science and technology by having them do what they like to do best

18108 :  so kind of it was the wannabe writers dream right

18109 :  my goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash

18110 :  and it happens when theres a mismatch between the quality and the quantity of relationships that we have and

18111 :  thats someone who really sees us as part of the family

18112 :  and it was a topic of shame and no one really wanted to talk about it

18113 :  during my teenage years when i was most desperate samaritans became my lifeline

18114 :  and people generally ask me why

18115 :  the american invention is the crossword puzzle and this year we are celebrating the 100th

18116 :  who pops into your mind right now

18117 :  but i was like

18118 :  we decided fine thats enough

18119 :  oh im not good enough for any of that my teachers did though

18120 :  but i did decide that i want the top mark at my upper

18121 :  so even though i dont have talent you can get pretty far

18122 :  ok tomorrows the entrance exam well have to go and well sign up on the day

18123 :  so one of the goals i told you about was going to a top university

18124 :  youre never going to get into mit

18125 :  they told me

18126 :  so i was in the lift chit chatting to the mayor of frankfurt petra roth at the time

18127 :  it wasnt a particularly cool thing to do

18128 :  so what did i do

18129 :  well what am i going to lose from filling out this application

18130 :  dont be daunted by the fact that ive told you to choose the direction now it doesnt have to be your

18131 :  and so what ive just told you is that you can choose any direction it doesnt have to be your own

18132 :  because i believe that society doesnt work unless each and everyone of us are feeling

18133 :  the last ingredient that you need for deciding where you are going to go when having that impact are your own values

18134 :  but im also trying to save myself and do good things to myself

18135 :  at school they offered latin or maths

18136 :  what could you buy on this sum

18137 :  the old things are much better than the new ones

18138 :  but anyway you escaped

18139 :  im not speaking about all the stuff you know

18140 :  they are good at grassroots organization

18141 :  they have ideas that carry charisma and they have above all else the idea of islam which is a

18142 :  so democracy can adapt adjust and be moved from place to place lt br gt and can be made to be reconciled with different world

18143 :  now what happens usually between stage one lt br gt and stage two of a revolution

18144 :  by the way parenthetically it is obvious in the us case

18145 :  how can we connect this

18146 :  and what ended up happening he started a few conference calls

18147 :  are there other people that are doing this

18148 :  and i have these palpitations that are showing up

18149 :  i hope you will go out and make personal health happen for yourselves and for everyone

18150 :  its not something i was very happy about

18151 :  no the kurds will do better and iraq israel iran over time

18152 :  we produce all that right here in the united states

18153 :  lets go new york real estate

18154 :  but it is now weaker than it has been at any point since world war ii all of the crises the

18155 :  theyre there for a while

18156 :  you know how much turkey would love to have neighbors like that

18157 :  abe who is probably about to get a third term written in in the liberal democratic party in japan of course xi

18158 :  and thats what theyre actually doing

18159 :  we dont want to do that anymore

18160 :  thats what putin wanted to talk about

18161 :  i mean the turks would love to have only ten thousand syrian refugees

18162 :  does the entire middle east fall apart

18163 :  you dont like it lump it

18164 :  number two it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was

18165 :  there are real leaders across asia they have a lot of political stability

18166 :  asia actually looks a lot better

18167 :  we can still be that cheerleader on values

18168 :  through our cell phones individually we have those voices to compel them to change

18169 :  theres not a lot of mutual like or trust but its not as if the americans are telling him what

18170 :  those countries can fall off the map

18171 :  its not supposed to be that way

18172 :  they had been more opposed to the united states for decades

18173 :  it was ninety minutes long and they talked about syria

18174 :  lets send our kids to american universities

18175 :  we can still be the architect of global trade

18176 :  now look there are problems in asia

18177 :  we see it with the openness in cuba

18178 :  if we know we dont want to be the global cop anymore if we know were not going to be the architect of global trade

18179 :  we will see it in venezuela when maduro falls

18180 :  so youre really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across

18181 :  the russians are picking up the crumbs

18182 :  we want to emulate them

18183 :  you know our neighbors are awesome canada mexico and two big bodies of water

18184 :  we just accepted ten thousand syrian refugees and were complaining bitterly about it

18185 :  what do you mean

18186 :  i was peter pan and wendy

18187 :  and from up there on a smog free day you can see all the way to the angeles crest on one side and to the pacific ocean

18188 :  but though the crime was the catalyst it turns out not to be the main event of the book which like so many in this

18189 :  i chalked it up to her profession

18190 :  my head my whole self was always in a book

18191 :  the question is where does this urge come from

18192 :  honey what are you talking about

18193 :  and high stakes and romance

18194 :  vanessa redgrave was stumped in the moment

18195 :  she tells a whopper of a lie

18196 :  we love stories dont we

18197 :  we human beings woe is us we have this two pronged problem

18198 :  we who resolve to pay attention to each others stories and visions and

18199 :  its not that i dont appreciate the natural wonders of the world

18200 :  you cannot have one without the other

18201 :  its really up to you

18202 :  george lucas has said on multiple occasions that star wars draws a lot of its teachings from eastern

18203 :  even though we only see this briefly in the films we see that is the reason for his fall to the dark side

18204 :  it is attachment and love that brought about his downfall

18205 :  this taught me the lesson of being committed to the task at hand keeping the mind here and now

18206 :  would she quit and just walk off that damn stage

18207 :  drag queens are amazing role models for how to create confidence

18208 :  i should have been optimistic etc

18209 :  during the race everything came together

18210 :  you have to fire this guy

18211 :  when i was a child or when i get old

18212 :  so it has been one of the delights of my entire career

18213 :  ive always been fascinated by right and wrong

18214 :  we think theyve gotten the truth about justice wrong

18215 :  what should i decide to do

18216 :  i think a lot of our debates about politics are kind of like the debate about whether free speech protects hate

18217 :  ill suspend judgement

18218 :  people of good faith with comparable intelligence reasoning as hard as they can nevertheless come to

18219 :  you might mean

18220 :  theyre really good arguments on both sides

18221 :  a lot of the disagreements that we have in our democracies are disagreements about the best interpretation of a shared

18222 :  ive got an amazing job

18223 :  and just as we would not want others to give up on us had we been unlucky enough to have been born into

18224 :  we disagree about justice

18225 :  lets call the first the explanatory perspective

18226 :  morality they say is like ice cream

18227 :  theyre disagreements that people here probably have with one another

18228 :  i wont do anything

18229 :  so whats actually involved in taking each other seriously

18230 :  and unless we do a better job of doing this our politics isnt going to be as healthy or as

18231 :  only by shifting register into the argumentative perspective can anyone be convinced of anything

18232 :  we all want justice even if we disagree about what it might mean

18233 :  and even though we may and ought to disagree with them we shouldnt do it from a posture of arrogance

18234 :  we disagree about the role of religion in politics

18235 :  think of people who oppose increased immigration on the grounds that they think it burdens native workers economically

18236 :  and ive learned something really important

18237 :  every year when i teach free speech i talk about a famous supreme court case from the year

18238 :  when we ask ourselves what is it for a society or for a world to be just we give totally different

18239 :  that question is ambiguous

18240 :  the disagreements ive been thinking of today are disagreements that divide many democratic societies

18241 :  why should holocaust survivors have to put up with such hatred such an assault on their equal

18242 :  and the question the supreme court needed to answer was

18243 :  but the second perspective we can call it the argumentative perspective sees people as what philosophers call

18244 :  on the other hand how could the nazis invoke the ideal of freedom to justify the expression of a

18245 :  think about truck drivers who support conservative politicians and are then told theyve been brainwashed into doing that by

18246 :  democracy is so much more than voting

18247 :  people who are authors of their own thoughts who have the capacity to reflect on what is right and true

18248 :  you might mean one of two things

18249 :  but you might also think

18250 :  i think the main shift is that community work is more

18251 :  so one hundred years ago hormones had just been discovered and people hoped that hormone treatments were going to

18252 :  and the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again is orthodox believe not just for christians but also

18253 :  its just this

18254 :  and if you reach back into the dark corners of your memory you might remember something like

18255 :  and so it should be with us

18256 :  you dont need to be a great warrior like achilles or a great king or hero

18257 :  they were then asked again about their religious beliefs

18258 :  it can happen in different ways of course and usually comes in stages

18259 :  and its not just wildlife

18260 :  for my part id say its the most important project ive ever worked on

18261 :  id like to share with you some of the big ideas behind it and why it matters so much

18262 :  its like a movement

18263 :  vaporwave is more than an art form

18264 :  but anyway sunrise mall was used in the film as a filming location

18265 :  you should come and film it

18266 :  think about our kids

18267 :  we have goals for our kids

18268 :  the way that i do it in my life

18269 :  if youre focused on your goal youll never achieve it

18270 :  so how does this work

18271 :  if it doesnt tell me something good right now i know if i keep this up im going to get where im going

18272 :  its downtowns becoming ghost towns

18273 :  there isnt a single licensed architect in the whole county

18274 :  its the hollowing out of small towns

18275 :  but i think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human

18276 :  and its a story about a japanese american detective in los angeles in

18277 :  honestly what would you see

18278 :  silent when she spoke slowly to my friend and then walked arm in arm with him like a fashionable bracelet

18279 :  they are taking stealing so much of our time our love our

18280 :  but its ok my mom doesnt like curse words anyways

18281 :  the mission was to educate the fashion industry that modifications could be made to

18282 :  theres actually a professor in the uk by the name of karen j

18283 :  but thats exactly why oliver felt so isolated when he couldnt wear what he wanted to wear

18284 :  can you imagine the time and money she spent

18285 :  he was able to get dressed on his own he was able to go to the bathroom on his own those jeans

18286 :  but them i said oh please

18287 :  and so i did

18288 :  i thought we were kindred crazy hair spirits together

18289 :  clothing can be transformative

18290 :  i believed that i just needed to educate the industry of the

18291 :  theres nothing i havent seen before

18292 :  i knew that if i was going to make a change in the industry i had to use my background

18293 :  for special occasions he would wear proper pants

18294 :  magnets made our harvard freshman able to wear jeans on campus because he could dress

18295 :  and they accept more of boys than women

18296 :  also our society is more and more becoming a performance based society

18297 :  its a rather horrible debilitating disease and it looks a lot like the fusion of bones at the end of the

18298 :  it has fusion of vertebrae in that tail

18299 :  we also saw moments of disappointment on the podium when athletes had come so close to gold but

18300 :  and you never know your bronze might just be the gold that you were searching for

18301 :  i won stuff

18302 :  man did i love it

18303 :  and if you are im here to tell you that thats okay because even olympic athletes spend a lot of time out of first

18304 :  she went to college and she studied development and she got a job working in ngos after she

18305 :  literally tenured professors at ivy league universities would storm out of his lectures and say dont

18306 :  hes been profiled in the new york times hes been written up twice in esquire

18307 :  so when he decided to go back and get his doctorate in biomathematics he already

18308 :  eric actually didnt start out in biology

18309 :  hes a journalist

18310 :  but what this teaches us is that real innovation very rarely

18311 :  we can all understand and appreciate that

18312 :  some are governed by their heart their passion

18313 :  he got his masters degree in pure mathematics

18314 :  and thats important for a lot of people

18315 :  but it wasnt always that way

18316 :  isnt there any easier way

18317 :  bhutan for life gives us the time we need

18318 :  we are almost there

18319 :  we appreciate them exactly for the same qualities that make them

18320 :  and thats what we need to do so lets be positive and lets make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation weve

18321 :  csp produces a lot of waste heat

18322 :  and it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages

18323 :  thats exactly what the seawater greenhouse produces

18324 :  and when you think about nature often you think about it as being all about competition

18325 :  antoine de saint exupery once said if you want to build a flotilla of ships you dont sit around talking about carpentry

18326 :  and this is an important point

18327 :  and there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems

18328 :  for the vast majority of people suicide is when their inbuilt coping mechanisms are outweighed by their

18329 :  but as someone who works specifically in mens mental health im going to leave that conversation for someone

18330 :  and as i said at the start there are five guys out there today who are alive at this very second their hearts are

18331 :  when we talk about physical health we understand that at one end of the spectrum we have something as small and

18332 :  and again youd be forgiven for thinking that the results between men and women would be vastly different

18333 :  thats what we expected as well

18334 :  i mean apart from the fact that my alarm went off at five
18335 :  instead i want to talk about what each and every single one of us can do to help reduce the rate

18336 :  so if someone is going through a bit of a rough patch we need to take action and make sure that support is there

18337 :  and the same thing needs to happen with mental health

18338 :  we asked them to tell us what emotion they were feeling at any given point in time at what intensity that emotion

18339 :  but in order to do that we need to first understand a little bit of common context

18340 :  because we know from the data that if people are in environments where other people are sharing how theyre feeling the other

18341 :  this is backed up by a study that came out of the us by doctor richard seiden which studied five hundred and fifteen people

18342 :  i should also point out too that in terms of men potentially being more emotionally stunted there

18343 :  for each completed suicide there is then another twenty suicide attempts

18344 :  well actually no i dont need to laugh and mock them because it doesnt fit into this little box

18345 :  but i think theres also something else really major at play

18346 :  oh im off to broga you can say

18347 :  but whats interesting about these studies when you look at them closer is that these studies often about

18348 :  so number one

18349 :  look for and spread the story behind the story

18350 :  we have the power

18351 :  we have to change

18352 :  so i suggest to you

18353 :  and we must change that

18354 :  thank you all for being here

18355 :  theyre trying but they cant do it

18356 :  tap water less than a penny

18357 :  develop your point of view

18358 :  but i have always been strangely drawn to business and the power of business to spread ideas and as a platform for

18359 :  so for me it would be monster trucks guns and gardening ns

18360 :  so this is a picture of conventional thinking on left brain right brain which we now know is a lot

18361 :  corporate environments are amazing because they are bustling hubs of ideas and collaboration

18362 :  so the toy company i referenced at the beginning that i was working on when i got run over i ended going back to it and it

18363 :  when you have watchful eyes on you all the time it is very hard to to do that

18364 :  so what i like to do is i like to is to parcel out my time so i like to cluster my creative activities together

18365 :  and finally be resilient

18366 :  i wanted to do something meaningful

18367 :  but most of us doing it where artists and we actually lost control of the company to our board because we didnt

18368 :  so given that the corporate environment really activates the executive attention network

18369 :  this is the practice of really being able to emotionally detach from what you are working on which is so hard as a

18370 :  it is your job as a creative to put as many new things in front of you as possible and my favorite

18371 :  one is the executive attention network which allows you to focus on the task at hand problem solve its a

18372 :  number two is to create a safe space

18373 :  i find that during that intersection of dreaming and being awake i really get some of my most powerful

18374 :  we were eating fish for breakfast the customs were totally different and what that did is that it really slowed time down for

18375 :  my goal for all you creatives out there is that you get your point of view across in the strongest way possible and

18376 :  this allows me to activate most effectively and efficiently the network that is most appropriate for

18377 :  the tough thing about being a creative is youre really sensitive

18378 :  so thank you

18379 :  i wanted to do something on a big scale and i wanted to plug into a platform that was really powerful and

18380 :  a lot of these involve just for a minute focusing on your five

18381 :  so in summary my goal is that this message gets spread to as many aspiring creatives

18382 :  this is going to be the foundation and the soul of your creativity

18383 :  woody allen gets his best ideas in the shower

18384 :  one was that i was not going to let anyone elses definition of me define me and my

18385 :  i love that tip

18386 :  the next one is become a curious anthropologist

18387 :  i have definitely found that to be true but unfortunately i can never find a solid twenty
18388 :  so just find time and a space for solitude every day and it will really help feed you

18389 :  if you can speak from that language then it gives you permission to stray from that and talk from a language of

18390 :  a lot of studies have shown that getting in a more mindful meditative state really helps you access

18391 :  it was like things were reconnected in different ways in my brain

18392 :  my tip number two is i love journaling in the morning when i wake up

18393 :  recently i went to japan and what was incredible about that was not

18394 :  you loose credibility so it is really important

18395 :  these all sound really simple but when practiced they actually help you cultivate that

18396 :  learn the language of business

18397 :  it can visual you can walk outside look up at a tree and just really focus on that

18398 :  once at a festival a man asked me how i dared put a drum in between my legs

18399 :  in most of the ceremonies i noticed that most of the women and girls were not in sight

18400 :  mufasa says you have forgotten yourself therefore you have forgotten me

18401 :  why is that

18402 :  i heard somebody

18403 :  and we wonder why they cant think outside of it

18404 :  so lets do this im going to take a dog that comes from where i come from on st

18405 :  our young people live in a box

18406 :  the first e is environment

18407 :  well it might be some psychological issue but youre connecting yourself to the earth and the

18408 :  well yeah i think so

18409 :  light matters for function and therefore for health and water matters for

18410 :  so for example if this were a muscle cell the proteins would be in one

18411 :  but i want to be more specific

18412 :  and why do you feel good

18413 :  there are some substances that are known through the millenia to be good for health and

18414 :  i want to talk about

18415 :  so we undergo not just plants we undergo the first step in

18416 :  as it went off i took off and safely got to the other side

18417 :  things were going pretty well

18418 :  i knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and

18419 :  whats going on

18420 :  were incredibly excited about this discovery

18421 :  we cant tell where pain originates from

18422 :  oh sure if you have a broken bone thats probably where the pain is coming from

18423 :  here i am now a professor of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology

18424 :  but how long are we going to have that for

18425 :  so im elspeth penny

18426 :  it reminds me of home

18427 :  theyre not seen as foreign

18428 :  in that recipient animal

18429 :  because in fact the mhcs are identical

18430 :  until recently there was no reason to think that these animals were in any way threatened

18431 :  and now i know that i dont have to worry about that

18432 :  they could go actually underneath your desktop

18433 :  it runs the android operating system

18434 :  i think i heard somebody talk about that before

18435 :  and he actually came up with this concept of resonant energy transfer

18436 :  the wisdom of menopause

18437 :  the average lifespan of a u

18438 :  id written for my employer the atlantic monthly on a range of topics work money

18439 :  unlike males females can make babies and then stop making them but live several

18440 :  finally in these womens lives they had their own money their own places

18441 :  fast forward to one thousand nine hundred were in the u

18442 :  thank you for that

18443 :  its because for the first time a woman is telling it

18444 :  almost like they were discovering sex for the first time

18445 :  narrators maybe we didnt always come up with ourselves

18446 :  because from the ancient greeks on it was mostly men who wrote about it

18447 :  so the old narrative about menopause was that menopause is the change right

18448 :  its time for a change

18449 :  almost one in two

18450 :  but dont worry world

18451 :  and then i realized you know to truly celebrate menopause were going to have to challenge and

18452 :  are you reliable

18453 :  i think he doesnt like me

18454 :  i still love you

18455 :  it happens to everyone

18456 :  the son shows him the failing math grade and the father says uhh ouch wow

18457 :  let me start by defining what i mean by self esteem

18458 :  why is he acting this way

18459 :  people are thinking whats wrong with this kid

18460 :  we feel lousy we feel terrible about ourselves

18461 :  and while working with her i started to realize that self compassion offered a lot of benefits that

18462 :  and the whole student body would vote on where to have the party

18463 :  just like i am not going to tell you what language im going to be speaking

18464 :  most of the fingers that are drunk are dialing about it

18465 :  follow with me as i go through these letters

18466 :  a life without it

18467 :  most of the people that are in it are smiling about it

18468 :  everything that you feel is surreal about it

18469 :  and for the rest of our time im going to speak in one language that is native to

18470 :  so i ask you has that number that you had in your head at the beginning has that changed

18471 :  in the past ten years five million people have died due to a war in the east

18472 :  there are many health issues as well

18473 :  and for donor agencies unfortunately the audience tends to be people that arent even in the country

18474 :  and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like

18475 :  their marketing is slightly different

18476 :  they like the generics

18477 :  and by the way again for that group up there thats worried about whether or not this is going to

18478 :  germany has as many billionaires per capita as we do

18479 :  i travel around the state literally almost everyday

18480 :  so back to the training

18481 :  when were welcomed when were loved openly easily our trust grows off of that

18482 :  when we think about climate change we probably dont think about giant

18483 :  we think about pie charts and column graphs and endless politicians talking to scientists wearing

18484 :  thats the hard stuff that trees are made of

18485 :  it may not support the kind of life that wed recognize but it will support something

18486 :  so trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time and they get really big bigger and bigger and pepper

18487 :  and then i remember my high school chemistry teacher with really long socks at the blackboard drawing diagrams of

18488 :  then we respect

18489 :  how do i know who ted is

18490 :  even more exciting

18491 :  you must know about it

18492 :  i said but whos ted

18493 :  perhaps i have to work harder at finding a ritual which matters for me and going back into my past to see where

18494 :  perhaps part of this journey is about me trying to find out where i belonged

18495 :  and no no the ted group

18496 :  where am i from

18497 :  there are many different things

18498 :  surely it makes more sense to address that

18499 :  well there are many different things

18500 :  org thank you

18501 :  at the time that this crop was being

18502 :  and according to a usda report if we use native bees to supplement for some pollination efforts we can

18503 :  parking lots are an eyesore and a poor use of land in my opinion but just because they are

18504 :  californias almond crop alone spent two hundred and ninetyfour million in pollination services

18505 :  its actually gone up since the release of the document

18506 :  thats not what we mean when we say we want job creation

18507 :  not only is that number completely unsustainable but the previous year fortyone per cent

18508 :  and i spent about three years researching

18509 :  but this was easy right

18510 :  he had no understanding at that time what was going on

18511 :  now ricky like my father ricky was a very intelligent guy

18512 :  alcide was driving and he was drunk and he drove off the road and hit a telegraph pole

18513 :  its an easy step to start to get involved in this movement

18514 :  the first thing is to ask yourself what breaks your heart

18515 :  well how can i do that

18516 :  youll be transformed into a bigger version of yourself one that stretches backwards through

18517 :  at the end she says

18518 :  whats the easiest way in

18519 :  they both attended ball state teachers college in the late 1950s

18520 :  and yet we wouldnt begin to believe theyre all the same simply because they identify with that same label

18521 :  for five years

18522 :  i was recruited by the airforce academy and after four years went to penn state for my masters

18523 :  and its not uncommon to hear people say things like the colour of their skin shouldnt matter or i dont see gender

18524 :  and by opening those dialogues and talking about those experiences we allow ourselves to learn from the

18525 :  and i did that on an elite level competing for the u

18526 :  i grew up in upstate new york i went to private school for most of my life on financial aid before i transferred to

18527 :  as an exaggerated example nearly half of the world identifies as female

18528 :  but based on the twelve labels ive assigned to them you make a judgement about who they are you decide who they may be

18529 :  we see a lack of diversity causing issues like oscarssowhite

18530 :  and while we share a community with a number of people we share a subcommunity with fewer and fewer the

18531 :  i dabbled in a lot of sports in middle school before settling on fencing around 8th grade

18532 :  im human one of about seven billion of us on this planet right now

18533 :  but hearing him say that triggers a reaction in that caveman part of your brain thats trying to keep you safe and it made me

18534 :  because while some transgendered people choose to do one or all of these things none of them are a

18535 :  and to my knowledge i may be wrong im the only one who got that masters degree from penn state

18536 :  it affects all of us

18537 :  and these are our girls

18538 :  princesses in fairy tales had parents who loved and adored them

18539 :  we are so behind

18540 :  she appears to have some friends

18541 :  but normal is merely average

18542 :  so we were up on top of our bunk beds

18543 :  in fact weve found that every single business outcome improves

18544 :  the first thing i want to do is start with a graph

18545 :  and in my research and my teaching i found that these students no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the

18546 :  journaling about one positive experience youve had over the past twentyfour hours allows your brain to relive it

18547 :  and friday night were trying to decide between risky sex or happiness

18548 :  no human lands on all fours like that

18549 :  and if you have children youve seen this hundreds of times

18550 :  and we tailor the class towards the average

18551 :  and on one side of the bunk bed i had put out all of my g

18552 :  there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon but since my sister is not here with us today let

18553 :  and if we can change the lens not only can we change your happiness we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time

18554 :  did you see how you landed

18555 :  in the last three years ive traveled to fortyfive countries working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic

18556 :  joe soldiers and weaponry

18557 :  silence on the phone

18558 :  i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her

18559 :  your brain at positive is thirtyone more productive than your brain at negative neutral or stressed

18560 :  we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success

18561 :  and into the silence i said id be happy to speak at your school but thats not a wellness week thats a sickness week

18562 :  youve outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive

18563 :  you got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better one you got a good job now you have

18564 :  in just a two minute span of time done for twentyone days in a row we can actually rewire your brain allowing your

18565 :  exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters

18566 :  ive no idea what the discovery of a dark photon will mean beyond expanding our understanding of the universe

18567 :  one way is if the particles are super massive

18568 :  we dont know

18569 :  it is amazingly successful but it cannot be the complete picture of nature at its fundamental scales

18570 :  possibly probably not

18571 :  its dark because it interacts so slightly with our everyday electromagnetic world that its effectively been hidden from all

18572 :  it absolutely has to happen this is being planned

18573 :  is this what we said to each other

18574 :  you learned that plants could be used to help teach neuroscience and bring along the neurorevolution

18575 :  it gets most of its energy from the sun

18576 :  our nervous system evolved because it is electrical

18577 :  the coolest thing is that the plant can count

18578 :  its just trying to replace some nutrients in the ground with flies

18579 :  one of the reasons why could be that it scares away insects or it looks less appealing to herbivores

18580 :  yep that was it

18581 :  there wasnt exactly that big prize money to be won and the parties werent exactly big budget

18582 :  it was such a free means of self expression

18583 :  if they didnt have something that worked for them theyd just make it themselves

18584 :  and they were

18585 :  so with that description surely any one of us could be a hacker

18586 :  and so we need and were working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then

18587 :  thats the point of rehabilitation or education

18588 :  so these kinds of results really makes two main points

18589 :  that would be a little costly proposition

18590 :  when we measure them in the lab theyre really bad

18591 :  im not slagging them off

18592 :  its in everything

18593 :  she was overwhelmed with fatigue

18594 :  it is like returning to find your home burgled and ransacked

18595 :  can you help us

18596 :  we meet at the pub

18597 :  the most important thing is passion

18598 :  the two words come from the latin root pater which means father

18599 :  in zambia to this size

18600 :  and then we help them to go and find the knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed

18601 :  you can give somebody an idea

18602 :  you should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting african people

18603 :  what can you do

18604 :  but instead of asking them how come they were not lg

18605 :  can you look after the money

18606 :  this might be what

18607 :  the other method of extraction is whats called the in situ

18608 :  so they decided to call it oil sands

18609 :  thats not a bad size home

18610 :  well the wintering ground is also critical and it also is not protected and is potentially

18611 :  in fort chipewyan the eight hundred people there are finding toxins in the food chain this has been scientifically

18612 :  i did the math

18613 :  thank you so much

18614 :  now youve probably heard about the porcupine caribou herd in the context of its breeding ground in arctic national wildlife refuge

18615 :  teamwork is a very important element to project based learning

18616 :  all right moving on to the next one

18617 :  for a moment i want you as the audience to think on what this other topic could be

18618 :  what fun is that

18619 :  and because of all these interactive lessons ive almost come to love math

18620 :  i was one of those people

18621 :  im going to give you a little a few seconds to think about

18622 :  theres your proof that project based learning can make a difference if we just make this one

18623 :  adults have to go through this they have to collaborate and think outside the box

18624 :  but now that ive been introduced to project based learning i found math a lot of fun

18625 :  but some of you at this time some of you might be thinking well whats the point of all this

18626 :  lets take math for example a lot of people dont like math even though some love it

18627 :  when we get older were going to have to face the struggle that is working with others

18628 :  its actually a tremendously sustainable solution it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months

18629 :  and so even though were doing less per fish to bring it to the market were still

18630 :  i want to do a hula burger and theres going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun

18631 :  world war ii was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish

18632 :  every time i do a new story somebody tells me we can do all that

18633 :  this exists kind of on paper

18634 :  well thats only half the story

18635 :  this is the way weve been fishing the oceans over the last fifty years

18636 :  and then the next week when they run up to me again and go like

18637 :  and out of my mothers curiosity she went throughout my birth records and to her dismay she found out that i was a

18638 :  how simple is that

18639 :  and its also the same god that looks after me in every aspect of my life

18640 :  so lets start over

18641 :  my father passed out and he was dragged out in a wheelchair and he was crying out in the lobby

18642 :  im ok with saying no to things im ok with saying yes to things and im ok with being able to

18643 :  gandhi knew exactly what he was talking about when he said that

18644 :  take another example i was walking around in one of our villages in india

18645 :  i have made my closet my ally

18646 :  a world where i dont need a costume in order to fit in

18647 :  the love and acceptance that i would get being on a stage were real

18648 :  and on one hand thats really distressing

18649 :  and im really interested to see what will happen with art museums in the twenty first century

18650 :  they are housed in these intellectual spaces and in these incredible architectural buildings

18651 :  and i know youre probably sitting there thinking dana you just told me that people arent going to art museums so whats up

18652 :  and whats up is technology

18653 :  and ive thought a lot about the reasons that people love to go to art museums

18654 :  and i remember his soft skin and his hair and his red cloak

18655 :  and it basically said that participation in the arts is down dramatically over the last

18656 :  they represent experiences that most of us can only dream of

18657 :  but the social part of not being with anybody is not something people want to overcome

18658 :  there are people who have said that even though they arent going to these kinds of cultural things they would otherwise like

18659 :  and now ive spent twenty years working in art museums creating opportunities for people to engage with one

18660 :  the nea study that i initially told you about actually said that the main reason people go to

18661 :  is it the people that you were with

18662 :  people are interfacing with technology

18663 :  but for now open your eyes

18664 :  and they are engaging with culture in a way that makes the most sense to them in terms of time in terms of space in terms of

18665 :  they are downloading podcasts

18666 :  they are pulling up google art

18667 :  but on the other hand we kind of know why

18668 :  does she not learn from them

18669 :  we create financial markets that are super complex

18670 :  because its yours now you can buy whatever you want

18671 :  we create mortgage terms that we cant actually deal with

18672 :  dont worry im not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes

18673 :  well the so what

18674 :  the question is is this anything like human money

18675 :  that looks disgusting to me

18676 :  it was camus who once said that man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is

18677 :  when we get negative feedback we still the next time were face with a certain context tend to make the same errors

18678 :  so whats going on

18679 :  does she make the same mistakes as us

18680 :  you cant just shut that off

18681 :  what if we put holly into the same context as humans

18682 :  so thats just what we did

18683 :  theyre why people in the housing market refused to sell their house because they dont want to sell at a loss

18684 :  and heres the rub

18685 :  what im most curious about is how is a species thats as smart as we are

18686 :  the monkeys would rip off the tokens at every available opportunity from each other often from us you know things we didnt

18687 :  because you know its great for us but bad for humans

18688 :  maybe we should see how they do with losses

18689 :  the errors we make are actually predictable

18690 :  donate it take it and so on

18691 :  you know maybe its not just humans at the right side of this chain thats duncey

18692 :  question is do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do

18693 :  and so we ran a second version of this

18694 :  you really have to do work to figure out well one options a thousand two thousand one is one thousand five hundred
18695 :  and what wed really thought wed done is like wed actually introduced something that at least for the monkeys and us works like a real

18696 :  can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do

18697 :  you know where are we actually going to start with this

18698 :  theyre why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer because theyre evaluating them in relative terms

18699 :  im going to go with that

18700 :  they actually tend to go a little risky

18701 :  shes a really smart student english lit program honors you know the type

18702 :  this one thursday afternoon i was walking across campus with my boyfriend and we were debating back and forth about what i should

18703 :  meanwhile my teacher miss chambers the lady who taught me poetry and how to country two

18704 :  in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive on a family vacation i went to visit this place for the first time

18705 :  she walks over to me very slow and sulky like shes late for school for the last time

18706 :  what is your favorite part of nature

18707 :  do you love the oceans

18708 :  the very next year this woman my grandmother didnt wake up out of her sleep in virginia beach

18709 :  she said well its this period in time when people with skin color like yours had to do things against their will

18710 :  she said what jovan

18711 :  answer the question

18712 :  she said what

18713 :  kate deputy stepped up and talked about the dutch royalty in her family

18714 :  for the next forty minutes i sat in the back of class while the rest of my classmates found their eureka

18715 :  do you love the rivers

18716 :  im so thankful for my grandmother and the lessons that she dawned upon me

18717 :  so i started to wonder how many people did this woman set free

18718 :  the very next day at school we had our presentations

18719 :  i said grandma i love the mountains

18720 :  and every bit of black boy buoyancy came storming back into my chest

18721 :  i was taught this by my grandmother marilee roberts mays

18722 :  she said first of all you cant be throwing your backpack at your father like that

18723 :  how many doors did you leave open

18724 :  for this we use so called brain scanners

18725 :  we cant tell this from the surface of the body from the body language or from face we somehow need to

18726 :  all we need to do is to find the rosetta stone for the brain right

18727 :  what do you think this means

18728 :  do we have to go and dig in north africa or southeast asia

18729 :  its a very similar problem

18730 :  but this says its quite different

18731 :  what is she hearing

18732 :  but you could say if someones in a brain scanner looking at an image i just have to look at the image theyre looking at and ill know what

18733 :  but what is she surprised about

18734 :  we try to understand what the thoughts are a person has

18735 :  id like you to think one of your secrets

18736 :  does that mean now you open to manipulation

18737 :  so how can we read these out

18738 :  but what does it mean

18739 :  for example potential lie detectors or brain marketing lots of people are interested in

18740 :  but you could say this is still rather academic

18741 :  ill explain to you why

18742 :  so we cant train our machine on one person and use it for another person

18743 :  what could that be

18744 :  what is she looking at

18745 :  its because people stumbled on the translation

18746 :  it doesnt work that well on the second person

18747 :  so thats what we do

18748 :  what does this mean

18749 :  on the right are the corresponding patterns of the brain activity

18750 :  where is it

18751 :  lets look for something even more interesting

18752 :  how do i know this

18753 :  like the brain image you cant know

18754 :  how does this work in detail

18755 :  but how do you know this

18756 :  this now makes the task very simple

18757 :  it doesnt say on there this person is thinking about the brandenburg gate or something like that

18758 :  now there are a number of technical issues ensuing from this

18759 :  this works incredibly well as well

18760 :  is that how we measure the brain activity patterns for all these thoughts they might have

18761 :  where do we have to go and dig

18762 :  where is the rosetta stone for the brain going to be

18763 :  our choices matter if we prioritize the well being of people then we can make a lot more

18764 :  how rich are we going to be in two thousand and thirty
18765 :  one percent average global economic growth over the next fifteen years which means that in

18766 :  and now we can use this information to start building our forecast

18767 :  this year global poverty is going to fall to twelve percent

18768 :  because the social progress index also has some very good news

18769 :  and its not going to be rich countries scoring straight as

18770 :  well the social progress index can help us calculate this because as you might have noticed there are no economic

18771 :  and we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable tracking their progress all the way through the next fifteen
18772 :  in the next decade

18773 :  lets demand a different path

18774 :  plastics offer about once or twice of recycling whether its a bottle whether its a chair whatever it is if

18775 :  why is that interesting

18776 :  turns out theres a company called land detector thats actually working in china and also soon in south africa thats able

18777 :  and what you can do then is the milk or the bacteria produce in much larger volumes and then

18778 :  design in the ability for it to be taken apart

18779 :  its the water bottle

18780 :  while they were there they toured an orphanage and astrid felt a strong connection to the children

18781 :  and while its not our custom in these communities the families prepare the bodies for death

18782 :  so the people feel like they arent even able to say goodbye

18783 :  well this web of shared interests have allowed people all over the world to come together around

18784 :  he had lived in africa for a while

18785 :  the african disease had come to us

18786 :  you just put them in quarantine and offer supportive care

18787 :  were both about the same age

18788 :  yet i see her as a friend

18789 :  the hospital put out a press release about my case which led to more connections

18790 :  my outbreak began and ended with me

18791 :  it goes underground until it pops up again mysteriously to terrorize the next

18792 :  and some of them are going to be americans

18793 :  so why do i say astrid may be responsible for a scientific breakthrough

18794 :  he was now leading a study to try and find a vaccine for marburg and ebola

18795 :  astrids story is one of connections

18796 :  ebola was just a dry run

18797 :  marburg ebola sars theyre not going away no matter how scared they make us

18798 :  in fact just this week there was announcements about cases of bubonic plague in colorado

18799 :  we need to practice compassion

18800 :  this is a really important point for science because now we have a natural

18801 :  maybe some of you have received an email that says something like hi im a nigerian banker

18802 :  so now if your barometer is telling you that things just arent quite right that something is not quite

18803 :  what is your self worth

18804 :  and ut arlingtons native american languages lab was partner on that project and so we were very

18805 :  the story of the sea level change

18806 :  tremendous amounts of information is stored and encoded in language

18807 :  for example playing cards with the language allow the grandparents parents and

18808 :  tohono oodham community action is a non profit its engaged in the language and cultural

18809 :  we had her here on the ut arlington campus and were able to use technology to help create materials that can be

18810 :  when the cherokee were forced out of their traditional lands in the south east into what was then indian territory

18811 :  the oodham have some of the highest ibd rates in the world and reclaiming that cultural connection can

18812 :  its not just about language

18813 :  ceremonies traditional games its all about health and life ways and finding that wholeness

18814 :  in the home for child rearing where parents and grandparents and children engage in daily

18815 :  the human spirit craves that connection to ancestors but the human spirit also has great

18816 :  you can check them out

18817 :  so now i want to talk about the science

18818 :  i pulled off its bag

18819 :  i went to my first bag with the birch

18820 :  i ran my geiger counter over its leaves

18821 :  grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods and how my family was knit into

18822 :  if we look at that region in mammals that dont see so well such as bats and we find that

18823 :  its working its way slowly across the u

18824 :  by their attraction to wind farms

18825 :  so indeed we need them for our ecosystems to function properly

18826 :  were a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us

18827 :  so say for example the region of the genome that i was looking at was a region thats important for vision

18828 :  evolution acts as a sieve

18829 :  and the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right

18830 :  and hopefully in the next five years ill be giving you a tedtalk on that

18831 :  now as i said before bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly

18832 :  think of a mouse

18833 :  and so with flight its very metabolically costly

18834 :  but bats are very different

18835 :  they are worrying about it along with other things like how they are going to pay the bills how they are going to take care of their parents

18836 :  there is no baby panic

18837 :  but i dont have a plan

18838 :  in some places these are available

18839 :  im not sure how i feel about that

18840 :  it has to happen by thirtyfive
18841 :  it is still my way

18842 :  the women who are worried are the ones who really care about this topic

18843 :  women just really wanted to participate

18844 :  what they were thinking about it

18845 :  so of course when the time came i was on top of that

18846 :  it has to happen by thirty
18847 :  lots of women dont want to have kids

18848 :  and there are risks that your child might have a problem

18849 :  but then i look around then i think oh

18850 :  which it makes sense right

18851 :  and there shouldnt be

18852 :  we need to stop doing that

18853 :  and i am really excited to be talking to them about it

18854 :  that was the average age to have her first child

18855 :  which is a great thing

18856 :  having a baby without enough folic acid in my blood was bad

18857 :  im not even sure what a plan would look like

18858 :  it was my way

18859 :  do i want to risk my training the profitability i have the career i worked for to

18860 :  there is nobody saying

18861 :  in two thousand and eight the average age for a woman to have her first child was twentyfive
18862 :  and i know that i am not alone

18863 :  i did my research i made an appointment way ahead of time i read everything

18864 :  lots of women are waiting to have children or deciding not to have children

18865 :  also in one thousand nine hundred and seventy only one out of one hundred women had a baby past age

18866 :  i even almost have ph

18867 :  and here is what i found

18868 :  and that was different across the board

18869 :  and there are policies that work great for that

18870 :  and amid this complicated set of factors though we see in the media

18871 :  it ends where it begins from to complete itself

18872 :  its not just my work

18873 :  and its these three things immigrants votes voices and vantage points that i think can help

18874 :  young people i had worked with were being harassed not just by classmates but also by their

18875 :  two things happened as we coped with loss and recovery in new york city

18876 :  we have fought to be here

18877 :  and when people like lan are sitting at the policy table they can make a difference

18878 :  people who were members of my family young people i had worked with were experiencing

18879 :  so in two thousand when it was announced that the citizenship application fee was going to more than

18880 :  you can keep it to yourself

18881 :  ive tried looking at them and telling you how they work

18882 :  and try that again and do that for another generation

18883 :  writing down the dna was an interesting step

18884 :  so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a

18885 :  looking at this there was another professor called peter cohen in the netherlands who said maybe we shouldnt even call it addiction

18886 :  everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks i wish someone would just stop you

18887 :  crucially theyve got loads of friends

18888 :  but the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do a massive program of job creation for addicts

18889 :  thats how we think it works

18890 :  there are loads of people in this room you may not realize it youve taken quite a lot of heroin

18891 :  none of them ever overdose

18892 :  they can have loads of sex

18893 :  youve got work you love

18894 :  its because youve got bonds and connections that you want to be present for

18895 :  theyre really simple

18896 :  we shame them

18897 :  thats what we want as human beings

18898 :  so say you used to be a mechanic

18899 :  thats what i thought

18900 :  we give them criminal records

18901 :  it wont be your twitter followers who come to sit with you

18902 :  itll be fifteen years this year since that experiment began and the results are in

18903 :  we punish them

18904 :  i wanted to know how to help the people i love

18905 :  forget the drug war

18906 :  so i want to begin with an everyday story

18907 :  it took focus

18908 :  it might have been a breakthrough

18909 :  it took dedication

18910 :  no it wasnt

18911 :  he went on and on and calculated sixtyseven powers of two

18912 :  they keep going on forever

18913 :  i just politely raised my hand and when ms

18914 :  it was a tough decision

18915 :  i was torn between mathematics and media

18916 :  were not talking politics today

18917 :  there was a tweet adam have you seen the new largest prime number

18918 :  i was asked in an interview last year in my capacity as a lower case c celebrity in australia what was your

18919 :  my skill is not in the mathematics

18920 :  that fills me with almost sexual excitement

18921 :  so some of the suggestions we made as to what we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical and after a while someone made a

18922 :  it might have been a book i read the arts

18923 :  weve heard a lot about what they can and cant do

18924 :  to type it in its abbreviated form and then only about six lines of code is the test for

18925 :  weve heard a lot about robots in this ted

18926 :  it might have been a politician

18927 :  frank nelson cole did not stop there

18928 :  it might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done

18929 :  thats what is so exciting for me about this prime number

18930 :  and because youre sighted im giving you a red line indicating what intensity of light is being converted into

18931 :  exactly how long people cannot really tell

18932 :  it was a very strong transition for me in many ways

18933 :  but the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme

18934 :  yet information access is not the only area in astronomy where this is

18935 :  yet as astronomers we study a wider range of light and we depend

18936 :  we depend we rely on other methods in order to study this gamma ray light

18937 :  and i want you to hear what i heard

18938 :  but that was no end

18939 :  supernova explosions are very extreme

18940 :  when i lost my sight i noticed that i didnt have access to the same amount and quality of

18941 :  and beyond that we rely on other methods

18942 :  she transformed into a supernova and in the process releasing a tremendous amount of

18943 :  what happens to them if they develop a disability

18944 :  and just for your information the magnetic field of a magnetar is one thousand trillion times the

18945 :  information access empowers us to flourish

18946 :  older people have that experience

18947 :  and to make better use of their value

18948 :  it happens mainly under two conditions

18949 :  this subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book which compares traditional

18950 :  at the worst extreme many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four

18951 :  thank you very much

18952 :  you are not told about how we are learning to begin to waste less and consume less

18953 :  we worry about how you can get away from people

18954 :  you are not told about the population slowing down

18955 :  we worry about how many people there are

18956 :  in my country in government schools sometimes as low as twenty in some states actually have a specialist music teacher

18957 :  but of course im actually making a point

18958 :  so thats your musical material

18959 :  let me do it again if you like that

18960 :  employers tell us when we do the research that yes they want people who can read and write and

18961 :  why did i decide to come and talk about this

18962 :  some audience participation

18963 :  and so our brain loves patterns and patterns in sound are incredibly complex and sophisticated

18964 :  male leaders are strong powerful and decisive yet a woman in the same exact position is considered a bitch

18965 :  he was obsessed and would dress only in this outfit

18966 :  today he shudders with embarrassment whenever we bring up his close association to something so

18967 :  weve internalized these traits with a concrete male female association although the traits and qualities belonging to

18968 :  like everyone else i possess both masculine and feminine qualities

18969 :  we allow and even enforce a duality or double standard

18970 :  this social dominance of masculinity is known as hegemonic masculinity

18971 :  in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone psychologist monica biernat found that children do not initially see masculinity

18972 :  we slut shame girls while admiring a man who is a player

18973 :  now im a pretty typical fifteen year old girl i like fashion i spend too much time on my phone and i have seen

18974 :  i should have been happy ecstatic and so proud of my achievement yet i only felt panic

18975 :  what should i major in

18976 :  watsons actually huge

18977 :  they were exactly right

18978 :  i had taken some artificial intelligence classes

18979 :  so me and all my friends would run home every day and watch jeopardy

18980 :  theres so much information out there

18981 :  the advantage of volume first just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays

18982 :  i was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid

18983 :  who do i vote for

18984 :  i mean nine years is a long time

18985 :  ive met a lot of them

18986 :  but ive realized we dont need to

18987 :  it could very well be

18988 :  i had both a man and a woman ask me for a raise at the same time so i was confronted with my different reactions

18989 :  there is actually a huge network of it

18990 :  but time after time people would come up to me and ask hey can i eat this food

18991 :  well of course i wanted to say yes

18992 :  you grew it

18993 :  were talking about children at school who are too hungry to concentrate elders who are stuck at home with

18994 :  i was worried

18995 :  why is all this food being wasted

18996 :  and at every single one nearly every morsel of food was taken home at the end

18997 :  a very minuscule amount

18998 :  i believe where there is a will there is a way

18999 :  my next stop was lancaster pennsylvannia and i wasnt sure if i was going to be able to pull it off here its kind

19000 :  sell by dates suggested sell by dates best by dates expiration dates a lot of mystery around them

19001 :  so i decided to do some research

19002 :  suggested sell by date is a suggestion and best by date does not say bad after

19003 :  why did you make me do that

19004 :  but it can happen

19005 :  at that moment i knew i needed to get out

19006 :  enough was enough

19007 :  how i got here

19008 :  we get them an education

19009 :  it wasnt his child

19010 :  id never seen that fear before

19011 :  i wasnt going to hurt anyone

19012 :  its just about empowering and helping women

19013 :  look in the bathroom

19014 :  because i was being abused

19015 :  my daughter went through a long court case and we were one great united family

19016 :  who wouldve thought that could happen

19017 :  through this lens we witnessed the mistakes the changes of mind the naivetes young censored

19018 :  in that moment he became a scholar

19019 :  to make the first transcription of this manuscript in two hundred and fifty years

19020 :  these are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar a reader of texts into a

19021 :  that means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions

19022 :  the real number is likely double that

19023 :  and i realized a long time ago that if i challenge people to build the equipment they need out of the garbage

19024 :  six hundred more years before they fully exploited the new technology

19025 :  when is it going to be awesome like it ought to be

19026 :  all papyrus came from egypt

19027 :  these are linear processes and a roll of papyrus was great for capturing that

19028 :  for the first thousand years reading was something you did out loud

19029 :  the last time there was a revolution in it of similar magnitude was

19030 :  that means that i cant cure my abuse and that there will be no escaping it until i die

19031 :  and the other people said oh my god

19032 :  youre so resilient you survived

19033 :  you talked about that

19034 :  we cant say theyre not important they are important in our lives

19035 :  so origins are important

19036 :  i need to talk about the tricorder

19037 :  already you can start to see patterns

19038 :  they let me synthesize and visualize my learning

19039 :  and visual spatial people are really great at seeing the connections between things and the whole

19040 :  the only constant in life is really change

19041 :  dont do it alone

19042 :  five minutes to rotate those people a one hundred and eighty degrees until those blast doors those heavy doors

19043 :  once upon a time you probably remember when education and entertainment were actually location based right

19044 :  unlike this one and click click that content appears on screens all around the world just like that

19045 :  what is going on here

19046 :  that sums it up perfectly

19047 :  i love it i use it everyday

19048 :  i love video games

19049 :  so we take three
19050 :  ideas worth spreading

19051 :  i need a dozen buttons i need to dance around the room

19052 :  ive got a choice a and b not enough choices

19053 :  these are incredible things

19054 :  and that real life tragic event doesnt seem to have had any impact on peoples

19055 :  something you can teach in a sentence or less but which actual expertise at takes a lot

19056 :  i love movies

19057 :  and your next project whatever it might be my encouragement to you is in whatever industry you work

19058 :  im playing a game ive got to make a decision

19059 :  i love video games

19060 :  it applies to you too

19061 :  and that idea of microbravery

19062 :  research backs this idea of praising effort for nearly everything we do in our parenting not just in bravery

19063 :  all of this brings me around to the most important thing that i learned from the research from my own life and what i

19064 :  we get to parent them

19065 :  and that in general we dont do a very good job of fostering autonomy in girls which is a critical

19066 :  so when your kids are afraid of something small like going into that dark room to turn on the light or petting a friendly

19067 :  dont draw the way youre being told to draw

19068 :  you can go to holy name which is coed or st

19069 :  johns which is all boys

19070 :  i would send out hundreds of postcards to editors and art directors but they would go unanswered

19071 :  do you have a job yet

19072 :  he wanted me to go to a private school and he gave me an option

19073 :  so i loved writing so much that id come home from school and i would take out pieces of paper and i would staple them

19074 :  celebrate your own style

19075 :  and i loved that thought of being able to share my ideas through the printed page

19076 :  i would send out my books

19077 :  i set up a studio and i tried to get published

19078 :  and my grandfather he was a wise man and he saw that as a problem because he knew that was like the one thing i

19079 :  and then something happened that changed my life

19080 :  but i know its going to happen

19081 :  they each smoked two packs a day each nonfiltered and by the time i was six i could order a southern comfort

19082 :  and i thought oh no

19083 :  now i used to work the weekends at the hole in the wall off season programming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off

19084 :  and i received an email from an editor at random house with a subject line nice work

19085 :  i graduated from risd

19086 :  number one i dont have an indian accent i have a pakistani accent ok

19087 :  i was going to work on the second one next

19088 :  this is potentially such important work

19089 :  its a war on superbugs

19090 :  and of course we want to sterilize mostly when there are people around

19091 :  so lets talk about superbugs for a moment

19092 :  everywhere he looked was the sight of his family of his friends

19093 :  he wanted to quit everything

19094 :  once upon a time there was a little boy in a little place who loves loves to

19095 :  they deserve it

19096 :  well i mean thats not true but anyway

19097 :  well the ultimate reason of why im here today is not to lecture you about science or about

19098 :  we gave them our game as a training tool and we created a collaborative quest

19099 :  did you just feel it

19100 :  just think about all the people that you know that started a business and failed

19101 :  everyone has more

19102 :  we tend to think right that misery loves company that venting will help get rid of our negative emotions

19103 :  we can be more aware that bad tends to stick

19104 :  can people shift back and forth or do they get stuck in one way of thinking about it

19105 :  what is that sense of hopelessness

19106 :  i tried to think how do i respond to that hopelessness

19107 :  climate change is mine but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality

19108 :  theres nothing we can do

19109 :  you know there are lesters from every part of social society

19110 :  when will i get stopped

19111 :  but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial opression when im

19112 :  and yeah they pretty much retouch all the photos but that is only a small component of whats happening

19113 :  in my industry we call that a sexy girl

19114 :  you know you can be anything

19115 :  i am on this stage because i am a pretty white women

19116 :  well we have two objective measures

19117 :  you probably wouldnt do that

19118 :  these are well meaning doctors some of them have gone on to become very good friends

19119 :  id like to get that as quickly as possible

19120 :  we want this to be correct

19121 :  right i am failing mathematics so somebody should probably fix this quickly

19122 :  as example i have been told to stay in this circle because this is the best way all the cameras can capture my angle

19123 :  dont even try it

19124 :  it will be able to capture the minor details great

19125 :  and one of the most common things i keep on hearing and it goes over and over and over again is that we are clever

19126 :  and brians shoulders sank

19127 :  if there is one for me this is it to help this happen

19128 :  we see it at the d

19129 :  they were cured

19130 :  that transformation is amazing

19131 :  to which he reported most of them replied hell no

19132 :  protagoras said that objective truth was an illusion because man is the measure of all things

19133 :  but would it make it easier for you to know whats true

19134 :  i think its a human problem having to do with how we think and what we value

19135 :  our online life is personalized everything from the ads we read to the news that comes down our facebook

19136 :  the second thing can be summed up by the latin phrase that kant took as the motto for

19137 :  we agree that you cant flap your arms and fly

19138 :  i dont think that because i dont think at the end of the day it is a technological problem

19139 :  we already carry a world of information around in our pockets but it seems as if the more information we

19140 :  so they get it

19141 :  and i do mean east africa not just rwanda

19142 :  one thing that people i think often miss is that these kinds of leaps generate compounding gains

19143 :  over the next few years as we start serving private health care facilities well also use that mobile payment platform

19144 :  they ended up sending seven units of red blood cells four units of plasma and two units of platelets

19145 :  so we have to be able to decelerate the plane from about one hundred kilometers an hour to zero in half of a second

19146 :  thats what we have to change

19147 :  and not only that but our autonomous fleet of vehicles relies on that cellular network

19148 :  so i was asking earlier who is going to be creating the disruptive technology

19149 :  but blood is also challenging because it has a very short shelf life there are lots of different

19150 :  brimming with confidence

19151 :  these conversations are terribly fraught

19152 :  im going to quit my job

19153 :  i write about these conversations

19154 :  he can then wear a prosthetic and run and jump and play

19155 :  but his conversations with the patient were exactly what a patient might want

19156 :  im going to move in with my parents

19157 :  but we didnt learn about it from common cancers

19158 :  what will you tell them

19159 :  this is how science learns

19160 :  what that number actually represents is the most watched ted talk of all time because thats how many views sir ken

19161 :  now whats the problem a big problem with modern society is that we have the toy industries and the entertainment

19162 :  of course we should

19163 :  i read a paper recently about gaming

19164 :  now theres something else here because in our house what we do is we celebrate creativity

19165 :  what ive discovered from the research but not just what ive discovered from the research what were actually practicing in our home

19166 :  we put too much pressure on our kids in terms of university and entrance and all that stuff

19167 :  now what does that number represent

19168 :  and they construct stuff

19169 :  he spoke about education

19170 :  so what i want to share with you over the next ten minutes or so is what i have discovered

19171 :  when do we get that rush of oxytocin its when were in deeply loving affectionate relationships

19172 :  we should allow for those multi day play activities

19173 :  in the bookcase im a big fan of bansky the graffiti artist therere books about bansky

19174 :  but in particular what he focused on was the problem with education

19175 :  the answer is a hole

19176 :  i talked to hannah about the meaning of that art

19177 :  now theres something else important here and that is divergent thinking

19178 :  its also parents that kill creativity

19179 :  we plan everything for them and in fact what children need is unstructured time

19180 :  well youd die if you did that

19181 :  so ive been stuck

19182 :  spring off the thing and fly through the air and hopefully you make it look good

19183 :  theyre great for catching you up to certain heights

19184 :  your blood tries to boil

19185 :  if youre at one hundred thousand feet you die

19186 :  but it wasnt always that way

19187 :  the body swells up

19188 :  its things to do rather than how we often see flirting which is a

19189 :  sound familiar anyone

19190 :  so as part of my quest to help people become better flirts i did research

19191 :  but as you go down the arm towards the hands the touch gets more

19192 :  so when tides are at their peak stress or what we call the time of encouraging stress

19193 :  in this environment sound travels much more efficiently than light does as whales have learned

19194 :  are you good at it

19195 :  that means if you want to save lives you can do it in a different way

19196 :  and why is this important

19197 :  a good metaphor for this and actually something i was experiencing literally at the time is a symphony orchestra because

19198 :  and ive really fallen in line with this really well all my life

19199 :  i also wanted to build a body of knowledge around my project so that i could learn how to repair or even make some of the

19200 :  and for me this was overwhelming and depressing and paralyzing

19201 :  and its involved the transformation of my life from one characterized by

19202 :  then i started to notice a weird phenomenon

19203 :  but i cant help but think what would have happened when i got my letter inviting me for my

19204 :  why wouldnt we start to think about

19205 :  whether like myself its a partial blindness or a sight impairment maybe hearing loss

19206 :  that s all it is

19207 :  my belief is this

19208 :  thats just part of the culture there

19209 :  how secure is your food supply

19210 :  so how do we break away from this

19211 :  later on hungarian composer b la bart k spent years traveling in the eastern european countryside

19212 :  its jackie joyner kersee who in one thousand nine hundred and eightyfour missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one

19213 :  one held a half eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching

19214 :  and they passed me and smiled but they sized me up as they made their way to the turf

19215 :  i feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the museum of modern art on a retrospective of

19216 :  and in only five years one thousand nine hundred companies have joined from more than forty countries

19217 :  please show us your pain and resistance against a factor ten
19218 :  can you take a swim in the river without health risks

19219 :  why am i so sure about that

19220 :  can you trust your neighbors or the next person that comes along

19221 :  well just the same principles apply

19222 :  theres no lights inside the skull

19223 :  the brain doesnt hear sound or see light

19224 :  youre locked inside a bony skull trying to figure whats out there in the world

19225 :  somehow within each of our brains the combined activity of many billions of neurons each one

19226 :  how does the brain generate the experience of being a body and of having a body

19227 :  nothing at all

19228 :  so our most basic experiences of being a self of being an embodied organism are deeply grounded

19229 :  id like you to think about consciousness in the way that weve come to think about life

19230 :  now for most people after a while this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand is in fact

19231 :  and in this process is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy

19232 :  but my experiences of the body from within theyre not like that at all

19233 :  i will take you from kuala lumpur to barcelona to beirut

19234 :  most days my name is waitress at my familys damascus restaurant full time

19235 :  and this happened over and over and over again

19236 :  and then if we balance ourselves in these two dimensions well create the optimum environment for ourselves and each

19237 :  and then i said to her mom youve been a good mom to me and my brother youve loved us youve loved

19238 :  my footsteps have not always been easy

19239 :  and so pushed me a little touch more

19240 :  they knew it was possible

19241 :  my parents were there to share the moment with me

19242 :  it was now or never my pacer and i agreed

19243 :  girls who are brave enough to sit outside of their comfort zone

19244 :  i want there to be more sisu girls in our world

19245 :  my body came alive

19246 :  i was in the worse place ive ever been in a race before

19247 :  to me whats important is the principle

19248 :  they do not

19249 :  so in another study we did we used publicly available data about searches in google

19250 :  how is it different from other crops

19251 :  so we went back and forth negotiating

19252 :  night passed next morning hundreds of the farmers from that cooperative went to

19253 :  we dont trust anybody

19254 :  and you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy

19255 :  so uranium which is very big wants to split

19256 :  we really need it now

19257 :  i wish we had more money i wish we had more resources

19258 :  its a medium sized nucleus

19259 :  you get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point the strong force grips them together

19260 :  and you can get energy out this way

19261 :  but thats not electricity yet

19262 :  but thats not really fusion power

19263 :  weve been trying for fifty years

19264 :  its pretty hot

19265 :  but there is a catch

19266 :  this is a bit shocking because in fact our government is relying on that for us to meet kyoto and do all those kind of

19267 :  but one of the profound things that einstein showed us is when you have light

19268 :  a tesseract that were all familiar with

19269 :  so i think ive made my point that we have to

19270 :  im talking about opec oil

19271 :  i got out of school in fiftyone
19272 :  the oil is priced off the margin

19273 :  dont i wish

19274 :  but no im not

19275 :  im not sure

19276 :  now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both

19277 :  there had to have been eight hundred thousand wells fracked in oklahoma texas kansas

19278 :  there is no question

19279 :  youre going to have to have energy

19280 :  somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas producer in the united states

19281 :  its my life

19282 :  are we smarter than anybody else

19283 :  youve made the money you need

19284 :  i own stocks

19285 :  its what were going to use in the future

19286 :  i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in one thousand nine hundred and fiftythree
19287 :  see but again i told you i dont have to worry with that

19288 :  and i said bridge to what

19289 :  worth t has been on it for twentyfive years

19290 :  where are we headed

19291 :  i think its probably one hundred and seventyfive billion barrels

19292 :  this stuff is everywhere

19293 :  why are all the trash trucks today in southern california on natural gas

19294 :  fracking came out in fortyseven and dont believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says

19295 :  i saw my first one in fiftythree
19296 :  my earliest childhood memories are of triple beam scales used to weigh outrageous amounts of

19297 :  the project is part art and part science

19298 :  because for the first time youre going to be able to construct a web page where the entire

19299 :  and the simplest way to look at is look at the google results page

19300 :  theyll probably be just short of that

19301 :  but guess what

19302 :  and im suggesting were going to have a jump off of their revenue

19303 :  it is a programming language

19304 :  if you dont know what html five is let me help you understand

19305 :  and in a world where the u

19306 :  we have photographers who work every show we have painters and the notion is i believe that

19307 :  but i want you to understand ive been working with this group of hypotheses now for about ten months and whats really

19308 :  because it essentially opens up a new canvas

19309 :  and when the time has come towards the end of the pregnancy the baby decides

19310 :  now heres a good example of spiritual practices and geographical realities combining to

19311 :  and its only when theyre preparing to return this young man home so that he can die that they realize whats

19312 :  it begins in a garret in the late 17th century in the swiss university town of

19313 :  the problem with this picture is it doesnt entirely capture what an emotion

19314 :  was it perhaps the coming of modernity with its celebration of restlessness and travel and

19315 :  was it the invention of telephones or the expansion of the railways

19316 :  i think to be truly emotionally intelligent we need to understand where those words have come

19317 :  well in one thousand six hundred and eightyeight a young doctor johannes hofer heard of this case and others like it and christened

19318 :  so you see a bear your heart rate quickens your pupils dilate you feel frightened you run very very

19319 :  the last person to die from nostalgia was an american soldier fighting during the first

19320 :  so how do you build that

19321 :  keep in mind these are organisms who are much smaller

19322 :  so to get the same amount of product you have to confine a whole lot more of them and kill and harm a lot more of them

19323 :  so this is certainly a partial list

19324 :  in the depths of my studies of philosophy i learned a simple truth about justice and some powerful mind

19325 :  and suppose that you met a veterinarian or found out about one that was treating dogs or cats in any one of these

19326 :  now ninetyfive of the land animals raised for food in the united states are

19327 :  its an ongoing fight

19328 :  i recently finished my ph

19329 :  so when you look for example at metropolitan areas such as the boston area minneapolis st

19330 :  they hand out all kinds of business tax breaks

19331 :  now those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions and the way they can

19332 :  and so theyll both underinvest because everyones going to move out

19333 :  or at least enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy

19334 :  when legislators and others think about economic development what they first of all think about are business tax

19335 :  ive spent most of my career researching these programs

19336 :  specifically the interdependency here is is that there are huge

19337 :  its a somewhat more indirect way

19338 :  another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern

19339 :  so clearly the productivity of firms in silicon valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at

19340 :  ive talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues a lot of legislators about these issues

19341 :  that is the notion of investment

19342 :  its not exactly a low cost proposition

19343 :  well one obvious barrier is cost

19344 :  at least i hope not

19345 :  you sacrifice now for a return later

19346 :  the federal government has a lot on its plate and state governments are going to have to step up

19347 :  and turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips i read

19348 :  i wasnt weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom

19349 :  so if you want to change peoples lives start by changing peoples numbers

19350 :  he became one of the most energetic science students i had all year and at the end of the year he told me something that forever

19351 :  you see theres a million things that seems that can affect our mood

19352 :  but he never put a mood number below eighty again

19353 :  i was sick to my stomach

19354 :  whats your number today

19355 :  and it does change throughout the day

19356 :  and i wouldnt know it till the end of the year

19357 :  youre going to be there arent you

19358 :  that wouldnt quiet be correct right

19359 :  it was handed down to us by the greeks

19360 :  ive seen waves happen on water

19361 :  reductionism would say

19362 :  that was the first time i understood viscerally just for a fleeting moment

19363 :  now you actually know how they connect to each other by looking at their facebook page

19364 :  why are they engaging with cyberspace

19365 :  well my theory is that its happening because censorship actually is less effective than you

19366 :  so you may wonder why on earth are they doing it

19367 :  and i said okay well then what do we do here

19368 :  where is he

19369 :  i didnt know much about it but she was stunning and id never met a model like this before

19370 :  we might even get a text message if our doctor was running late because he had to go into surgery so that we wouldnt have to sit there

19371 :  and so we dont have any members yet

19372 :  but anyhow were really trying hard to capture these values

19373 :  this is a term that we coined in our little co op and were a little different

19374 :  and its one of the best co op stories and those entities and co op businesses still exist today

19375 :  or it can be we ask everyone who signs up to commit to

19376 :  and its this co opiness that is how we think our co op is going to work in health insurance

19377 :  so back to values

19378 :  and thats one of the major reasons why people cant get health insurance today is because its so hard to afford

19379 :  and it misses the point

19380 :  i mean imagine a healthcare system that was created for consumers

19381 :  so we started taking these groups

19382 :  it is not cowardice

19383 :  my parents used to have depression

19384 :  you can move on to curing yourself to getting help

19385 :  sometimes you have to

19386 :  and we struggle with how to deal with them

19387 :  i think that is wrong

19388 :  it was very controversial to say three four five years ago

19389 :  we can only solve this through a political solution

19390 :  that if you move towards democracy if you move towards taking part in

19391 :  how will we ever be interlocutors

19392 :  everybody seems to agree with that

19393 :  all of a sudden ngos were not only standing in the streets crying their slogans but they were taking them

19394 :  and sometimes military intervention is necessary

19395 :  its the wine industry

19396 :  the farm to table movement

19397 :  while at first the numbers were overwhelming the finger lakes wine industry produces over eleven thousand
19398 :  but like all questions and lessons there are numerous layers that need to be peeled in order for the

19399 :  in my third lesson i needed to figure out if wine flour could be important enough to

19400 :  the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed

19401 :  you cant fight it so embrace it and find a way to work with it

19402 :  this distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people more in with the people

19403 :  so with the act of observing consumers changes their behavior

19404 :  the marketing is the message for marketing is that try to measure what consumers actually

19405 :  its the same in marketing

19406 :  and young people dont forget just how powerful you are and how your peers

19407 :  and nearly one in four twentyfour said that the bullying made them feel suicidal

19408 :  dont take over the problem instead give them some of that power back and work with them to come up with a solution

19409 :  unicef states that there are over two
19410 :  arguably vegetarians might eat this

19411 :  and if you dont think so go visit the seaport

19412 :  very counter intuitive

19413 :  so wait a minute

19414 :  free like sidewalks free like lighting in the street part of the public realm

19415 :  why does it work

19416 :  youve gone through these loops

19417 :  so you can present yourself in sort of on stage ways and off stage ways

19418 :  but interesting and complex and a brilliant presentation of you thats what we need to think about when you think

19419 :  so if someone looks at that youd think brilliant

19420 :  and thats kind of interesting

19421 :  i totally love these things

19422 :  youre creating something beautiful and complex like this dale chihuly glass sculpture

19423 :  it might be silly

19424 :  and i think thats what id like to portray to people

19425 :  i recognize that person as myself

19426 :  and five percent of them have found something online they did not want to see

19427 :  some of those things are really visible and some of them are really invisible

19428 :  is that history of you

19429 :  this is my cat godfrey

19430 :  they are creative fantastic tools

19431 :  is it what you want it to

19432 :  some of that im pleased about are some of this i really missed

19433 :  they are like a big giant yarn shop for anonymity

19434 :  it can be really fantastic to build up your network

19435 :  what does that say about you

19436 :  your parents might be on facebook

19437 :  caring for the people caring for nature sharing

19438 :  and we planted on prairie

19439 :  that is i think what we can do by the means of business and profit

19440 :  one of the compounds that these microalgae produce are actually omega 3s the same omega

19441 :  the most powerful game changer is actually using the same

19442 :  then a special interesting kind of plants that does this are the microalgae

19443 :  there are scenarios by the united nations food and agriculture organization that our fisheries might

19444 :  but ive moved on

19445 :  part of mes interminable it goes on and on and on and on and on and

19446 :  its called they say that fish

19447 :  how are they organized

19448 :  similar data has been around for quite some time

19449 :  even the salad haters that come to the growhaus try it and go nuts for it

19450 :  so what do we do

19451 :  we start work on the first day

19452 :  well over one thousand people use those toilets

19453 :  because that flushes the bug out

19454 :  and for a whole house the nine healthy living practices we test check and fix two hundred and fifty items in every

19455 :  but all of a sudden now there was a second problem

19456 :  and he came out and within a day it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground the wind

19457 :  and that to me is the key

19458 :  is this eliminating poverty

19459 :  why do we have to do this work

19460 :  so two problems and design should be about more than one thing

19461 :  you cant breathe as well

19462 :  i put it to you

19463 :  the third thing is when you suppress emotions other peoples blood pressure goes up

19464 :  case in point being

19465 :  if you noticed you have them maybe when youre swimming doing laps

19466 :  its quite surprising

19467 :  one thing i discovered is great ideas dont spread by themselves quite often they need a

19468 :  teaching people about their brain made them far more effective at whatever they wanted to achieve

19469 :  theres a huge amount of research in there quite surprising how limited it is

19470 :  well its not the water but many people make this false correlation and many other false

19471 :  i help leaders and managers in mostly large organizations make better

19472 :  you know how that is

19473 :  i was very surprised by that it wasnt where id expected i would end up

19474 :  thank you very much

19475 :  it actually creates a threat response in other people which is quite surprising

19476 :  what happens in organizations is many managers accidentally do all the wrong things they tell people what they should be doing

19477 :  its a delight to be here i think these events are very important

19478 :  and i think its time to put some focus on that and really make a difference there

19479 :  i had dinner last week with one of the founders of the mindfulness movement very important figure daniel siegel and he was

19480 :  but weve hardly made any improvements in how we relate to each other in thirty fifty one hundred years

19481 :  i was in chicago last week talking to someone from a large organization and she was kind of laughing at herself and i

19482 :  reappraisal for example might be youre having an argument with someone and you actually manage to see the situation

19483 :  from france to haiti from the streets to our homes revolutionary freedom fighters have been

19484 :  we are not meant to save the earth we are meant to leave it behind

19485 :  a dream that i had not let myself take seriously for a long time began to tug at me

19486 :  as storytellers we know what we imagine were likely to create

19487 :  but the second thing i would like to leave you with a challenge a challenge in the sense of its a promise a promise for yourself to change for

19488 :  im not obsessed over social media anymore

19489 :  so heres where i want to take a second to ask you a very simple but rather significant question

19490 :  but i remember very clearly i looked at myself in the mirror that day and i asked myself one simple question

19491 :  pausing is the things that you do already

19492 :  what exactly do i know about myself to have even decided i want to stay here

19493 :  is my life simply too busy with essays

19494 :  because if youre not aware of it then you wouldnt really care if it goes away from your life

19495 :  we would always want to be the other perfect person

19496 :  and so we start faking our lives

19497 :  im falling and my grades are bad i need to leave

19498 :  i said dad listen i cant do this i have to leave

19499 :  and thats the most important thing

19500 :  the social platforms that claim to make us more social

19501 :  what exactly is that moment of my day that i would do and i would love to appreciate and embrace it more often

19502 :  you start creating an ideal self of yourself its like a superhero

19503 :  where do i want to be in four years

19504 :  and the usual thing happened we rushed across campus and at the end of the day just before getting to bed i was

19505 :  now i could pause in the morning

19506 :  and i would have simply said being on the stage is out of reach

19507 :  and thats a big question

19508 :  whats my objective of deciding to stay here

19509 :  youre on the right track

19510 :  where do i want to be

19511 :  so now i was obsessed over pausing

19512 :  but its not because you want to

19513 :  and i mean it when i say a lot

19514 :  even being here today could be a pause moment

19515 :  after thirty hours in the lab i probably smelled horrible

19516 :  it seemed to be about right but i couldnt quite tell

19517 :  if you have a basic income thats equal for everybody the relatively poor the relatively

19518 :  for a long time people said that a basic income is impossible

19519 :  shes able to walk

19520 :  what would it take for us to fall in love with those products that are here to serve us

19521 :  in other words if the patient simply does not like the brace she wont wear the brace and if she doesnt wear the brace

19522 :  they amplify each other

19523 :  what if we changed this all

19524 :  by her engaging in the products creation that is for her body she will then like it

19525 :  its the only one of its kind

19526 :  her response was you cant

19527 :  it re writes the way we design a product

19528 :  but what if we shook things up a bit

19529 :  raphael dont make me come over there

19530 :  how do we change this

19531 :  how do we close that gap that i described between the

19532 :  and so we have talked to the writers guild in hollywood and guess what

19533 :  could i call you back

19534 :  but what were going to do first is give you a taste of the opening number

19535 :  clearly something important is going on

19536 :  thats the next step

19537 :  so were going to write this up and try to submit this for publication

19538 :  and now we want to share

19539 :  whats the point

19540 :  and the discussion is who cares

19541 :  thats what science offers us

19542 :  so how can we ever do anything new

19543 :  what if they selected poorly

19544 :  and girls who were more romantically competent were engaging in fewer

19545 :  it is called couples therapy

19546 :  with insight you will be able to learn from your mistakes in ways that allow you to behave differently in the future

19547 :  so maybe she was feeling kind of anxious

19548 :  i do couples therapy and it can be a wonderful thing

19549 :  we identified the skills based on a thorough review of theory and research

19550 :  or maybe youll realize its just the opposite that youre not ready to settle down and you need a partner who is ok

19551 :  and because they represent the commonalities we think they really can help people with all the

19552 :  im going to figure this out

19553 :  and wouldnt all of our relationships benefit from this

19554 :  that text isnt coming youre getting really anxious youre checking your phone every two seconds

19555 :  in one of our studies we looked at thirteen and fourteen year old girls early adolescent girls and we found

19556 :  my point is this

19557 :  and they are better at providing helpful support when needed

19558 :  you know this is going to be stressful for me

19559 :  this is the worst thing ever

19560 :  so you might think

19561 :  and this brings me back to my point that we need to be teaching people how to have healthy

19562 :  theyre also better at seeking and providing support to their partners

19563 :  there is a way to deal with this

19564 :  if you beg and plead to get back together youre not going to feel good about yourself and you dont even want to be in a

19565 :  but many people come to couples therapy with so many ingrained problems and patterns that they

19566 :  there is a large body of literature on romantic relationships that has identified the features of healthy

19567 :  now towards this end my colleagues and i have developed a skills based model of relationship

19568 :  so they are more willing to ask for what they need and use what their partners give them

19569 :  ive been studying romantic competence the ability for people to use insight mutuality and emotion

19570 :  she didnt get anything

19571 :  and she got really angry and they had a big fight

19572 :  i know we are saving for that trip but i really like that necklace that we saw the other day and it wasnt that expensive

19573 :  if i promise to protect some time for us will you be ok with me taking this job

19574 :  everything is going to be ok

19575 :  with emotion regulation youll be able to tell yourself you know what

19576 :  we need to help people genuinely know what they want and need in a relationship

19577 :  so lets say you have a breakup

19578 :  they felt comfortable being close to people they could trust people they werent worried about being rejected

19579 :  insight also would have let her know that her partner was the kind of guy who was just going to take what she said

19580 :  we may know what a healthy relationship looks like but most people have no idea how to get one and

19581 :  its nothing about you or the relationship

19582 :  this is what the notion of romantic competence is all about

19583 :  we need to help them select the right partner

19584 :  and researchers would agree too

19585 :  with insight you might notice or realize that its not that your partner is doing anything but actually youre

19586 :  how many people know i mean really know what to do on a day to day basis to

19587 :  so maybe youll recognize that youre the kind of person who tends to jump in really quickly you get wrapped up in the

19588 :  this is going to be all right

19589 :  lets say your partner shows up late for a date

19590 :  what you really need is to relax a little bit so it doesnt bleed out over into your relationship

19591 :  and this isnt just what they told us we actually observed them doing this in our laboratory where we asked them to

19592 :  id really love for you to be there youll be a really good buffer for me

19593 :  researchers also agree on what makes for unhealthy relationships things like fighting so much that you

19594 :  thats just who your partner is

19595 :  i mean the beginning beginning like as soon as possible

19596 :  so guess what

19597 :  we have data to support this as well

19598 :  so lets say you get a great job offer that youd like to take but you know it means you will to have to work more and you

19599 :  i dont need to check my phone every second im just going to put it away and focus on the task at

19600 :  you are not ok with your partner seeing other people

19601 :  you might say directly

19602 :  political scientist victor asal and colleagues have looked at several factors that shape a political groups

19603 :  so that means you are creating an environment that has a mission and a reason behind it so people know how to react and respond when

19604 :  they meet because they have a caffeine fix and they want coffee before any of the hosts are there to make coffee

19605 :  so that means that as city dwellers we are only running into each other basically hurrying to and from our work our

19606 :  naysawn joined the hub because he was working from home all the time

19607 :  again that means were not listening to each other

19608 :  pew research did a study of ten thousand american adults and they found that at this moment we are more polarized we are more

19609 :  but i still have a great conversation with them

19610 :  and more importantly it is not about you

19611 :  i can bolster my own identity

19612 :  dont equate your experience with theirs

19613 :  if you dont know say that you dont know

19614 :  it was written by a high school teacher named paul barnwell

19615 :  weve had them before

19616 :  and he gave his kids a communication project

19617 :  dont think about what youre going to have for dinner

19618 :  all experiences are individual

19619 :  you need to let them come and let them go

19620 :  stick to the weather and your health

19621 :  leave them out

19622 :  and we do the exact same thing

19623 :  so our minds are filling in those other two hundred and seventyfive words

19624 :  the kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired or where you feel like youve made a real

19625 :  and look i know it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone but if you

19626 :  err on the side of caution

19627 :  people who brag about their iqs are losers

19628 :  one more rule number ten and its this one

19629 :  but theres another reason

19630 :  dont think about your argument you had with your boss

19631 :  theyre the ones that know

19632 :  now people on the radio especially on npr are much more aware that theyre going on the record and so theyre more

19633 :  theres this great piece in the atlantic

19634 :  and many of them almost most of them are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to

19635 :  we get distracted

19636 :  so forget the details

19637 :  because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it and youre going to get a much more

19638 :  that means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind

19639 :  they dont care

19640 :  and i dont mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand

19641 :  if you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument

19642 :  the famed therapist m

19643 :  it is never the same

19644 :  let them describe it

19645 :  and calvin coolidge said no man ever listened his way out of a job

19646 :  somebody asked stephen hawking once what his iq was and he said i have no idea

19647 :  were sitting there having a conversation with someone and then we remember that time that we met hugh jackman in a coffee

19648 :  i talk to people that i dont like

19649 :  she won a pulitzer prize

19650 :  he was the mayor of sacramento

19651 :  scott peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself

19652 :  a conversation requires a balance between talking and listening and somewhere along the way we lost that balance

19653 :  and he said this

19654 :  weve heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and

19655 :  so i want you to forget all of that

19656 :  i mean be present

19657 :  i talk to people that i like

19658 :  i came to realize

19659 :  stephen covey said it very beautifully

19660 :  there is no reason why most of your interactions cant be like that

19661 :  nobel prize winners truck drivers billionaires kindergarten teachers heads of state

19662 :  i talk to some people that i disagree with deeply on a personal level

19663 :  according to pew research about a third of american teenagers send more than a hundred

19664 :  try asking them things like what was that like

19665 :  what they care about is you

19666 :  yes i was very angry

19667 :  learn to have a conversation without wasting your time without getting bored and please god without

19668 :  and we are convinced that real changes in our society are only possible with the

19669 :  and its essential always to keep in mind this overall aim that unifies you with persons all over your country

19670 :  and this is so important because of course daily work isnt always the most passionate or the most

19671 :  so from turkey to the greek islands

19672 :  where are they

19673 :  its about bees and other pollinators in our environment and why theyre so important

19674 :  where can i get one

19675 :  im also working on an animated series called the pollinators

19676 :  did i have a business card

19677 :  and this quick easy money then goes on to fund the more serious types of crime and it pays the way to making these

19678 :  for a few years i also used to attend automotive trade shows taking place in huge

19679 :  you can make two thousand percent selling fakes online with little of the same risks or penalties

19680 :  and when was his next shipment going to arrive

19681 :  counterfeiting is set to become a two
19682 :  and they would sell me fake car parts faulty fake car parts that have been estimated to cause over

19683 :  relief only comes when you turn the first corner and glance behind and theyre not standing there

19684 :  where were the polo shirts coming from

19685 :  what paperwork did he have

19686 :  we have found the millers child was the message

19687 :  all he wanted was a mom all i wanted was a child

19688 :  my love has grown but is my love that great

19689 :  and i said something so awesome and great

19690 :  is basically me in a room with a camera talking to myself about africa and hoping that it makes any

19691 :  i think i paid like fifteen dollars a month for unlimited access to twitter

19692 :  on paper these countries seem very different

19693 :  they know each other by voice

19694 :  gals youre a little bit higher

19695 :  what theyre saying tends to be pretty mundane

19696 :  for others they appear to be pondering the woes of the world

19697 :  they really arent

19698 :  sweet sweet i am so sweet

19699 :  so we went down into the woods and i got my first shot

19700 :  there are a thousand ways to come at any challenge to find that extraordinary view

19701 :  and i was setting up what i thought was the last dismal shot of a dismal day

19702 :  there s more than one right answer

19703 :  and thats the story i want to share with you tonight

19704 :  i said yeah i got one

19705 :  they all want to try it on

19706 :  my win is your loss

19707 :  id get a flashlight

19708 :  i said sure

19709 :  i said yes sir

19710 :  and my grandmother was tough but she was also loving

19711 :  have some beer

19712 :  and this man came over to me and he hugged me

19713 :  when i would see her as a little boy shed come up to me and shed give me these hugs

19714 :  im not going to have any beer

19715 :  but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem

19716 :  my brother said come on

19717 :  we love innovation

19718 :  and yet fortysix percent of all homicide cases dont result in arrest

19719 :  i actually learned about this from my grandmother

19720 :  vaclav havel the great czech leader talked about this

19721 :  i said im a lawyer

19722 :  what would you say to someone who believed that

19723 :  today there are two
19724 :  i said yes sir

19725 :  and thats a very sensible question

19726 :  i had written these crazy things

19727 :  she said now you make sure you dont do that

19728 :  were trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice

19729 :  and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler

19730 :  and i have to tell you it was energizing

19731 :  and of course we can never have the death penalty in germany

19732 :  parks is coming to town

19733 :  my cousins would be running around everywhere

19734 :  you all go ahead

19735 :  and as soon as i walked inside the judge saw me coming in

19736 :  there was a crazy line in there about how theres no conduct in this county its all misconduct

19737 :  were going to get together and talk

19738 :  and id say yes maam i do

19739 :  you should ask for some of that

19740 :  it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know its deeply

19741 :  it will get to you

19742 :  he kept pacing back and forth

19743 :  he said youre a lawyer

19744 :  it would be so energizing and so empowering

19745 :  were actually projecting in another ten years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as its been since prior to the

19746 :  and then my brother started staring at me

19747 :  it was this misguided war on drugs

19748 :  that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions

19749 :  he said jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom

19750 :  i had the great privilege when i was a young lawyer of meeting rosa parks

19751 :  i said okay mama

19752 :  in one thousand nine hundred and seventytwo there were three hundred thousand people in jails and prisons

19753 :  this country is very different today than it was forty years ago

19754 :  he said we dont have the death penalty in germany

19755 :  yall go ahead

19756 :  i had some your sister had some

19757 :  and out of the corner of my eye i could see this janitor pacing back and forth

19758 :  were constantly running into each other

19759 :  he said whats wrong with you

19760 :  well i adored my mom so i said yes mama

19761 :  for every nine people who have been executed weve actually identified one innocent person whos been exonerated and

19762 :  and because i was up too late wasnt thinking real straight i started working on a motion

19763 :  were constantly creating tensions and conflicts

19764 :  and these women would get together and just talk

19765 :  we need to find ways to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering

19766 :  we dont really know very much about it

19767 :  the first phone call

19768 :  however participants in this experiment were not explicitly told that their brains would

19769 :  is it acceptable to alter a human being and supposedly improve them if it goes against their

19770 :  this young man was none other than alexander graham bell

19771 :  diversity is one of the most important aspects of our world and with different backgrounds come different

19772 :  there are robots that do your vacuuming for you and cars that will soon be able to self drive

19773 :  help a billion people

19774 :  a few weeks ago a guy from a berlin based company called me trying to sell me a business

19775 :  a year ago i had the chance to participate in this program for entrepreneurs at the singularity

19776 :  moment in a doctors office when he went to prescribe the same medication that my grandfather was on at that time in order

19777 :  i didnt even have the diagnosis of schizophrenia

19778 :  however when it moved its legs the creaking of the legs sounded like young children laughing

19779 :  red hair and white skin

19780 :  and i am confident that i would not be here today if i didnt get the proper medical help

19781 :  but theres a problem

19782 :  i would also hallucinate spiders sometimes little spiders

19783 :  but it became very prevalent in my junior year of high school and then it just snowballed

19784 :  the clown is actually in the audience today and you would never know

19785 :  but you would never know that im hallucinating

19786 :  and im not going to rest until anyone who has schizophrenia

19787 :  i was actually amazed

19788 :  because my life had become a waking nightmare

19789 :  i talked to the doctors they said ok lets fix the meds you can stay here overnight

19790 :  this cant be on our medical history

19791 :  there is no nonprofit in the entire united states focused on that

19792 :  today im going to be talking about my story with schizophrenia

19793 :  so i admitted myself into the emergency room

19794 :  we need to change the face of schizophrenia because the representation currently is

19795 :  i commend her for her bravery

19796 :  redifer where friends were passing by and seeing me put into a police car

19797 :  two negative words

19798 :  good and bad clean and dirty acceptable and taboo there exists a great deal of overlap between and in fact

19799 :  it does however call into question the line thats posited between those who

19800 :  after all even internet users who dont think they know much about trolling have likely encountered a whole

19801 :  it can take many forms from harmless pranks all the way to behaviors that meet the legal

19802 :  why study trolls

19803 :  one or two people said i had no idea my country contributed so much

19804 :  everything that happens in one country sooner or later has an impact on things in other countries

19805 :  thats the 21st century world

19806 :  mexico cant fix drug trafficking

19807 :  of their own bodies or the bodies of their partners

19808 :  we are men and women of all races and sexualities working together

19809 :  therefore what i want to say to you today is its time to talk differently about sexual and reproductive health and rights

19810 :  men need sex more than women do and thats what women expect

19811 :  this man reflecting the behavior and views of so many others put his own sexual pleasure

19812 :  sexual reproductive health and rights remain seen as a womens issue and primarily their responsibility and

19813 :  i did improv since i was about thirteen ive been doing it ever since

19814 :  i tried to write about things that new yorkers experience and i figured what do new yorkers experience more than duane

19815 :  i consider those to be making an impact as well

19816 :  so today i am going to tell you about my journey over the last year where i have accidentally became a

19817 :  i notice a few things

19818 :  theyre not dropping you off on the corner and saying good luck buddy

19819 :  what if we take one idea and that idea is gender

19820 :  is this all a big deal

19821 :  as opposed to now im going to pay twenty
19822 :  and they say eighteen
19823 :  i am learning new york i have lived here for over a decade so i focus on new york

19824 :  fortythree and you pay

19825 :  allow me to share this with you as well

19826 :  my dad is a farmer

19827 :  hi my name is maryam elassar

19828 :  crochet instructions in a math journal

19829 :  well what is a curvature

19830 :  so i tried i had to slow down this exponential growth and make this ratio closer to one

19831 :  this looks like a crochet pattern

19832 :  oh yeah now thats great

19833 :  if i would be in a hyperbolic plane i wouldnt be able to do it because if i would try to fold it and get

19834 :  the same night i started to crochet

19835 :  its the best if you can make it yourself

19836 :  how could i imagine something which i didnt know how to imagine

19837 :  and then she said

19838 :  how many genes

19839 :  and my mother taught me all about germs and how bad they were and you should always wash your hands and i

19840 :  so if you breed a little mouse that has no biome this little creature is very vulnerable to

19841 :  i would suggest we probably just need to look inside of us and really get humble because the

19842 :  were only ten percent

19843 :  also were beginning to understand that a lot of the what is called autoimmune diseases

19844 :  these kinds of things are when there is a dysbiosis theres an imbalance between the good

19845 :  so first of all we have to respect them

19846 :  so we just heard how wonderful it is to look at the astronomy and be humbled

19847 :  you know they dont kind of hang out with their puppy brothers and sisters and they dont eat well and they dont do things

19848 :  what are the genes that we have

19849 :  they have a night and day rhythm just like we do

19850 :  so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than

19851 :  now if you like any of those outcomes you can support reinventing fire without needing to like

19852 :  rather when smart autos exchange electricity and information through smart buildings with smart grids theyre

19853 :  and the goal then is to use that expert brain map as a

19854 :  so this is one of the most dangerous viruses in the world

19855 :  and several different scientific teams were wondering but why

19856 :  its as simple as that

19857 :  whats the next thing to come forward

19858 :  this is the only way well get through this

19859 :  mostly very very great wonderful things you would say thats terrific

19860 :  and he saw it

19861 :  we get all offended and we take it personal the minute something comes up

19862 :  im going to sort of put it into a context using a story

19863 :  we get all offended the race card

19864 :  so she went

19865 :  and the way we tend to sometimes want to deal with them is on an individual basis

19866 :  i didnt talk to her but she also didnt talk to me

19867 :  similarly the recession caused a collapse in tax revenues

19868 :  so i dont subscribe to the view thats put forward in a lot of newspapers that just because somebody

19869 :  i would just like to say that thats absolute rubbish

19870 :  now i dont have much time so i dont have time to go through all those different initiatives that are coming

19871 :  now im not suggesting for a second that we should get rid of stock markets completely i dont think that at all

19872 :  and im not just talking about rbs and lloyds that had direct money injected into them by the

19873 :  so ill give you an example of the sort of thing multinational companies do

19874 :  where have we gone wrong

19875 :  because were turning around to all the people who cant afford an army of accountants and lawyers

19876 :  i think there are tons of things that business and the market does really really well

19877 :  and at the moment i think most people would agree there are a lot of people out there who are severely overpaid in

19878 :  they had a recession so more people fell into unemployment and needed unemployment benefits

19879 :  now i would one hundred agree with both of those things

19880 :  now for a country like greece theres a kernel of truth in that but for the other countries no

19881 :  and their response to this is to say oh but theres lots of other initiatives that are coming in and thats going to mop

19882 :  well you know something like the cayman islands is a sovereign state its entitled to set its tax rates

19883 :  now what that multinational corporation can do is it can set up a subsidiary company

19884 :  there was just this blind faith this automatic assumption that this absolutely must be a great way

19885 :  so the question is more

19886 :  and we need to start recognizing its limitations and not just religiously applying

19887 :  and its that sort of mentality that we really have to move away from because a belief in the

19888 :  be under no mistake the eurozone crisis and the two thousand and eight
19889 :  so the fact that they can go out and borrow in the markets at lower rates of interest than they could do if the market

19890 :  a way to make a lot of money

19891 :  and obviously this is an event thats been organized by the london business school so i imagine lots of people in

19892 :  and similarly if a business wants to locate in the cayman islands it should be allowed to do that

19893 :  and if were going to start getting people to believe in capitalism again

19894 :  and this isnt something that im just making up

19895 :  there isnt the empirical evidence to back up this claim

19896 :  the bank of england have done a lot of research into this and think this is worth billions of pounds per year to banks like

19897 :  so i now work on financial reform in a think tank but i used to work on the trading floor of

19898 :  well no its not

19899 :  now a lot of you are probably thinking

19900 :  i mean theyre both extreme like i say almost religious values to hold and clearly you know some are

19901 :  and the problem with that system is that that means that all these businesses and those managers are

19902 :  i think once again there are lots of things that stock markets are good at

19903 :  theyre going to talk to the machine

19904 :  why should you be doing that

19905 :  and were seeing that already with say phones

19906 :  thats a big disk

19907 :  you can start thinking about collaboration you can actually manipulate the same hologram with

19908 :  the trick is to get them to use the same vocabulary

19909 :  thats what id like to address today

19910 :  but theres something you may not know about this story which i find really interesting

19911 :  but its not just to throw people together there needs to be a boundary there needs to be a structure on how

19912 :  but once you do magic can happen

19913 :  and we know what happened

19914 :  well not too much lives in them because theyre so cold and the entrance is actually covered up with snow for about eight months of the

19915 :  every year new caves get discovered that no one has ever been in before

19916 :  around this half of the country most of your caves are made of limestone

19917 :  if you squish a handful of snow to make a snowball it gets really small hard and dense

19918 :  different waterfalls pop up or move around from place to place inside the cave

19919 :  now these days with so many people hiking around its pretty hard to find a new cave so you can imagine how excited we were to

19920 :  we certainly have plenty of other options these days

19921 :  my father might be considered weird

19922 :  its great to have support

19923 :  and best of all my spiritual connection became much stronger

19924 :  were growing enough food to feed more than twice the population of all the human beings in the world

19925 :  some people say the vegan lifestyle doesnt work for their bodies

19926 :  my diet was reasonably good but not optimal

19927 :  my motivation to go veg was not health

19928 :  would she be overcome with joy and want to cuddle that bunny

19929 :  ladies how easy is it to break a nail

19930 :  why is that

19931 :  animal foods clog the arteries

19932 :  the only problem was i didnt know a single other vegetarian

19933 :  just wash it and bite into it as it is

19934 :  he calls it the canary in the coalmine

19935 :  have they really tried all twenty thousand plant foods before giving up

19936 :  were cutting down our magnificent rain forest at the rate of one acre per second for soy beans to feed cattle chickens

19937 :  once upon a time slavery was normal and it was commonly believed that the earth was flat

19938 :  plenty of plant foods are perfect just as they are

19939 :  or make a savory blended green soup

19940 :  it turns out its all about blood flow

19941 :  it felt like it was really important

19942 :  greetings to all of you from pakistan

19943 :  we are but two threads cut from the same cloth

19944 :  and if our fates are intertwined then we believe that it is good karma it is good

19945 :  why should we do this as indians and pakistanis

19946 :  this was the thought underlying the debt project started by network after imprisonment in

19947 :  there are several reasons for that

19948 :  why cant offenders solve their economic problems themselves

19949 :  they are very difficult to understand

19950 :  skinner and said that from the day you were born everything you did was because you wanted something for doing it

19951 :  now the management definition of empowerment is get it done

19952 :  how did you learn to do that

19953 :  teach them about consequences drive us

19954 :  really its all in how you see it

19955 :  so weve had a training question weve had an educational question this is the motivational question

19956 :  i mean training is to watch the behavior but online training is like plastic silverware

19957 :  how are the drums

19958 :  skinner taught us that too in his book beyond freedom and dignity way back in one thousand nine hundred and seventyone
19959 :  its your paradigm

19960 :  how do you inspire people to feel competent

19961 :  nice guys finish last

19962 :  i would like to share with you what the research says about how to make that happen

19963 :  i didnt have a nice drum like this

19964 :  my parents bought me a beatable drum at an auction

19965 :  well you give them feedback

19966 :  it is my dream job

19967 :  but thats for another talk

19968 :  i wanted it so badly

19969 :  its pretty cool when you know someone who starts a bakery

19970 :  and returning veterans who participate in farm programs are finding that they have lower

19971 :  now im no farmer

19972 :  i said look in georgia at least we want to know

19973 :  and my doctor on a whim sent me to get a full body bone scan which showed that there was some growth in my left leg

19974 :  that sent me to an x ray then to an mri

19975 :  so a few weeks after my diagnosis we went up to vermont and i decided to put jeff as the first person in the

19976 :  and we went to this apple orchard and i read him this letter

19977 :  i broke my left femur that day its the largest bone in your body and spent the next two months in a body

19978 :  i was hit by a passing sedan

19979 :  i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my

19980 :  so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men

19981 :  im bruce i said and promptly passed out

19982 :  i was at a wall

19983 :  thats why they were called ape hangers

19984 :  and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people i was actually proving to be a magnet

19985 :  and that was whats the one piece of advice you would give to my girls

19986 :  but when i came to see you i said i didnt believe in myself

19987 :  people were incredibly drawn

19988 :  instead it was everybody running the other way

19989 :  eighty five percent are under twentyone
19990 :  we kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing

19991 :  theyre like we are gonna give you a scholarship to attend a local community college in the fall

19992 :  stories of overcoming huge odd stories of being fourteen fifteen sixteen years old and waking up one day and say you know

19993 :  my life is a mess but im gonna do something different

19994 :  these girls had stories

19995 :  like ninetynine percent of all the animals that have once lived they go extinct likely due to a warming climate and

19996 :  they have social knits that are very close

19997 :  they bury their dead

19998 :  they educate the next of kin

19999 :  maybe its because elephants share many things in common with us

20000 :  when the heart says i dont know then its time to wait

20001 :  i watched how she was and i loved just how accomplished she was and my parents

20002 :  and in fact right now there is new circadian lighting in our international space station to

20003 :  circadian lighting at home factories offices will promote alertness and improve productivity

20004 :  just think about it

20005 :  to adapt to the twentyfour hour light dark cycle or day night cycle on our planet almost every

20006 :  but there is more to it

20007 :  and its the first movie that got us some amount of attention from the portland film scene

20008 :  if you think about it its not so obvious because if you take one molecule at a time and

20009 :  this was the idea that we tried to realize in the last few years

20010 :  what happened was in that case we go from a situation where we started where

20011 :  but unfortunately im an experimentalist which means for me its very difficult to be present while it takes place

20012 :  its very early to predict what else we can observe

20013 :  its very unlikely that any of us will live for long enough for this to happen again

20014 :  its much easier to model mathematically or at least we think so

20015 :  but weve got it switched right

20016 :  zucchini muffin whatever

20017 :  we have all become so brainwashed to think that sugar on a daily basis is okay

20018 :  you might not be able to concentrate you might kind of want to take a nap or you might want to eat more sugar

20019 :  that is how important your beta cells are you would die

20020 :  the highly processed carb foods

20021 :  eighty of the time keep your food in healthy wholesome choices and then put your sugar

20022 :  you probably thought about your heart

20023 :  inside your pancreas is a small cluster of cells called beta cells

20024 :  you have the knowledge and you have the power

20025 :  they live from the garbage

20026 :  you know the art project was just a pretext for this amazing human experience

20027 :  it was really important for me that the community felt connected to the words

20028 :  and that is something that often is missing from political advertising because in the united

20029 :  i wanted to be an archaeologist up until high school

20030 :  okay this little shortlist what are we going to do with it

20031 :  everybody answered that question yeah i drive cars better

20032 :  first we need to measure it and then we need to cure it

20033 :  give it to them and measure what the media know

20034 :  this is how they answered

20035 :  all different sectors have facts and there are organizations trying to spread awareness about these facts

20036 :  and ladies and gentlemen for the first time the informal results from a conference with u

20037 :  so already the pilots reveal this that so many in the public score worse than random so we have to think

20038 :  that will help you score better on our tests

20039 :  gapminder asked the public in sweden

20040 :  did you see how it moved

20041 :  do robots have souls

20042 :  moores law says that every single year the computers are going twice as fast

20043 :  mala did that today with us

20044 :  we had no established label like rogers and hammerstein or a successful movie or a novel

20045 :  but i dont think thats true either

20046 :  if we have done that building you might have gone to it and im pretty sure youve never invite me to talk to you on this stage

20047 :  and is that somehow help us as a community of learners who are trying to search out and

20048 :  you may say jim im not buying this idea that you get all this custom made stuff

20049 :  its the doorway open to all creativity innovation

20050 :  so i have a little test for you

20051 :  so what might that different way be

20052 :  we figured it out

20053 :  and so we get their approval

20054 :  but when we dont ask that question what do we normally get

20055 :  its different culture its a different environment a different biological sense to what it

20056 :  so what we have to do

20057 :  how would you want to enhance a human body

20058 :  she took my heart

20059 :  or does somebody want to run a marathon or does somebody want to ballroom dance

20060 :  in fact they had lower levels of heart disease in the 1950s when heart disease was absolutely

20061 :  what is it about community that you think is so powerful

20062 :  and fifteen thousand of the people that go to the church lost a combined

20063 :  they ate a lot more animal fat animal protein

20064 :  you know if you think about the 20th century it was all about our interaction with germs

20065 :  technology is coming along and empowering communication in new and exciting ways

20066 :  its all about the human race dominating germs

20067 :  start planting a garden

20068 :  its not just community

20069 :  get together groups of doctors to learn about functional medicine

20070 :  so what is this new model

20071 :  he has a whole community of people all around the world that egg each other on to be healthier through technology

20072 :  but the outcomes remain the same

20073 :  one of the best things the emerging science thats coming out right now citizen science project is showing the best way

20074 :  and the answer is a resounding yes

20075 :  they also smoked and drank as much as the other towns around them in america

20076 :  so i just want to prepare you for that ahead of time

20077 :  but we can talk about microbes if you prefer

20078 :  i just want to talk a minute about the use of community in medicine

20079 :  and what about doctors

20080 :  now what is the most evidence based thing that you could all do today to start this process of developing

20081 :  and feel the power of new community

20082 :  the first place that we see that community and not medicine creates health is the blue zones

20083 :  and it uses symptoms as a way to be able to understand whats going on and the root cause of dysfunction

20084 :  and what they found is the most evidence based strategy the most effective strategy

20085 :  and so the other thing that was so important to them was community

20086 :  seventeen years even today

20087 :  i wanted to rebel

20088 :  and betting on it for the future of chronic disease management

20089 :  the future of medicine isnt going to be something thats done to you and youre just a passive patient taking what the doctor gives you

20090 :  but in functional medicine it turns everything on its head

20091 :  and the human microbiome showed that more than ninetynine of all of the germs that live

20092 :  so again we see that its a community of microbes and not medicine that creates health

20093 :  and since then in the last four years theres been a wealth of science to show that germs

20094 :  were not asking brussels for permission were not asking london for permission we just have to

20095 :  so much so that its almost a joke in america now how pharmaceutical reps come and tell the doctor what to do with each of

20096 :  now i would bet that the kind of people that come to a tedx event like this are those people within a

20097 :  but the most exciting thing and what could really scale this up is technology

20098 :  and one of the biggest beneficiaries of that is communication

20099 :  we make fire we play games we go for experiences somewhere or what else we believe would be fun doing

20100 :  maybe theres a problem

20101 :  but maybe its because of the latter one

20102 :  go back try it again

20103 :  so i had my own special parking spot

20104 :  and its been incredible

20105 :  i am not a trained television personality

20106 :  i had no idea how i was going to do that

20107 :  we cant afford it

20108 :  so i knew that everything that i was doing then from that point forward and that was just a year ago my

20109 :  so i went to dr k and i said hey im just out of school i want to build a billion dollar company

20110 :  my cnbc show

20111 :  what i realized in that process though was the second point which is we have to get really

20112 :  and they said your daughter is not only learning disabled but we believe shes retarded

20113 :  the plane landed called dr k i said i figured it out

20114 :  and that timepiece keep it in mind whether its nine months or some other time for you thats critical too

20115 :  and what youre called to do is to do everything in your power to empower a billion

20116 :  and the reason that is critical is because if things i believe in the law of attraction but if things happened

20117 :  we need you

20118 :  he came back the next day gave us two hundred and fifty thousand and that really kicked off that first company for me and it also earned me

20119 :  we have a letter in the game

20120 :  lets ask that mom to read the letter

20121 :  theres also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather

20122 :  everybody understood that when we lose somebody the winners are not gloating

20123 :  theres a world bank arms dealers and a united nations

20124 :  and wed come in from playing hed come in from plowing and working and wed sit around that table every night

20125 :  and western europe is eight percent

20126 :  and so its reliable real data thats right in my face where i am so i can finish the

20127 :  because we give them so much information and they are entitled to really see how

20128 :  they made it fresh

20129 :  they made it aspirational

20130 :  it allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways

20131 :  not among the core values of the european project

20132 :  twice as likely

20133 :  there were always rockets going up into the sky up into space going up there

20134 :  now a bias is a way in which we systematically get things wrong ways in which we

20135 :  i used to watch a childrens news programme at the time and this was the era of space exploration

20136 :  and every time you get the same result

20137 :  and the bias i am talking about works like this

20138 :  and you neednt worry how long the book is or whether its a comic strip or an epic

20139 :  and so it should be with us

20140 :  we each live in the shadow of a personal apocalypse

20141 :  and the idea is simple its just this

20142 :  it can happen in different ways of course and usually comes in stages

20143 :  so those are the four basic kinds of immortality stories and ive tried to give just some sense of how theyre

20144 :  and is president of the math club

20145 :  then we talked about individual intelligence and collective intelligence

20146 :  and you were even able to actually get predictions from what is happening through this analysis of public opinion

20147 :  one of the most important elements we think in that respect is to be able to harness

20148 :  and then came robots

20149 :  and they have partially produced some fruit

20150 :  and in the end i will go to the most crucial question i think for today

20151 :  or maybe owning a bunch of stuff maybe that was rich

20152 :  if my actions today will make their tomorrow a little better then that is absolutely an

20153 :  so lets talk about how we implement the ideals of palliative care for our pets

20154 :  we understand that grief can be overwhelming so we have a registered

20155 :  over recent years we have seen dramatic changes in the standards of care that vets can

20156 :  it is about ensuring that we are adequately managing their pain and the progression of their

20157 :  then i dispense that extra pain relief because in that pets life

20158 :  however quite soon after graduation i realized that i also really cared about

20159 :  im a veterinarian which means that throughout my life my sole focus has always

20160 :  at its heart palliative medicine is about delivering the most compassionate care we can

20161 :  the csf fills the space that surrounds the brain and wastes from inside the brain make their way

20162 :  this group and many others got flints kids protected

20163 :  amongst them was one pithy counsel i will never forget

20164 :  now when i was getting involved when i said yes to this i had no idea what i was

20165 :  im not saying every scientist should be an activist

20166 :  there are real and sometimes very painful consequences of speaking up

20167 :  he was characterized a rogue employee and silenced

20168 :  during orientation the leaders dished out advice

20169 :  this is what i came to graduate school for and this is how i would rather spend my life

20170 :  not one mention of our moral and professional obligation of preventing harm to the public

20171 :  it wasnt until i arrived in graduate school and witnessed firsthand the criminal actions of

20172 :  they ridiculed residents asking for help while publicly insisting that the brown smelly

20173 :  these unhealthy cultures that are festering in these groups where the focus is on meeting regulations

20174 :  you know we fell in love with science when we were kids and yet we somehow spend most of our time during high

20175 :  fresh out of college i went to work for a consulting firm

20176 :  everyone was expected to follow orders coming from the top

20177 :  one of the most amazing experiences i ever had was swimming with a humpback whale and her

20178 :  none could hold their breath underwater

20179 :  so all of my childhood practice came in handy and i got the job

20180 :  but you know what

20181 :  but i just kept trying

20182 :  so i decided i was going to start working with underwater photographers

20183 :  so i had to create everything from scratch

20184 :  by bridging land and sea as a mermaid with a cause we were able to appeal to peoples

20185 :  now im not really model height so when i got there and i was surrounded by these glamorous amazons i thought

20186 :  back on land my joy began to turn to horror and dismay as i realized that these

20187 :  some may say that this is a fantasy

20188 :  that would have incredibly dire consequences for our entire ecosystem

20189 :  that just inspired me so much

20190 :  there was almost no interest

20191 :  and the judges were just so blown away by the fact that a bunch of teenagers could go and create things can

20192 :  but we quickly realized its not that easy

20193 :  my parents wanted out of me what any typical parent would want out of his child

20194 :  what it also does is it looks for leverage points small actions that have

20195 :  in order to do that we have to ask ourselves the following question

20196 :  why is that

20197 :  essentially i was still curious

20198 :  are we ready to accept this

20199 :  so from the moment we get into medical school its a deep culture of competition

20200 :  puzzled i scrolled the images myself

20201 :  at the end of a busy day when i was an hour behind i looked at the clock it was four
20202 :  we were part of decision making

20203 :  who quits their job in this economy

20204 :  even though i assured my dad that it was just a leave of absence he was unable to comprehend what was for him the sheer

20205 :  you quit your job are you crazy

20206 :  its not a paid event

20207 :  so who is showcasing culture

20208 :  the same thing in the darkroom

20209 :  when its bounced on the moon we see it

20210 :  we see where its bouncing but we dont see them as they exist

20211 :  stevenson glen lane paisley

20212 :  and as a consequence across the western world the over simplistic policies of the parties of protest and their appeal

20213 :  throughout that career i never accepted that a filmmaker should set about putting their own work outside or above what

20214 :  tabloid newspapers do not appear to advance the political citizenship of their readers relative even to

20215 :  if we want to provide decent fulfilling lives for our children and our childrens children we need to exercise to the very greatest

20216 :  the case of donoghue vs

20217 :  theyre not just less politically engaged

20218 :  why hadnt somebody else thought of it before

20219 :  and this was a very daunting prospect considering my scientific background was at the undergraduate level

20220 :  but how could my electronic devices harness this energy

20221 :  so in other words by virtue of having perspective we lack perspective

20222 :  just by thinking about the problem differently and by asking a lot of questions

20223 :  how can one thing one technology be applied to something else in the world

20224 :  and you observe a really strange effect

20225 :  but if youre an alien race who doesnt know any of this doesnt have any concept of earth intelligence youd be

20226 :  in cosmology for example there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that

20227 :  were trying to prevent an impact

20228 :  honestly we went down

20229 :  will he be able to be normal

20230 :  and that has been really a tough time

20231 :  and this is the message that we want to share with you

20232 :  i mean at the end will he be able to work

20233 :  nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities and as many questions as possible started to

20234 :  theres obviously a catch

20235 :  now as newly found philosophers i encourage you to think about differences between the actions required or the two

20236 :  now the question for you is

20237 :  that makes sense because deliberation takes a little time

20238 :  and this makes you philosophers

20239 :  some of you probably have heard about it before

20240 :  take back the power of your story and the other side says

20241 :  and last my tip for you is to ask yourself the question

20242 :  what is mine to do

20243 :  it s the time when we all have that sense

20244 :  that s what i think a story activist is and that s what i thought i was doing when the giz here in germany invited me to

20245 :  they hold our wisdom and our experience

20246 :  one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight the communist party was there

20247 :  i feel compelled to do so

20248 :  and even more than that

20249 :  so what story are we living in right now

20250 :  if you re human you are a storyteller so now is a good time to get good at it

20251 :  and i told them all as well

20252 :  and question what s already in there

20253 :  and he was right

20254 :  and so we kind of skipped off and we started to tell friends and family that we wanted to adopt

20255 :  and steven has an adoptive family and that isnt just emma and myself it is

20256 :  why would you want to do that

20257 :  we will do those things

20258 :  he believes our mission in life is to nag him and to stop him from doing everything he really wants to

20259 :  emma and i do those things

20260 :  that was it

20261 :  so what do we do next

20262 :  there are an awful lot of people out there who will disapprove of this very very strongly and you need

20263 :  that is going to be so hard

20264 :  we were given homework to do our parents were interviewed our friends were interviewed and it was all

20265 :  for us it was our first choice and it was an exciting new beginning

20266 :  it was amazing for us but it was incredibly positive for steven at that very difficult

20267 :  my partner emma and i got to a stage in our relationship where we wanted to start a family like lots

20268 :  steven has lovely granddads he has amazing uncles cousins

20269 :  would you like a job or would you like a family

20270 :  he thinks were totally embarrassing

20271 :  and that was amazing

20272 :  we rope in the husbands of our friends and we rope in our own male friends and

20273 :  we had lots of people who said im sorry

20274 :  steven has a birth family and we have contact with them

20275 :  he is not some sort of lifestyle accessory for me

20276 :  he doesnt really want to be seen out with us in public

20277 :  the hope was that a complete combination of einsteins general theory of relativity which is the theory of the

20278 :  but theres actually an even worse example of this kind of fine tuning of a dangerous number and this time it comes from the other

20279 :  one was einsteins theory of relativity the other was arguably even more revolutionary quantum

20280 :  the stakes now could not be higher

20281 :  this summer the lhc began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run

20282 :  two new ideas were turning the subject on its head

20283 :  this contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics and in the next few years we may find out whether

20284 :  but unlike the higgs field this number has no known explanation

20285 :  if dark energy were anywhere near this strong then the universe would have been torn apart stars and galaxies could

20286 :  but despite high hopes the lhc revealed a barren subatomic wilderness populated only by a lonely

20287 :  we cant access these other universes so theres no way of knowing whether theyre there or not

20288 :  it should either be off so that it has a zero value everywhere in space or it should be on so it has an

20289 :  a hundred years on we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics but whats at stake now is

20290 :  if so then we can continue this long journey that began one hundred years ago with albert einstein towards an ever

20291 :  but when we look around us we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff full of stars planets trees

20292 :  what theyre really planning to do is to build a machine that will study the higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues as to whether these

20293 :  its been estimated in fact that there are ten to the five hundred different versions of string theory

20294 :  so its only a good thing

20295 :  where does it go

20296 :  and i prepared well

20297 :  last year i was approached by the plastic oceans foundation who asked me not just to be a patron but also to

20298 :  i made it my mantra

20299 :  my last big project i was the best in the world

20300 :  its important to me to make eye contact with each and every one of them because they are the ones who allow me to go

20301 :  what was rumi trying to tell us

20302 :  the story the catholic church the son of god the mystery the ritual the rite the incense the whole thing loved it all

20303 :  everybody got one

20304 :  at least in berkshire county

20305 :  when i was a ehm

20306 :  what is he talking about

20307 :  do anything else do any number of things

20308 :  wore somebody elses clothes day after day after day after day

20309 :  when we try and live someone elses life have you ever tried that

20310 :  and i took my basket of chocolates and every single person i saw that day i said to them the thing i

20311 :  i dont care

20312 :  you have a duty to perform and yet if you do not do this one task your time here will have been wasted

20313 :  would you not

20314 :  and this woman in her mid 50s late 60s stood up and said from toronto stood up and said

20315 :  we dont necessarily move from all of those voices we choose the ones most wisely of course that we live from and

20316 :  you have a duty to perform

20317 :  and so by the time i was eight id screwed up my courage enough to go to the nuns and say the thing that had been in my heart

20318 :  when we are authentic we are freed up to create because we arent damped down

20319 :  we are going here we are going to talk directly to the scientist and were going to talk to other parents about what has to

20320 :  i know about obesity im a medical doctor but i also know something about the human condition and i can understand

20321 :  remember when you were six

20322 :  but if we do not want to smell we cannot close our noses because if we close our noses we cannot breathe

20323 :  it depends on a group of genes that regulate your immune system

20324 :  now you can say that what you are eating is not only sweet but a sweet peach flavored jelly

20325 :  a woman is walking down a dark deserted alleyway at two
20326 :  she needs to finish her paper before midnight

20327 :  and most importantly rape is not only between strangers

20328 :  she has a deadline to meet

20329 :  she left the nightclub early and shes walking by herself when out of the shadows emerges a large male figure

20330 :  raise your hands

20331 :  how many people in here think that they have an idea of what sexual assault is

20332 :  she says no

20333 :  its time to let go of that part of us that likes to suffer that likes to be a martyr in a cruel and

20334 :  fifteen in the morning

20335 :  we can say that no longer does our past dictate who we are as people today

20336 :  take for example zimbabwe

20337 :  they do things that most people think are impossible

20338 :  there is people doing amazing things we dont even know about

20339 :  in these pages he wrote the fundamental elemental phrase of western philosophy

20340 :  i let go and decided to ask the readers of my blog for advice and let them decide which job i would

20341 :  i get one hundred creative control

20342 :  it was my dream to be an actor i went to university to study theater and i didnt like being in plays with other people

20343 :  and then i actually read the notes

20344 :  i wanted to do my thing my way i gravitated towards doing one man shows

20345 :  and theres that web browser singing its siren song of temporarily relief in distraction and theres one thousand and one
20346 :  theyre all very simple and very basic

20347 :  i got good grades in school but i didnt like being there doing the same things as everybody else

20348 :  something barbara ehrenreich one of my favorite writers journalists author awesome person

20349 :  i am very individualistic

20350 :  its upped our productivity the quality of our writing and i can only imagine its going to keep going in this direction

20351 :  theres just me and the audience

20352 :  there goes that reaction again

20353 :  what can we do

20354 :  this is what i do now for a living

20355 :  writing is technology

20356 :  its a rare event

20357 :  we can choose to put our heads together and build on what we and others know

20358 :  what are you going to do

20359 :  its part of my process now

20360 :  i think thats something most of us know deep down

20361 :  it feels like theres a tug a war going on for the future

20362 :  more people than ever are willing to work as a team even with strangers to share even with strangers

20363 :  i always have been

20364 :  weve both spent at least some time looking at this issue we were emotionally invested in from a new point of view

20365 :  so now when im writing something for beams and struts ill work on it and work and work till i reach a point where the article

20366 :  anybody can use them in their lives whether theyre running a website or not

20367 :  working like this does not come naturally to me

20368 :  another theme week was about community and the most recent one was about women

20369 :  if i wanted to surf down a river of lava what would the surfboard need to be made out of

20370 :  were both listening and asking questions

20371 :  so the inner script is to defend my position no matter what facts are actually being exchanged

20372 :  lets see what a bunch of us can do that we couldnt do on our own

20373 :  and if theyre approaching with the same attitude then there is no dualistic winning and losing

20374 :  and we were listening

20375 :  there havent been that many technological paradigm shifts

20376 :  there is a growing tide of this out there in the digital age even though theres so much dualistic debating and instant gratification

20377 :  were extracting non renewable resources from the earth as fast as we can and who cares about the damage

20378 :  for that one we upped the engagement

20379 :  one of the members of the group referred to it as literary yoga

20380 :  i think its very fitting for a business school to teach people why organizations dont change

20381 :  in fact you have the machine down there

20382 :  have you seen how difficult that is how tough

20383 :  we like the new so much and sometimes we despise the old that we are unable to understand that the old still has

20384 :  now you understand by now that managing organizational forgetting is dealing with the metaphor

20385 :  like there is some machine that does that

20386 :  this is a happy pillow

20387 :  what is difficult is to keep doing over and over again

20388 :  thats the idea of client server

20389 :  that way you can actually increase the chances that your cars that your change efforts are going to have an

20390 :  i am a human being

20391 :  well i wasnt happy with that explanation

20392 :  things are just things

20393 :  organizations dont forget because they dont think

20394 :  there is a whole stream of thought that calls about the meta reality of things how the things that we use in fact

20395 :  i have a mind

20396 :  so what did i do in my spare time

20397 :  well its very hard to do that

20398 :  lets go into the stanford electronic medical record

20399 :  in fact its not traditionally done

20400 :  all those things conspired to give him a really good predictor

20401 :  he said well we have the bing searches

20402 :  he said russ i can predict with ninetythree percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose

20403 :  yes we can do pair wise a and b a and c a and d but what about a b

20404 :  we took mice and we gave them one p paroxetine

20405 :  and the final thing i want to say is in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story

20406 :  i dont do that

20407 :  five to one percent of all searches on the internet involve one of those words

20408 :  but the fda has made available an amazing database

20409 :  have they been studied with respect to their nine way interaction

20410 :  i said you know nick we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately and we dont have a

20411 :  in urination habits

20412 :  differences in fatigue

20413 :  but i still have six and a half minutes

20414 :  we need secure systems

20415 :  the two drugs actually caused problems

20416 :  they taught us how to feed mice drugs

20417 :  and theres a bunch of drugs not very exciting

20418 :  they increased glucose

20419 :  nick came back

20420 :  they studied it very carefully skeptically they approved it

20421 :  we submitted the paper

20422 :  but im sorry we still dont have a paper because this is ten patients and give me a break its not enough patients

20423 :  he did this in his phd for hundreds of pairs of drugs

20424 :  i thought you might say that so i did one other experiment

20425 :  i thought you might say that

20426 :  if people type in paroxetine or paxil those are synonyms and one of those words the rate goes

20427 :  they have a rough idea of how it works they have a rough idea of what the side effects are

20428 :  how do drugs work

20429 :  we could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way

20430 :  what do you do

20431 :  i said now youre talking

20432 :  you start to feel alive

20433 :  we have programs in place

20434 :  you start to feel a connection

20435 :  and so we step off the plane

20436 :  so the orders come from the top down

20437 :  yet you come back and everybodys saying youre a hero

20438 :  theres a stranger among us

20439 :  leadership is exhausting

20440 :  remember what clayton christensen pointed out in his brilliant book the innovators dilemma when you start

20441 :  thats what weve been talking about all day here today

20442 :  weve gotten some really great ideas on how we might do that

20443 :  what if we put employees into those markets not to sell anything right away per

20444 :  this was a brain that paid its dues

20445 :  uncover what id hint at if i could

20446 :  its really important for our music and our language

20447 :  the last chapter in any successful genocide is the one in which the oppressor can

20448 :  but to put that into perspective we estimate that eighty billion dollars a year is the cost that the

20449 :  we can create a new market that allows food that would have otherwise been wasted at the farm to be transferred from

20450 :  the scale of the market means that those that crack this issue are going to create tremendous value

20451 :  i first want to help you understand the issue of food waste but i want to talk about the opportunity to go

20452 :  we need to support that

20453 :  well again by knowing something about the molecular pathways it was possible to pick one of those many many

20454 :  wouldnt it be nice to be able to a test a drug to see if its effective and safe without having to

20455 :  if you dont believe me just ask sam

20456 :  how do we go faster

20457 :  thats the good news

20458 :  the payoff is enormous both in terms of health and in terms of economic growth

20459 :  you probably know if youve been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to

20460 :  it matters as soon as possible

20461 :  it matters for now

20462 :  but it took twentythree years to get this far

20463 :  and third and maybe most important we need talent

20464 :  only about two hundred and fifty
20465 :  this is the 21st century biology that youve been waiting for and we have the chance to take that

20466 :  now that im older and more mature i want to be a powerful voice in food advocacy for my

20467 :  if kids dont know they will choose a snack shack and panic over

20468 :  what youre looking at is the opium poppy

20469 :  its from this plant that we get many of our most effective pain medicines

20470 :  the third is that most of the people on this planet still to this day have insufficient access to medicines

20471 :  a black barbie

20472 :  which one is the ugly doll

20473 :  which one is the bad doll

20474 :  and she was on ellen

20475 :  is anyone familiar with that

20476 :  and its so funny because it was such a simple thing that helped me

20477 :  at a young age toys influence how we think how we act and how we see ourselves

20478 :  so taking all this information i had to figure out a way to take my skills as an artist and what i know about colorism and

20479 :  she got so much financial support

20480 :  in my research i came across the mamie clark doll test

20481 :  its pretty fun it makes it easier and it helps girls embrace their natural hair

20482 :  i started crying because to me it wasnt the real barbie because it wasnt the pretty barbie

20483 :  i learned a lot

20484 :  when our governments frame slums as threats in order to justify violent land grabs or forced evictions theyre counting on those

20485 :  the first act by salafi jihadi groups when they take over an area is to destroy

20486 :  ah youre a kenyan asian

20487 :  ive worked with one of those

20488 :  and then theyve got me mapped

20489 :  increased control mechanisms wont solve that problem

20490 :  the secret lies in what made lisa see our initial demonstration as political

20491 :  the person following can elect to take over the lead or the person leading can choose to surrender it essentially making it a

20492 :  in most mainstream international ballroom competitions same sex couples are rarely recognized on the floor and in many

20493 :  and then switch back

20494 :  this doesnt represent how we think today

20495 :  that makes the brain very hard to understand

20496 :  because our classical computers have to grow exponentially in size in order to

20497 :  and the other aspect is neuromorphic or cognitive computing

20498 :  so we think we can only go about a factor of sixteen denser in transistors on a chip

20499 :  people dont care if is you or the next person they just want it done

20500 :  and reviewers wanted me to comment on ideas that were important to me

20501 :  over and over again day after day like real responsible grown up adult

20502 :  so i started to wonder

20503 :  and that i was receiving an award for chemistry of all things

20504 :  so instead i was using a pilot protein called lysozyme

20505 :  i loved learning about the body systems and how they worked

20506 :  i still didnt know

20507 :  because id broken the machine

20508 :  this research topic was concerned with designing new drugs for cancer treatment

20509 :  as soon as two months later i was being flown to california to work in gregs lab

20510 :  i was convinced the only reason we could be seeing these results was because of me the novice

20511 :  i needed to understand chemistry to understand a fantastic new machine that my supervisor a

20512 :  he tried the marketing solution which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable and none but the royal family could consume it

20513 :  its held every two years in burma

20514 :  i dont know if anybody knows it

20515 :  so they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display and increase the kind of third party enjoyment

20516 :  here is my naive advertising mans suggestion

20517 :  it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past

20518 :  so he tried plan b

20519 :  there is some evidence by the way that things like social networking help do that

20520 :  im just an ad man

20521 :  if you think about it if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods you basically have two

20522 :  this actually had symbolic value badge value

20523 :  you start with twelve and they take them away

20524 :  but for a city to grow in the right place it is necessary for governments to be able to decide

20525 :  they are all always public have public access and have good pedestrian infrastructure so that

20526 :  inside the mall one doesnt even know if its day or night

20527 :  the high income person goes to a large home with access to gardens with access to vacations

20528 :  i do not think so

20529 :  im a social woker whats your super power

20530 :  whats your super power

20531 :  whos organizing the community

20532 :  or figure out how to pay those huge hospital bills

20533 :  well one year she had a young woman she assigned him to a client named

20534 :  then theres the bigger picture

20535 :  the two biggest things

20536 :  hanny is my name and voorwerp is the slightly boring word for object

20537 :  its about six hundred and fifty million light years from earth

20538 :  it was the former though they checked the area and it was actually there

20539 :  now shes the fastest typist she knows

20540 :  theyre not as true as they could be

20541 :  and when i started designing i discovered an odd thing about myself

20542 :  but what i love and im a journalist and what i love is finding hidden patterns i love being a data detective

20543 :  and ive never been to design school

20544 :  how much of this diagram do you think might be taken up by the debt that africa owes to the west

20545 :  and then i write about it on my blog so im telling people heres how you grow a tomato and then im

20546 :  and can this generation of people redefine the publics relationship with the art

20547 :  gradually people have begun to pick up the fragments bending and twisting in their own unique

20548 :  is this still the case

20549 :  help people within these cooperations to look out their windows and

20550 :  what is the purpose of accountancy today

20551 :  yes because most company founders had a very strong belief and will to

20552 :  like am i into this

20553 :  and you go to one of these conventions and some dude built the titanic

20554 :  but its a loan so youll have to pay it back

20555 :  and when i turned twentyone i decided that wanted to move back to ny city and i wanted to work towards getting my college

20556 :  ill loan you the money if you want to take it

20557 :  why do you need the money

20558 :  wheres it going

20559 :  my dad said put together a proposal for me

20560 :  primary sugar in it

20561 :  its in your soup

20562 :  but in actuality our school got a fab lab through a grant provided by

20563 :  he questioned how i was going to make it

20564 :  were not asking important questions

20565 :  i was also a curious economics major as an undergrad

20566 :  were spending ten billion dollars on the census

20567 :  so as i spent time with leaders in the gnh movement i got to really understand what theyre doing

20568 :  were asking ten simple questions it is simplicity

20569 :  and focused with gross domestic product

20570 :  so this is my idea worth spreading

20571 :  and the healthy diet is one that is fresh high in fruits and vegetables

20572 :  when people get well they get well across the board not only in the symptoms that we treated

20573 :  his research showed that you could reduce the mortality rates from septicemia from

20574 :  near and far people gave their dollars they gave their cents they gave their hearts

20575 :  one to feel so overwhelmed or unqualified we do nothing

20576 :  i ask the world to end suffering but do i show up for those who are suffering on my street corner

20577 :  start by having the first conversation at your own kitchen table

20578 :  ask is this fair

20579 :  what should i do

20580 :  she did not say im not a congressman or the president of the united states so how could i possibly

20581 :  i dont need a plastic bag

20582 :  peace cannot be shared or created with others if we cannot first generate it

20583 :  so other things right

20584 :  just do a logo make a contribution and then youre out and you feel really good about yourself

20585 :  meet you after school down at owl

20586 :  let me know if you have any problem with that

20587 :  i thought it was just like a saying but it actually exists i guess

20588 :  thats where the heart and soul of the school is

20589 :  i like that right

20590 :  they were tired of them

20591 :  i was just focused on a foot ahead of me as far as i could reach with my own hands

20592 :  and then look at this

20593 :  it just was the greatest thing

20594 :  thats where the books are

20595 :  and i said no

20596 :  so really nice having you here

20597 :  im going to try to push it inside your hand

20598 :  bring them out check and see how accurate you were

20599 :  make your best guess

20600 :  what color is my shirt

20601 :  if i did it slowly itd be on your shoulder

20602 :  this tricks more about the timing

20603 :  were just shopping

20604 :  hopefully it matches his taste

20605 :  even more than that what about predicting human behavior

20606 :  put your hand up a little bit higher but watch it close

20607 :  if i come down im going to do a bit of shopping

20608 :  but its only a start

20609 :  for me i like to think of it very simple like a surveillance system

20610 :  do you have a wallet

20611 :  if you dont attend to something you cant be aware of it

20612 :  what just happened

20613 :  dont run away

20614 :  heres the other problem with that

20615 :  its no wonder thats a part of why we give

20616 :  i realized as i thought about that this is a fundamental part of human nature

20617 :  its within our nature to seek stories and inspirations

20618 :  what kind of impact would that have had

20619 :  theyre just brilliant

20620 :  but the bigger principle of whats happening behind stack overflow i think is incredibly exciting

20621 :  i think taskrabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids

20622 :  how do we mimic the way trust is built face to face online

20623 :  people are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has

20624 :  just because sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble ikea furniture

20625 :  theyre just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the facebook age

20626 :  its an engineers dream to work with that group of people

20627 :  and i also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at google both for supporting me during this effort

20628 :  we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the cape

20629 :  for somebody like me watching people wave around their negative nra

20630 :  you know they say that the internet democratizes information

20631 :  i meet so many of these parents its the most heartbreaking part of my job

20632 :  well they want to hunt

20633 :  and you know what

20634 :  they love their guns

20635 :  what do hunters want

20636 :  and so i had this brilliant plan for the midterm

20637 :  have you met my ex

20638 :  one of the families i interviewed tom and karen robards were taken aback when as young and

20639 :  those hearing parents tend to try to cure them

20640 :  we were sitting in the kitchen

20641 :  and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity

20642 :  two beers for them is four beers for him

20643 :  and i dont accept subtractive models of love only additive ones

20644 :  and i suddenly thought most deaf children are born to hearing parents

20645 :  and i was rather taken aback

20646 :  in so far as he was extending them he was doing so asymmetrically which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some

20647 :  and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family

20648 :  and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame retardant pajamas in an inferno

20649 :  and even though she didnt have a lot of educational or financial advantages she found the best doctor in the country for

20650 :  but speaking for myself well i would never have believed twentythree years ago when he was born that i could

20651 :  and karen robards said to me im with tom

20652 :  and i wanted also to protect myself from illness

20653 :  i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness

20654 :  this is what we hear when you pray for a cure that your fondest wish for us is that someday we

20655 :  in the time since that atlantic monthly story ran the life expectancy for people with down syndrome

20656 :  and i believe in both of them

20657 :  i said im gay

20658 :  if i hadnt gone to ohio state and crossed paths with tom this child wouldnt have existed and this terrible thing

20659 :  and yet i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing

20660 :  this is what we hear when you mourn over our existence

20661 :  but i think its a tragedy when one of them doesnt see the other

20662 :  and he had a very large head which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus

20663 :  she said i knew i couldnt go in there and interrupt him but i went home and i left him eight messages on his cell phone

20664 :  and the first weekend i spent with them the first of many i recorded more than twenty hours of conversation

20665 :  do you wish your child didnt have down syndrome

20666 :  and like all parents since the dawn of time i wanted to protect my child from illness

20667 :  and many people were astonished and said but how can you decide to have children in the midst of

20668 :  because i realized that this representation of the human drama was always about men and

20669 :  the printing press made sure that everybody saw it

20670 :  choirs of angels

20671 :  but genius rose to the challenge

20672 :  thats where it all came about and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art

20673 :  he focused on the act of creation

20674 :  and he had been left with a commission to paint twelve apostles against a decorative background in the sistine chapel

20675 :  so i was walking around the parking lot i was crying i was sobbing im not going to lie im not good at a lot of things

20676 :  and my magnum opus was this thing called the andes mint milkshake

20677 :  he could say

20678 :  i think my favorite one is about a friend who took a trip to panama

20679 :  we both have schedules this is our weekend and other people want our time too

20680 :  so im here to find another topic and im going to call it intentional conversation

20681 :  i mean im in college hes in college

20682 :  now that played itself out in the world cup campaign

20683 :  they set them up as what they called micro distribution centers and those local entrepreneurs then hire

20684 :  well theyre already starting talk about this

20685 :  its a lot like other consumer companies

20686 :  they learn something they put it back into the product they put it back into the market

20687 :  but they localize it

20688 :  cokes global campaign slogan is open happiness

20689 :  the g8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last twenty years but were starting to have

20690 :  and im happy to say only one other person in that area got polio

20691 :  they have a whole team called knowledge and insight

20692 :  lets listen to this song that coke created for it wavin flag by a somali hip hop artist

20693 :  and you said what message are you talking about

20694 :  but social is not an app

20695 :  but through the application of aquaponics programs in prison we are starting to see some of these cycles

20696 :  poetry is the art of trying to say something with words that cannot be said in words

20697 :  while mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel

20698 :  one of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us

20699 :  was i able to live as a coward like everyone else or was i going to make a stand

20700 :  what that meant that if you stayed out of trouble youre going to stay alive

20701 :  ten months later i quit my job

20702 :  youre also paying for them to be creative

20703 :  defined by your stamina so your ability to run the marathon not the

20704 :  thank god they did that because piece by piece i started getting a little bit of myself back

20705 :  its not a permanent condition

20706 :  they inspired me so much that i decided to put my money where my mouth is

20707 :  she speaks about grit

20708 :  i was at this point in my life where i had to make a decision

20709 :  we dont want to go blind because theres too many possibilities and there is not too much lab and

20710 :  and we didnt have the evidence for that

20711 :  in fact im borrowing here from one of those very popular books of the time

20712 :  lets think of life as that entire planet because in a sense it is

20713 :  and here begins four hundred years of frustration of

20714 :  what about the idea of the plurality of the worlds about life on other planets

20715 :  could we have it

20716 :  and who wins by this

20717 :  and all of these drugs were moved forward based on positive results in mouse models

20718 :  and we take that information and put it back into the human experience

20719 :  i just ran and ran and ran

20720 :  there has to be somewhere where i can fit in and belong even if the stigma followed me

20721 :  pretty soon my parents got annoyed with driving back and forth and i had to go back to my old catholic school

20722 :  i thought for sure i would be able to find at least one social group out of two thousand kids

20723 :  i thought this was a minor upset in elementary school and i thought things would get better into middle school

20724 :  thats not me

20725 :  when will i get stopped

20726 :  you can be anything

20727 :  but unfortunately i have to inform you that in two thousand and seven a very inspired nyu ph

20728 :  if theres a takeaway to this talk i hope its that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the

20729 :  but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am

20730 :  student counted all the models on the runway every single one that was hired and of the

20731 :  this is what i tried to do

20732 :  im talking about at home too

20733 :  document document document

20734 :  i needed the money

20735 :  this is what didnt work

20736 :  and the most important relationship is with ourselves learning to value ourselves

20737 :  i was a single mom

20738 :  why do people stay

20739 :  and i want to emphasize

20740 :  if you are in charge of people risking their lives in service cops soldiers fire fighters

20741 :  push to change current policies and laws

20742 :  and if you do find out you might be alarmed to learn this policy is against your wishes whatever that wish may

20743 :  why should we ignore those ones or treat those identities worse

20744 :  so that night we got together and walked into that bar

20745 :  but i was one of the lucky ones

20746 :  i got a job working in the field of advertising

20747 :  he signed an executive order basically making it illegal to work for the federal government if you were a homosexual

20748 :  they taught me how to answer questions about hiv and aids they taught me how to advocate for

20749 :  i mean i do remember that my home state of wisconsin became the first state in the nation to offer

20750 :  i took them to everyone everywhere i possibly could

20751 :  i mean is that going to happen

20752 :  once i said those words to myself quite frankly there was no shutting me up

20753 :  in my lifetime

20754 :  is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed

20755 :  go up aaleh

20756 :  and theyll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own

20757 :  cyrus king of the persians has entered babylon without a fight the great empire of babylon

20758 :  so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together as weve been doing

20759 :  and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a

20760 :  so the hyperbole is not actually surprising

20761 :  the right of peoples to live together in the same state worshiping differently freely a

20762 :  its story we all know

20763 :  in fact thats the job of laughter

20764 :  thats the bewildering start of being a baby

20765 :  were used to talking about stars

20766 :  when alex pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have

20767 :  and what happened was exactly what youd expect that some groups were very much more successful than others

20768 :  i was considered impure and forbidden from worshipping or touching any object of religious

20769 :  he was gone

20770 :  hes a cool cowboy with a great last name

20771 :  so i got to the arena early in the morning the day of the show waiting out in the parking lot to see if i could spot some wrestlers

20772 :  my one son hes a whiz at electronics

20773 :  and turning myself up made me unforgettable to the fans

20774 :  id be hilarious from the moment i walked into the arena

20775 :  if youve ever lost someone you know what a difficult time that can be

20776 :  man they would just punch and kick me hard

20777 :  im trying to teach my children that turning yourself up is just not some perfect idea of how to be great its a way of

20778 :  i left the ring but gator stayed with me and i use the turned up version of myself every day

20779 :  with every wrestling match i dug deeper

20780 :  one of the wrestlers whod been on the scene a long time knew what i was going through and he came over to see how i was holding up

20781 :  so i committed to the idea that my character wasnt going to be as scary as some of the others

20782 :  i found out that once someone has been turned up its pretty hard to turn them down

20783 :  should we meet now

20784 :  lets not be

20785 :  our democracies are weakened in the global economy with players that can evade laws evade taxes

20786 :  yet i have come to believe that the problem is not so much one of economics as it is one of

20787 :  we really could sense that there was going to be a major progressive change in greece

20788 :  every technology advances

20789 :  but id like to ask you how would you tell the time if you didnt have an iphone

20790 :  he would not only know what time it was he would also know where the sun would rise and how it

20791 :  they are just incredibly expensive

20792 :  astrolabes have an incredible history

20793 :  how would you tell the time say six hundred years ago

20794 :  and astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together and also how

20795 :  but what we lose i think is an accurate a felt sense of the sky a sense of

20796 :  every technology is transformed and moved by others

20797 :  how would you do it

20798 :  and what we gain with a new technology of course is precision and accuracy

20799 :  awful things will happen in this century im absolutely sure

20800 :  so the gains from trade are only going to grow

20801 :  how long is it going to take you

20802 :  with language we have to transfer ideas that we understand with each other

20803 :  in this case chimpanzees teaching each other how to crack nuts with rocks

20804 :  theyre both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree

20805 :  there will be wars there will be depressions there will be natural disasters

20806 :  quite a long time

20807 :  and thats what weve done because were all working for each other

20808 :  theyre always made from local chert

20809 :  homo erectus made the same tool for thirty thousand generations

20810 :  they were imaginative

20811 :  per capita food production is up by a third

20812 :  for example in the caucasus theres a site where you find local neanderthal tools

20813 :  and this is not as far fetched as it seems

20814 :  and thats true

20815 :  whatever the cause we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals

20816 :  my colleagues and i in cura ao are interested in looking forward at what might be

20817 :  is my son a genius

20818 :  what we are saying about knowledge

20819 :  so when feminists say as they have been for centuries are women human

20820 :  and for one year still everyday i get messages from women who say everyday in my

20821 :  they are swirling in chaos

20822 :  their heads are swirling in chaos

20823 :  it s more a matter of how integrated the teaching staff maybe

20824 :  both my great grandmother who had no social construction to help her understand her life and i were

20825 :  fathers show up

20826 :  so i didnt do any of that

20827 :  and so the first thing i would say is

20828 :  is my son smart

20829 :  we need them to be interacting with both boys and girls whether it is a sex segregated school or not

20830 :  don t bite your tongue

20831 :  they ask a lot of questions

20832 :  but we have different expectations and those biases affect the way parents and teachers interact with boys and

20833 :  that has to go into schools

20834 :  that sends a very strong message to children

20835 :  and they do the outside things like build cabins on special days

20836 :  and you have that power too

20837 :  and next to them was an empty mens room

20838 :  we re supposed to be quiet

20839 :  and that s important

20840 :  is my daughter pretty

20841 :  where are they

20842 :  half an hour later she wasnt back

20843 :  this is what we re talking about

20844 :  we need them to be setting examples in schools

20845 :  and we have an interesting listener bias

20846 :  you have to laugh right

20847 :  and when you teach manners don t have those manners be about ladies and gentlemen

20848 :  everybody says that feminists don t have a sense of humor

20849 :  and all of that is tied to whether we can be knowers

20850 :  and what they re saying to girls and boys is very different

20851 :  so the dynamic that i am talking about it may be that in your own home there s a chore gap

20852 :  so the last thing i would tell you is i am here telling her story which is a huge change in the last fifty
20853 :  it doesn t acquire that you build an institution as wonderful as the institutions are

20854 :  i had to apologize to the people i had hurt

20855 :  youve already given enough brother

20856 :  i spent five years interviewing photographing and filming nurses for a book and a

20857 :  and that propelled bridget to go into the profession of nursing

20858 :  we talked about her boyfriends we talked about looking for apartments in new york city and we talked about my

20859 :  i went to my first day of chemotherapy and i was an emotional wreck

20860 :  he talked about his experience of being a nurse in germany and taking care of the soldiers coming right

20861 :  we live in a complicated time when it comes to our health care

20862 :  i wasnt going to be able to pretend anymore as though everything was normal

20863 :  joanne made me feel normal for the first time in six months

20864 :  but then my chemo was scheduled to begin and that terrified me because i knew that i was going to

20865 :  i had a port installed in my chest

20866 :  and before we left she went into the room of a dying patient

20867 :  until recently sleep problems that occurred in the context of major life stress or medical or

20868 :  well the evidence is in and the results are clear

20869 :  so this is a virus based solar cell

20870 :  so i stayed up at night and talked to my husband how do i give president obama a periodic table

20871 :  and you flip it over and its the amino acids with the ph at which they have different charges

20872 :  and so i give this out to thousands of people

20873 :  now youre in your element

20874 :  so the basic idea of i

20875 :  i knew them both

20876 :  com and symbolics

20877 :  and now that a community project there a grassroots project has provided them with

20878 :  before they were walking up to 10km a day for water

20879 :  how do you cope with that

20880 :  and so how am i gonna fit one more thing and something i am not even an expert in

20881 :  maybe ill continue researching

20882 :  and thats where enters another part

20883 :  but i only found more gaps because i wanted to understand why there is one stuff which is red and

20884 :  that word i dont know

20885 :  i was healthy once more

20886 :  thank you very much

20887 :  we dont need a reason

20888 :  maybe she had been dared to do this

20889 :  and were never given a reason why we should play

20890 :  they did this project a couple years ago where they asked people a question about art

20891 :  the same people did both of these activities

20892 :  and the reason they interacted differently was because of the design and the tools that were given to them

20893 :  we are going to embrace it

20894 :  theyre passionate about the things that we protect and yet werent staying at arms length

20895 :  county museum of art

20896 :  this is from the l

20897 :  what is that about

20898 :  this is somebody who is going to get more involved

20899 :  you dont have to be a professional to be excited about culture today

20900 :  so again at our museum we think really carefully about how to bring to life the conversations that can happen

20901 :  and from there i can make better choices about how to build market and monetize our game

20902 :  and that is where i think videogames can really shine

20903 :  and that painted a really clear picture for me

20904 :  and foldit is really more of a puzzle game

20905 :  or a more poignant example is the

20906 :  whos your market

20907 :  you have this innate knowledge of it

20908 :  thank you power station

20909 :  thank you steel mill

20910 :  and then i put the really tough question how many of you hand wash your jeans and your bed

20911 :  what is special with this

20912 :  because it remains hard work for women to wash

20913 :  that would be awesome and we could just concentrate all our efforts there

20914 :  and i think this is partly where there is such a divide of opinion that theres a lot of people in this room and around the world who

20915 :  its the bringer of knowledge to all

20916 :  its who they wrote to and when and so forth

20917 :  but its been argued and someone here in the audience has talked to a former nsa analyst who

20918 :  what did you make of it

20919 :  is there such a right

20920 :  otherwise if we could make it so that all the bad guys used one corner of the internet we could have a domain badguy

20921 :  its not necessarily the actual words that someone has written in an email or given on a phone call

20922 :  you had a follow on a week later to a qatari company

20923 :  i offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading

20924 :  so i think absolutely folks do have a right to privacy and that we work very hard to make sure

20925 :  is there anything to that

20926 :  its certainly quite a strong statement that the nsa is willing to reach out and show a more open

20927 :  the government you others in terms of putting things right and helping figure out a smarter policy a smarter

20928 :  he didnt come over like a crazy man

20929 :  do you still think that

20930 :  the alternative to that is one thats much less efficient and much more invasive of privacy which is gigantic amounts

20931 :  we have the responsibility to think about the ways we talk about gender

20932 :  i really do have a four
20933 :  b replies were only on the second floor

20934 :  my name is sarah and everything pertaining to that joke relates to me

20935 :  you have this idea of google x

20936 :  you learn that the balloons are possible because theres some material that will work for them

20937 :  give me a sense of the philosophy of your own mind

20938 :  it has to do with languages

20939 :  its great to hear from you and a pleasure to sit at this table with you

20940 :  cr it is great to see you here

20941 :  it is security and privacy

20942 :  now thats an important concept

20943 :  and how is my breath

20944 :  so i like to do this prayer called dhikr which involves the repetition of

20945 :  and it didnt subside until i was able to name it i was able to describe it i was able to

20946 :  runners on the other hand didnt notice it

20947 :  as it turns out our society cant make up its mind

20948 :  okay so that wasnt so simple

20949 :  as i walked i felt like the asymmetrical trees bent a

20950 :  so what i did instead is i took the average of the stories of many sensitive people and

20951 :  and so we got underway on that and then im sitting on my couch in two thousand and eight
20952 :  and say labor is cheap land is cheap

20953 :  well put them on mobile shelving

20954 :  did you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory actually found their way inside that box in the

20955 :  they couldnt believe they really did think she was magic how she achieved this

20956 :  this was just because her feet were incredibly strong

20957 :  its extraordinary now how much rehearsing we do

20958 :  its always guys that look pretty much like me flying from countries that look pretty much like this to other

20959 :  now try and wrap your head around that for a second

20960 :  you just had teams of hundreds of people

20961 :  while i was thinking about it people started using even more things like this just as we were

20962 :  now we knew when we built this system the whole point of it just like with the palmpilots was that youd be

20963 :  sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer and sometimes actually not infrequently

20964 :  we dont know and this is really amazing to me we dont know how many children were born or

20965 :  now one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfive obviously that was quite a long time ago

20966 :  i need to think about this more

20967 :  so these guys are distributing technology getting software capacity out there but theyre not actually flying around the world

20968 :  we have paper forms to track people who come into clinics

20969 :  and you go out there and you spend money on airfare and you spend time and you spend per diem and you

20970 :  thats less than i used to get just traveling out for two weeks to do a consultation

20971 :  and what theyre talking about is all of the information that were generating through our interaction with and over the internet

20972 :  and so i began to rack my brain trying to think about what was the process that i was doing

20973 :  how was i training folks and what were the bottlenecks and what were the obstacles to doing it faster and to

20974 :  as far as i knew that was the only way you could distribute technology and i couldnt figure out a way around it

20975 :  and this school named after the u

20976 :  we love you

20977 :  youre going to write the next chapter in history

20978 :  the men in my life taught me some important things as well

20979 :  thank you so much

20980 :  but when we met barack was a community organizer

20981 :  during my visit ive been especially honored to meet some of britains most extraordinary women

20982 :  i lost my face

20983 :  and i also whistled at a christmas eve party with my family in law

20984 :  but it can also sound like this

20985 :  i whistled alone i whistled in the classroom i whistled on bike i whistled everywhere

20986 :  but the truth is florence e

20987 :  my favorite view

20988 :  the rail beneath which the two rivers crashed together in a sense creating

20989 :  always look a person in the eye

20990 :  when i would hear other people say

20991 :  and when i looked around i began to see what my truth really was

20992 :  because all i knew growing up was that my dad loved my grandpa and grandpa loved

20993 :  how did you adapt

20994 :  some of you may remember the kodak moment but that really was just a moment in time because

20995 :  how to tackle homophobia

20996 :  it removes carbon dioxide from the air

20997 :  in fact you get more bang for your buck

20998 :  how does that work

20999 :  and those last ten miles id told her before dont listen to me anything you i tell you you tell me to run

21000 :  and then when i build on top of that im able to do that much more

21001 :  and we ran really well for the next ten miles and then the reality of what id done to myself set in

21002 :  and that unknown is pretty amazing

21003 :  i kept going with them so i saw how i react in the world

21004 :  and when we hit the bottom of the trail and the trail opened up to the road and i could see the shops of chamonix

21005 :  im an ultra distance trail runner

21006 :  it is through art that we can really tell our own story

21007 :  i experience this all the time where you know people have a lot of expectations religious ones and cultural

21008 :  thank you very much

21009 :  one of them actually fittingly enough found me when i checked into a deli at a

21010 :  now to be clear im a journalist and not a technologist so what id like to do briefly is paint a picture of what

21011 :  now were already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile

21012 :  and i think thats going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists

21013 :  all available measures

21014 :  then you are given a prescription medication by your doctor which you have to purchase yourself and then you have to self administer the drug

21015 :  employees had to walk through metal detectors and when leaving receive pat downs to make sure they

21016 :  in order for westwood to change it had to be owned by the people so we developed a resident led approach

21017 :  what should it look like

21018 :  you made the right call im listening very carefully

21019 :  and then on top of that you have a steady stream of visitors and volunteers coming in showering you in the

21020 :  how cool is that

21021 :  and analogs are one of the ways we do this

21022 :  so we went out to test these hypotheses about how to actually work at the asteroid

21023 :  so now the question becomes

21024 :  thats left for another analog

21025 :  you know nasa is planning to go to the surface of a body somewhere in our solar system

21026 :  so why do we use analogs

21027 :  jet packs right

21028 :  so then we tried the jet packs

21029 :  that mass of that vehicle would hold us in place

21030 :  if we were working with another crew member they could look out for both of us at the same time

21031 :  so i would like to tell you about an analog that i participated in with nasa

21032 :  so however cool they were we realized that maybe jet packs are only good for a safety measure

21033 :  have you put it into place or is it just written up in a document

21034 :  but theyll have individual learning that theyll take away on areas where they need to improve to

21035 :  consider running an authentic drill to see if your ten year old is really ready to help you if you are

21036 :  you may want to consider an analog

21037 :  i was ruthless about it and the result was awesome

21038 :  how i came to believe otherwise has been an eye opening experience

21039 :  my bedroom walls werent going to magically expand

21040 :  whats more my stuff was limited on that semester

21041 :  i was a child of the 80s and 90s

21042 :  so once the city schooled me in the fine art of dressing the decluttering extended to my

21043 :  i had to create space within the confines i was given and it was a small bedroom packed with

21044 :  so i just want to ask two things of you before i wrap up

21045 :  gone were the days of hemming and hawing in front of a mirror wondering if i looked ok

21046 :  i wanted more of all of it

21047 :  the 1950s era supermarket contained three thousand different items but by the

21048 :  were back where we were in the 1970s

21049 :  people react to these middle school years in many different ways

21050 :  i was undermined and i was miserable about myself but the one thing i did have was an entrepreneurial spirit i had

21051 :  i felt like i was in a dark hole that was getting worse and worse as each day went by

21052 :  they have their clique

21053 :  they have great grades

21054 :  i was the girl who struggled academically due to many learning differences even though i would try so

21055 :  and some people play it cool

21056 :  for many of us its the toughest years of our lives

21057 :  take those lemons and make the most killer lemonade you can

21058 :  you cant avoid it

21059 :  theyre happy and theyll show it

21060 :  they have trouble in school they cant find their group of friends and they go within their own bubble

21061 :  for some girls pubertys in their favor

21062 :  let this be a cautionary tale for you

21063 :  i went to the place where he sleeps

21064 :  he said to me its late notice so we wont be able to pay you and he walked out

21065 :  can you cover his shift tomorrow

21066 :  no other species can do that

21067 :  you couldnt do healthy people

21068 :  and now we have a new experimental prep human beings

21069 :  and we steal their games

21070 :  why is that

21071 :  everyone is interested in other people

21072 :  this has literally revolutionized cognitive science

21073 :  drugs of abuse would come in and they would change the way you value the world

21074 :  everyone has relationships with other people and theyre interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons

21075 :  the other area is called behavioral economics

21076 :  they keep you alive

21077 :  its in its early stages and its crude by some measures but in fact twenty years ago we were at nothing

21078 :  that is we exploit the fact that the healthy partner playing somebody with major depression or playing

21079 :  and we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior

21080 :  okay so what

21081 :  thats an unfair offer and you know what an unfair offer is

21082 :  heres the cool thing

21083 :  it was at the time in houston texas

21084 :  this is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world

21085 :  these same valuation systems are redeployed when were valuing interactions with other people

21086 :  but i never found that really super insightful

21087 :  they have five

21088 :  beginning middle and end

21089 :  tapirs do not eat ants

21090 :  and i told you roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the cerrado so we just came up with the idea

21091 :  the world is facing so many different conservation crises

21092 :  the robot is the same lamp that you saw and i put two brains in it

21093 :  we didnt have to communicate verbally about this it all just happened

21094 :  you have to use your sense memory to reconstruct the emotions and kind of think with your body to find

21095 :  everybodys riffing off each other nobody is stopping for a moment

21096 :  so i tried to make a robot that doesnt actually know what its doing but is still doing it

21097 :  it was after a passover seder

21098 :  so if you want to find the right motion for a character dont think about it go use your body to find it

21099 :  maybe it can make for better robotic teammates

21100 :  and this came at the same time as i was reading about this trend in cognitive psychology called embodied cognition

21101 :  lets call it the adventurous brain

21102 :  the other got more the stage actor risk taker brain

21103 :  and in that situation we can easily imagine robots in the near future being there with us

21104 :  he actually did the weasel in ice age

21105 :  lets call it the calculated brain

21106 :  why was i sticking my head above the parapet

21107 :  in the past nine months the question ive been asked the most is why

21108 :  a third party app which snapchatters use to preserve the lifespan of the messages was

21109 :  weve seen that to be true with racism homophobia and plenty of other biases today and in the

21110 :  unlike me though your boss probably wasnt the president of the united states of america

21111 :  where is all this money going

21112 :  what we spend on looking after patients with cancer in the world one hundred and seventy
21113 :  her breast is also replaced by cancer shrunken and small

21114 :  its called the five eighty paradox

21115 :  so the magic bullet kills the cancer and leaves you unaffected without any side effects but of

21116 :  target them educate them give them the tools they need to avoid the cancers to get vaccinations

21117 :  what about whats happening in the rest of the world

21118 :  add them all together and this is about what you get

21119 :  about how much did we spend on the rio olympics this year

21120 :  weve chatted already today about how very difficult it is to change behaviors

21121 :  why does it cost so much

21122 :  so these are estimates of the impact these programs will have but if successful and if the hpv

21123 :  only five of the resources that are going into oncology are being spent in the parts of the

21124 :  its a lot of money

21125 :  six billion to make

21126 :  smoking is linked to more than fifteen cancers and single handedly contributes to the formation

21127 :  around about ninetythree billion

21128 :  shes having a mammogram and were detecting an asymptomatic cancer at a stage were able to cure

21129 :  well the pharma companies will say my sexy drug was really expensive to make

21130 :  overall its a resoundingly good success story

21131 :  simply by happy happenstance youre living in ireland

21132 :  target the groups that need it most

21133 :  helicobacter pylori its a little bug endemic in some areas that causes stomach cancer

21134 :  very often were detecting something that a patient cant feel

21135 :  this is the under five mortality rate

21136 :  weve got to change approaches and cultures around alcohol yes banning sports advertising for alcohol

21137 :  cancer is a disease of the aging

21138 :  but this is how breast cancer presents in the rest of the world

21139 :  and thats true

21140 :  itll be very hard to stop them from smoking if they start it at eighteen nineteen twenty
21141 :  the sex workers health workers who are exposed to blood products intravenous drug abusers

21142 :  there are great vaccinations available for both hepatitis b and also human papilloma virus

21143 :  it gave you everything you wanted from rahm emanuel particularly in the expletive

21144 :  it was also twitter as a production mechanism

21145 :  they are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium

21146 :  these three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives

21147 :  it was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving

21148 :  it was mayor emanuel

21149 :  you look at something like west wing twitter in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world

21150 :  you could tune in to a short story from the new yorkers fiction account

21151 :  think about episodes that happened live on radio

21152 :  odd little fact

21153 :  if you want to see a snowy owl my favorite bird when growing up if you want to see a snowy owl head up to

21154 :  one of the most common birds

21155 :  but im here to dispel myths about birding and to show you how you too can join in

21156 :  use everything youve got

21157 :  human beings have the ability to accumulate data preserve it write it down and

21158 :  i wanted moses to know

21159 :  because he is a human being

21160 :  i was telling a story to myself because i wanted to believe in it

21161 :  why bother tell me

21162 :  no court dates

21163 :  how could you want to be here

21164 :  generate buzz through social media

21165 :  think about something in your hometown right now thats always bothered you

21166 :  they all thought i was some crazy sixth grader

21167 :  and it was at that moment that my second identity was born

21168 :  it doesnt matter how you express yourself just that you do it with passion and that its in your own unique voice in

21169 :  and i did this for months but nobody would respond to me

21170 :  because what ive started learning with the stuff that ive been doing is if you work really hard to create something interesting and

21171 :  but you are a very weak person

21172 :  i will never forget the first time that i ever tried this in a show

21173 :  so i decided to start telling my story

21174 :  why are you here

21175 :  then we would have freak shows now we have reality tv

21176 :  a lot of people do not realise that they are suffering and that was exactly the same for me

21177 :  i want to talk about it so that we can help sufferers

21178 :  talk about empty calories

21179 :  it was a difficult show to write

21180 :  they went and sought help in the church they tried to drag me along

21181 :  six million people in the uk that suffer with eating disorders

21182 :  i was going nowhere near that place

21183 :  were coming down taking a chance on doing something in two weeks

21184 :  so i got all of these stories from him

21185 :  in many oppressive states the media is just a tool for government propaganda

21186 :  it had no danger of turning into that country

21187 :  will it be the same as it was there

21188 :  no economy can grow that fast safely

21189 :  then it was because latvia was struggling for independence and the faith of the soviet union hang in the balance

21190 :  the crash was inevitable

21191 :  this is walnut creek which runs right in front of walmart in windsor heights if you folks are familiar with it

21192 :  this is a picture we took this week as well

21193 :  so we need to get that stuff out of the rivers and also make our riverbanks better

21194 :  but you cant be just creative

21195 :  and we all know what belonging is correlated with

21196 :  how can we keep ourselves to our promise of constantly reimagining education

21197 :  and so in many ways i believe that the next big quantum leap in science

21198 :  and i didnt check facebook

21199 :  i still barely understand what most scientists are talking about

21200 :  now am i saying oh well great prevention strategy

21201 :  now the corkscrew is a chicane followed by a quick right handed turn as the road drops three stories

21202 :  theyre able to go out and consistently do this pushing the car to the limits every single

21203 :  or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere

21204 :  but in fact theres something else that weve developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars

21205 :  well theres two really good reasons for this

21206 :  now we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track so we headed down south to laguna seca

21207 :  now we can measure this and we can look at the relative power between the theta waves and the alpha waves

21208 :  you were tired but you felt you could drive a few more miles

21209 :  and johns going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out

21210 :  you see weve been developing robotic race cars cars that can actually push themselves to the

21211 :  im going to take you around now to the other side of the track

21212 :  i dont have time to go into each of them but think of that side material that sidebar as an

21213 :  so there are one thousand two hundred of people at this tedx event

21214 :  but the point is that thousands of people have watched this video because ellens dad happens to be a

21215 :  and im going to tell you three stories about how that tool is being used in the world

21216 :  i think that the next teacher or student that participates in ted ed will be too

21217 :  i dont know the answer to that but my staff is really excited to work towards

21218 :  first i would have changed the title so that it related to my class

21219 :  one day when i was a special education high school teacher i was teaching a study skills class

21220 :  so at minus two hundred and seventyone degrees colder than the space between the stars those wires can take that current

21221 :  i asked myself why i had ignored what was going on in my head for so long simply to maintain this

21222 :  the bridge team consists of an academic coordinator who has the weirdest taste in music like this guy is either listening to bob

21223 :  sadness is an emotion that comes and goes just as happiness does

21224 :  is it just a coincidence that school systems and standardized tests are getting harder and college acceptance rates are going

21225 :  its time to fight back

21226 :  oftentimes conversations regarding mental illnesses such as depression result in words being thrown around that

21227 :  though i could go on im not here to simply tell you all about my story

21228 :  its the gravitational pull that makes these things orbit

21229 :  and then its a black hole

21230 :  it depends only on the mass of the object

21231 :  so what i want to tell you very briefly is a few examples of the excitement of what we can do today at the

21232 :  because i want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible

21233 :  gravity wins over all other known forces

21234 :  so in that sense its a very simple object

21235 :  so what people have thought is that perhaps there are supermassive black holes which

21236 :  bigger objects have bigger schwarzschild radii

21237 :  and in fact its the best evidence we have to date for not only existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy but

21238 :  and if i know the scale of the orbit i know the radius

21239 :  at that point gravity wins

21240 :  and that buys us about a factor of twenty
21241 :  so you shouldnt see young stars

21242 :  and im going to only talk about the mass

21243 :  and in fact today this is what were trying to figure out this mystery of how do you get how do you resolve this contradiction

21244 :  so if i know how fast it goes around i know the mass

21245 :  we all have a voice and a place in the fragmented systems around us

21246 :  now notice the word here is become

21247 :  now i know of course we have to make a living but nobody in this room thinks that thats the answer to the question

21248 :  so we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature

21249 :  and in the social sciences the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding

21250 :  just what kind of human nature do you want to help design

21251 :  that was the only reason anyone ever did anything

21252 :  im not talking about the technology of things profound though that is

21253 :  well when im not fighting the coded gaze as a poet of code im a graduate student at the

21254 :  i wanted to show people the way data relates to their everyday lives

21255 :  but you wouldnt necessarily know that to look at the media

21256 :  we dont use decimal places to describe the temperature

21257 :  theyre civil servants

21258 :  find out how they collected the numbers

21259 :  people are really reluctant to answer their phones to pollsters and also shockingly enough people might lie

21260 :  so i became a data journalist

21261 :  as soon as its buried in a chart it feels like some kind of objective science and its not

21262 :  when you hear a statistic you might feel skeptical

21263 :  ill use one last example here

21264 :  do people regret their tattoos

21265 :  but you should also be able to tell which numbers are reliable and which ones arent

21266 :  how can we have public debate about immigration if we cant at least agree on how many people are entering and leaving the country

21267 :  questions like is it normal to sleep in a separate bed to my wife

21268 :  much to my dismay this wasnt an isolated incident

21269 :  anger can motivate you

21270 :  anger destroys apathy

21271 :  i didnt fight any harder than jace for some arbitrary reason my body responded better to chemotherapy than he did

21272 :  yeah but its gotten to the point where the risk associated with not helping anyone is so much monumentally

21273 :  the cancer ended up returning in my lungs

21274 :  theyve gone to the edge of what they could endure and theyve returned victoriously so that must mean that theyre finished

21275 :  sometimes life puts you in these serendipitous situations that cant really be explained

21276 :  unhappiness depression unemployment

21277 :  end quote the chinese government

21278 :  so is this some massive failure of primary school policy

21279 :  now ive been speaking french for twentyfive years ive lived in france and my family is bilingual english french and

21280 :  with childrens hands its really really hard to play

21281 :  you learn about rhythm and time signatures keeping time with others and harmonies

21282 :  its happening as we speak with lessons delivered by esperanto specialists like me but also

21283 :  and so the kids quickly get past the stage where they just have to remember stuff and can get onto actually using

21284 :  a few people carry it on but the vast majority of us dont

21285 :  im no good at music

21286 :  we start to read music

21287 :  by learning the recorder we learn about music

21288 :  it helps to develop all the mental gymnastics thats involved in having two

21289 :  actually its obvious

21290 :  thats not the point

21291 :  so by translating the number into esperanto it clarifies whats going on what that 2 in 27 actually means

21292 :  why is it so good at this

21293 :  and then its dudek unu dudek du and so on all the way up to ninetynine
21294 :  of course thats not the point

21295 :  we squeaked by

21296 :  im going to call him kush

21297 :  kush translated into gujarati something ravi had never seen

21298 :  after about a year in law school i almost dropped out

21299 :  and the world seems to have decided thats ok

21300 :  i spent just two days in his place and i coughed for a week

21301 :  its called the consent to operate

21302 :  ive got you

21303 :  its important in its own right and its crucial for just about everything else we care about

21304 :  im going to call him ravi nanda

21305 :  number two push your politicians and your governments to make this a public

21306 :  we can inspire each other

21307 :  weve seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter

21308 :  im going to demo this sound for you right now

21309 :  that sound pattern actually primes your mind to have more of these regenerative delta waves

21310 :  dmitry gerashchenko from harvard medical school

21311 :  and we have done with it what the semiconductor industry has done so successfully for the past fifty years

21312 :  we shrunk the dimensions of this technology from the micron scale to the true nanoscale

21313 :  with the work that my team has already done on separation of nanoscale biomarkers for rapid early stage

21314 :  and because theyre abundantly present in just about every bodily fluid including blood urine and saliva

21315 :  so how does it work

21316 :  once thought to be little bins for unwanted cellular waste it has been found that cells actually

21317 :  were working on ways to frequently activate an early stage cancer alarm by enabling

21318 :  its called the sunga

21319 :  so i thought i would share with you

21320 :  i am here for a reason and i suspect that a lot of you might be here for the same reason

21321 :  what would i learn from somebody whos brilliant in one way

21322 :  the number of diseases that are treatable by exercise is

21323 :  this was never anticipated

21324 :  as physical and mental activity was enormous

21325 :  obesity can cause diabetes heart disease and cancer

21326 :  seeing an attractive young lady

21327 :  the increase of height of 10cm during the last few hundred years seems to have

21328 :  we can now compare the monkey that had a mother and not

21329 :  my colleague stephen suomi has been rearing monkeys in two different ways

21330 :  these monkeys already didnt see their mother so they had a social experience

21331 :  or is it going to be an easy world and you have to be different

21332 :  so maybe that s how astrology got started i don t know

21333 :  i m a greeting card publisher

21334 :  but so i spent a week trying to get my brain around

21335 :  the question comes up

21336 :  they need to start sharing precompetitive research

21337 :  its not bad

21338 :  sunlight is the best disinfectant

21339 :  the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge

21340 :  the internet gives us access not just to information and knowledge but to the intelligence contained in the

21341 :  but you also need to have values

21342 :  your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night

21343 :  the pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets in a commons

21344 :  there was no concept of progress

21345 :  but that doesnt matter because this is moving forward

21346 :  but in the tunisian revolution the new media didnt cause the revolution it was caused by

21347 :  the pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble

21348 :  the market value of his company goes from ninety million to ten billion dollars and i can tell you because

21349 :  it was a tool of self defense

21350 :  the metro in brussels not in paris were shut down for five full days

21351 :  ive been in prison only once in my life before

21352 :  the mayor bourgmestre was asked what he thought about it

21353 :  lets do something

21354 :  that solves the problem of unemployment

21355 :  suppose we have such an unconditional basic income

21356 :  problem number one unemployment

21357 :  basic income is not the whole of it but it is an essential

21358 :  what about the other problem this radical alternative to capitalism as we know it

21359 :  now you know more or less what it is

21360 :  how can we go to a greater battle

21361 :  what can creatures like us know of such things

21362 :  he took some money well take his money

21363 :  i have done wrong

21364 :  and it was about this point in my life that my obsession with time morphed

21365 :  somehow our brains are contracting

21366 :  theyre actually causing time to go faster

21367 :  and they have an incredible depth of experience

21368 :  maybe you take a half day at work

21369 :  same goes for your brain

21370 :  lets try to slow down time try to expand time try to create time

21371 :  let me show you why

21372 :  why is this

21373 :  no theres no such thing as chronological time

21374 :  time flows through your and my brain just like water through a garden hose

21375 :  he said goodbye to them while he shared with them the meaning that they had had in his life

21376 :  and summers last forever

21377 :  we really lived everything we did

21378 :  trade awesome day for a boring week

21379 :  how do you maximize the second law of experiential time

21380 :  e mc2 everybody is familiar with this formula the law of relativity

21381 :  theres a range but approximately around the same place

21382 :  i dont know what it is to lose the protection of my country

21383 :  they have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness

21384 :  those crimes should not go unpunished

21385 :  he would scream

21386 :  ive lost that count

21387 :  i cannot forget them

21388 :  my parents were totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and

21389 :  its a mile high and i grew up there with my ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents

21390 :  i knew another young man though who had ph who died while waiting for one

21391 :  i went to see this specialist and she was top of the field and told me i had to stop

21392 :  we fight very hard to avoid it but we cannot somehow avoid the perception of

21393 :  that is how it works

21394 :  they go out and they find facts and they assemble those facts and they provide context for the

21395 :  information reported after a rigorous series of checks and balances to ensure accuracy and

21396 :  is it something our audience wants

21397 :  i grew up in a home where news was important

21398 :  we dont win

21399 :  thats the zero sum

21400 :  and women are much more comfortable and therefore much more persuasive when theyre negotiating in a positive sum

21401 :  that is most certainly the message

21402 :  and i truly believe its a problem that solves itself

21403 :  but with regard to negotiating profitable deals i think that there is a substantive difference

21404 :  high executives functioning skills

21405 :  we were going to do all the things that we needed to do and we were bringing in a great business and a great employer and a great

21406 :  and i can tell you that ten years ago i proposed tearing down a fifty year old completely

21407 :  i mean this was their homes behind us that have in ground swimming pools

21408 :  but it was an amazing lesson about how to persuade how to be persuasive in a

21409 :  where women were found lacking in what i wanted to talk about today were in two areas

21410 :  you can fight city hall and win

21411 :  i mean this is a fancy part of toledo

21412 :  im going to focus on the business results because thats an area that im more familiar with

21413 :  and we need to survey your heirloom tomatoes if were going to take down this fence

21414 :  we werent kind of out in the sticks

21415 :  but that is not what leadership is

21416 :  told me i couldnt do it but i did

21417 :  what would that mean

21418 :  we would want to be sure in a perfect world that the chicks would be able to hatch walk around and feed themselves

21419 :  what if there were a possibility of bringing birds back from extinction

21420 :  many islands have lost those components

21421 :  we take all of the data from all those sensors and create the programs that allow the cars to drive themselves

21422 :  we really took a look at where we want to be in two thousand and fifty and we highlighted areas that we

21423 :  every company has their own philosophy

21424 :  and this is really where smart mobility plays a huge role

21425 :  you can hardly get around

21426 :  this is really just the beginning now we need to apply the human intelligence make the

21427 :  and thirdly how can we improve peoples lives especially those of the elderly and the disabled

21428 :  do you automatically become defensive when you hear discussions around male privilege

21429 :  two or three times a year i attend national conferences related to this topic and the gender split at these

21430 :  we do it by making it relatable

21431 :  but the question should not be

21432 :  the question should be

21433 :  this comes more easily and more quickly for some clients than it does for others

21434 :  regardless of where i worked or what my clients looked like so many of them were living with instances or

21435 :  lets start with day to day things

21436 :  how do we engage more man in the prevention of violence against women

21437 :  if the victim is cared for and supported they are less likely to show symptoms of ptsd and

21438 :  so as i posed these questions im posing them for everyone

21439 :  therapists are trained to listen to their clients

21440 :  a sibling a friend a roommate

21441 :  when it comes up how do you talk about rape

21442 :  it was about halfway through this process that i started to notice a common theme among many of my clients

21443 :  and if so how do you do it

21444 :  so this is a call to action for men to join the ranks

21445 :  to strengthen our team of allies

21446 :  theres a groundbreaking research on this that comes from dr rebecca campbell

21447 :  well thats why i take every performance so seriously why it matters to me so much

21448 :  now this moment so fascinates me

21449 :  i find it such a profound one

21450 :  and in fact as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature harmony grew

21451 :  and for him it wasnt so much the way the music goes as about what it

21452 :  its the why part of it

21453 :  what happens when the music stops

21454 :  mozart was the same way

21455 :  it spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like caruso and bessie smith were on the same

21456 :  so many emotions seem to be inside of it

21457 :  the question remains what happens when the music stops

21458 :  and red snapper we tested one hundred and twenty samples and only seven of them were really red snapper so good luck finding a red

21459 :  its being done by some in the industry but not enough so were pushing a law in congress called the safe seafood act and im very

21460 :  fifty nine percent of the tuna we tested was mislabeled

21461 :  if we do a few simple things in targeted places we can bring our fisheries back and use them to

21462 :  we know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably

21463 :  do we have to fix fisheries management in all of those countries

21464 :  this doesnt have to be peak fish

21465 :  so i soldiered on

21466 :  i went on to study psychology to try to understand what was wrong with me what was the

21467 :  geometry was a nightmare

21468 :  and by the time i was finished i was surrounded by a pile of a hundred books and i had been able to read

21469 :  so i pulled another book off the shelf opened it read it and understood it

21470 :  i could not judge how far away was that car

21471 :  i would bang and bump into things on the left side of my body

21472 :  and the challenging pieces

21473 :  we worry too much about the salacious news headlines and not enough about what

21474 :  you can set it on a three minute setting or if you fond of five more minutes in your children you can get five more minutes

21475 :  because their text will be very boring

21476 :  theyre sleeping theyre doing their homework theyre eating dinner with their parents

21477 :  and its really helpful for the kids

21478 :  and now many of us depend on the telephone to support family life

21479 :  so this suggests again that they really do need adult mentorship

21480 :  whats that really like

21481 :  what its like to watch a slumber party that you werent invited to unfold

21482 :  the most likely thing is that theyre doing something else

21483 :  because people were concerned about the train moving more than thirty miles an hour

21484 :  so they designed an app

21485 :  because in order to raise kids with empathy we need to understand more about their day to day lives

21486 :  empathy is the app

21487 :  i heard a bad news story

21488 :  but theyre turning the timer back on us

21489 :  they feel like theyre not needed

21490 :  more than they need us to spy on them they need us to help them figure out what do we do when things go wrong in a

21491 :  we probably all need a little app that gives a little thought bubble

21492 :  every single kid that i have met this age who ive talked to about what problems in your life does

21493 :  so what it does is you train the app to recognize the voice of your children so that random kids cant

21494 :  and so we need to really get curious what could this person be doing

21495 :  are you sure you want to send that

21496 :  we hurt their feelings in some way

21497 :  we dont have to be plugged in all the time

21498 :  its time to retune refocus and remember who closed captioning was created

21499 :  if you dont think that makes it hard for a deaf person to follow a program try watching a tv

21500 :  sixty years before we had descriptive video service for blind people

21501 :  but the only way to assure high quality realtime closed captioning is to hire and train

21502 :  television broadcasts in the united states began in one thousand nine hundred and twentyeight
21503 :  and those insights can be yours

21504 :  in food chains the loveliest species are the single celled plants and their tiny predators

21505 :  bosses are how do we motivate them

21506 :  and understanding that makes working together easier and it makes being a father easier

21507 :  theyre dirt poor

21508 :  the boss is going youre my best millennial

21509 :  they say twentyeight twentyseven
21510 :  his mother said no you have five hundred dollars to your name and a new bride

21511 :  we could put it on the credit card and youll let us move back in with you wont you

21512 :  he said my new bride can work

21513 :  you graduate with an apprenticeship and are able to read a blueprint and youre a welder you start at

21514 :  if its a life stage its a change that we need to understand and adapt to

21515 :  change places they live

21516 :  my wife and i were apart from each other when we were engaged for six months

21517 :  he was going to get a business job last year

21518 :  parents say this when i was twentyfive i had a mortgage and a kid

21519 :  im going to go make this work

21520 :  you graduate with a business degree you make fortyfive thousand dollars as a salesman

21521 :  we didnt facetime we wrote each other letters for six months while we were engaged

21522 :  we all see it we just didnt have a name for it

21523 :  all start ups are risky but this was twice as risky as the average start up

21524 :  simple the research is absolutely clear

21525 :  dude come back

21526 :  i dont know why theyre not engaged

21527 :  because theyre not twentyeight with a mortgage and a baby

21528 :  i think laborers are amazingly valuable and honorable work

21529 :  change people they date

21530 :  i found somebody in seattle on match

21531 :  its your first job

21532 :  theyre facetiming i think this is my soul mate

21533 :  this one my friends is a game changer because if its the millennials theyre are a problem that needs to be

21534 :  so they live out there

21535 :  because a plane flight was two hundred dollars and long distance was two dollars a minute

21536 :  she can get into any grad school with her grades

21537 :  i think this is going to work

21538 :  they have hand me down furniture in the back of a u haul and he just resigned last wednesday

21539 :  mike rowe and the whole campaign to give honor to people who are laborers in dirty jobs

21540 :  half of what youve heard about millennials is wrong

21541 :  were fine and we both want to live in rhode island

21542 :  when he graduates his mother says go do this residency

21543 :  so they moved to rhode island which has great lobster rolls i have to tell you after living in chicago

21544 :  theyre quite happy

21545 :  how do we keep them from leaving

21546 :  its very selective

21547 :  max youre not going to be there forever

21548 :  he ran out of money

21549 :  half of the frustrations millennials have about communicating with the older generations about what they

21550 :  and understand their point of view

21551 :  find out as much information as possible about the person you are interested in understanding

21552 :  and this is the most important point

21553 :  do the google search

21554 :  i mean we have to start translating

21555 :  so i would say there is more to interpreting than meets the eye

21556 :  and actually there is an important precedent for such a pause from the 1970s when scientists

21557 :  its interesting that as i talk to people my scientific colleagues as well as others theres a wide variety of

21558 :  we also want to understand better how to control the way that dna is repaired after its cut

21559 :  we can think of older genome engineering technologies as similar to

21560 :  but i do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a

21561 :  part of the crispr system is a protein called cas9 thats able to seek out

21562 :  and ive just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long

21563 :  the icecaps were much bigger

21564 :  it was collected from close to antarctica thousands of meters below the sea so very different than the

21565 :  the way i look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals

21566 :  so were pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this

21567 :  they covered lots of the continent and they extended out over the ocean

21568 :  but four thousand years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum

21569 :  you can see an image of one of these corals behind me

21570 :  i look at the chemistry of the ocean today

21571 :  i look at the chemistry of the ocean in the past

21572 :  so we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products thorium in these corals and that tells us

21573 :  in my lowest moments of insecurity this is when i realized that i had to reclaim my

21574 :  the feminine beauty

21575 :  as a curvy woman it was the assumption that i should look up to marilyn monroe or jennifer lopez

21576 :  i would see that persons eyebrow raise as i would reply

21577 :  well im a plus size model

21578 :  i was twelve years old and scouted in a mall

21579 :  i hope youll take it with me

21580 :  i invite you to take that risk with me

21581 :  we can strip that tissue very economically and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to

21582 :  we really want that information

21583 :  we didnt know

21584 :  that was my moment of seeing what was really going on

21585 :  and they were in the streets you can see it in the slides behind me saying

21586 :  because they need them to survive

21587 :  are there more dangerous viruses coming out

21588 :  what are you doing in these laboratories

21589 :  dont they know where these big problems are

21590 :  whos getting the nobel prize

21591 :  how do you decide who gets the money

21592 :  this is the way to survive in science

21593 :  science has grown

21594 :  were spending too little time on quality control

21595 :  you guys have to act up you have to fight the disease not each other

21596 :  and of course we should reward academics investigators for picking up the

21597 :  were all very hasty we have little time we have to publish

21598 :  what should we do

21599 :  the guys form act up really went to the national institute of health and walked into our laboratories to

21600 :  and then of course theres a problem

21601 :  and theres no reason why there cant be a retiree internship program

21602 :  i tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working

21603 :  thats not the employers job

21604 :  now my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more

21605 :  i found powerpoint much more challenging but now i use powerpoint all the time

21606 :  the first thing i told tracy was she had to get out of the house

21607 :  think about how far we have come

21608 :  employers can view hiring people with a gap on their r sum as a high risk proposition

21609 :  shes even hired another relauncher for work for her

21610 :  theyve paid for her to get her mba at night

21611 :  a lot of the commands are the same

21612 :  different pool same concept

21613 :  she was looking for a finance or accounting role and she had just spent the last nine months

21614 :  so let me tell you what happened with tracy shapiro

21615 :  and another one popped up

21616 :  whats kind of interesting about that is when the brain is inhibited it also inhibits

21617 :  it can be any type of challenge

21618 :  you think why are we designed that way

21619 :  a rabbit in the headlights

21620 :  no thats wrong

21621 :  in the center of the chest

21622 :  you go deaf

21623 :  you were rubbish

21624 :  what is the biological context from which thought emerges

21625 :  no one person can design very complex objects all by

21626 :  so i fell in love with the night sky

21627 :  think about it

21628 :  i won a scholarship to work at an observatory and study with a professional astronomer

21629 :  i decided early on that my intellect was my ticket out and i worked hard in and out of

21630 :  and he said im sorry i cant tell you

21631 :  we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets

21632 :  and i asked one of the voters i said whom are you going to vote for

21633 :  now in one thousand nine hundred and fiftyseven ghana was the first sub saharan country to gain its independence

21634 :  i mean at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy they did not abuse their power

21635 :  and they had traveled from near they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard

21636 :  i wanted to document on film the two thousand and eight presidential elections

21637 :  whats most interesting is that the same level of oxygen that damaged the cancer cells was

21638 :  there are many therapeutic applications of ketones because nearly all healthy cells in a body

21639 :  it was like manna from heaven

21640 :  well its extraordinary

21641 :  and the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb

21642 :  thirdly when norden was making his calculations he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively

21643 :  and this is the problem with our infatuation with the things we make

21644 :  so they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds

21645 :  its a complicated physics problem

21646 :  its a real pleasure to be here

21647 :  i talked about spaghetti sauce

21648 :  but he said with the mark fifteen norden bombsight he could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at

21649 :  secondly it breaks down a lot

21650 :  well it allowed you to do that

21651 :  and i mean that in its fullest sense of the word

21652 :  thats always been the harder problem when it comes to fighting wars

21653 :  and what was gods will

21654 :  theyve invented websites that will allow people to be free

21655 :  and the mans name is carl norden

21656 :  we think were now at ninetyfive percent accuracy when it comes to drone strikes

21657 :  is it because their weapons werent accurate

21658 :  the mission of the two squadrons was to get rid of all the scud missile launchers

21659 :  now what is the accuracy of those drones

21660 :  and what did the norden bombsight do

21661 :  that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare

21662 :  and that is on august six one thousand nine hundred and fortyfive a b twentynine bomber

21663 :  and when these united nations bodies talk to the french republic and issue their very

21664 :  at our human right center at gent university we did legal research on that checking the proposed ban

21665 :  the building there

21666 :  well ok now i want to become an architect

21667 :  whats most important right now is to pay attention

21668 :  i see that habit

21669 :  blind leading the blind

21670 :  i would see men

21671 :  they looked like my dad

21672 :  how can we do the most good and the least harm to people animals and the environment through all of our

21673 :  note the ways in which youre like

21674 :  thats a question that i think we all ought to ask ourselves

21675 :  i loved that sheep

21676 :  unless somebody tells us we would never know

21677 :  back then i also happened to be a big fan of the television series star trek

21678 :  and it would be illegal to take any of those birds and put them into a cage so small that they could never stretch a wing

21679 :  as i got closer i was comforted by her warm smile

21680 :  who is that person

21681 :  wasteful abusive and focused on labor productivity

21682 :  this has paid all the costs for the transformation of interface

21683 :  powered by fossil fuel derived energy

21684 :  and maybe that will lead us to that sustainable future that we all dream about

21685 :  thats a very complex thing to deal with in a hospital ward

21686 :  and people would stop and sit beside rose

21687 :  so thats exactly what he did

21688 :  thats the importance of the what matters to you conversation

21689 :  well the end of the story is that don entered scotlands five inch

21690 :  this is paiges what matters to you

21691 :  you might have a sixteen a twenty a twentyfour you might have a twelve
21692 :  i was raised in a story where caution was useless lb amp tl

21693 :  every two minutes an american is sexually assaulted

21694 :  primary schools are free in malawi

21695 :  so as a result of that demographers predict that through two thousand and twentyfive
21696 :  the road was too rough

21697 :  it meets our needs

21698 :  and then finally to get this out to the people in scale we teamed up with the largest disability organization in the world

21699 :  so being a mechanical engineer being at mit and having lots of resources available to me i thought id try to do something

21700 :  languages are often perceived to be the great unknown

21701 :  its actually the only way we can get things right

21702 :  as children were even expected to make them

21703 :  i cant promise you this

21704 :  so i wanted to put forward three simple things that might help as you take your own journey outside of your

21705 :  honestly it feels counter to most of the instincts that you have

21706 :  if you go to ted

21707 :  but dont fret there are resources for all these things

21708 :  instead i am looking forward to at least somehow the year of the insurance

21709 :  but i can do a lot of different things

21710 :  if thats my concern heres my hope

21711 :  that was how the world had treated her and that was how she had come to feel

21712 :  you might literally have said that

21713 :  that is self love

21714 :  so how do we change ourselves

21715 :  the people around us miss out on so much as well

21716 :  she talked about fondness for those things

21717 :  and crime led to prison and prison led to the chair in the corner of my office

21718 :  think of the big things and think of the small ones

21719 :  its that self esteem that enables us to be ourselves to confidently be

21720 :  they miss out on that unique gift that only we can bring to them

21721 :  and were able to say thats good

21722 :  then she found self love

21723 :  its not being self absorbed

21724 :  this is my concern

21725 :  its just saying there are things i do that go well

21726 :  its not being egocentric

21727 :  its just being realistic

21728 :  it is not perfect but it is good

21729 :  and she talked and talked maybe i would just use on wednesdays

21730 :  as i said about a year ago i started realizing that i needed to make a change

21731 :  well call this the seven minute principle

21732 :  ive seen you

21733 :  thats the way it works

21734 :  we all became the people we are thanks to positive strength thanks to someone who told

21735 :  we all have that

21736 :  they turned an old vegetable box upside down im standing on it reciting a poem and i hopefully get an ice cream

21737 :  and then i got an ice cream

21738 :  ive seen you

21739 :  namaste means three things

21740 :  im not driving the country in a car full of balloons

21741 :  life is not a party

21742 :  i got lots of ice cream in my youth

21743 :  we all are ambassadors of some strength

21744 :  there is a positive strength in you

21745 :  we know that the relationship between optimism and happiness is quite

21746 :  i would be standing on it and recite poems

21747 :  and when youre happier youre healthier and successful in sports in science in friendship

21748 :  when you smoke you get lung cancer

21749 :  when you are an optimist you become happy

21750 :  i bow deeply for that

21751 :  as something fragile broken and special or as people who have

21752 :  you might see your own perspective reflected in one of these models or you might be thinking that youve never even thought about

21753 :  i was walking in the mall one november day and i saw this poster for a special photo session with santa

21754 :  we design special services for special kids

21755 :  in fact it informed the whole rest of my career

21756 :  i mean that seems like a nice thing to do right

21757 :  i know these events are happening in malls all around the country and i bet most people feel pretty good about them

21758 :  we feel sorry for people who are broken and need fixing and we feel charitable when we

21759 :  i had been so caught up in the visuals and my own good feelings about this that i had completely

21760 :  at the end of the day were happy we never listen to anyone who said that batik and technology should

21761 :  we were telling him that were able to create batik patterns using

21762 :  and as i say im not a neuroscientist but to understand how i can start to assemble things that will very

21763 :  its something much bigger

21764 :  theres something weird happening

21765 :  and this is possible for you

21766 :  but to the body stress is very different

21767 :  my husband cut two fingers off his left hand with a table saw

21768 :  we all know it

21769 :  because i have a dream of a healed healthcare system one in which we bring the best of

21770 :  jones who spent eight hours in surgery with a microscope putting those fingers back on so that my husband has ten fingers today

21771 :  yeah so thank god for dr

21772 :  this soul medicine i think is so much of what weve lost in modern medicine today

21773 :  so weve made this collective agreement

21774 :  videos created with popcorn behave like the web itself dynamic full of links and

21775 :  it also means theres no proprietary software

21776 :  so lets watch it

21777 :  well go back and ill show you how we made it

21778 :  it will be completely free and it will work in any browser

21779 :  each day people make new decisions and people change and the world changes around them and each day all of

21780 :  you really reduce congestion quite substantially

21781 :  but well as i said i mean car drivers adapt right

21782 :  someone must control all of this

21783 :  its because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think

21784 :  and why is that

21785 :  no one is in charge

21786 :  i mean its a very complicated system

21787 :  if women were more likely to have orgasms with some men than others then this could be a mechanism by which they

21788 :  so male provisioning both possible through hunting and necessary

21789 :  but think about what impact this would have

21790 :  so how did we get there

21791 :  so thats a big change

21792 :  and womens mate preferences similarly change over the cycle so that they prefer more dominant more masculine males

21793 :  so thats one point that i want to make

21794 :  the average man is stronger than ninetynine
21795 :  org website and all the spots we had already done

21796 :  and if we team together we are a power that can incite change

21797 :  because once they were on board they called their friends who called their friends who called their friends

21798 :  then the whole third grade found out and it made me feel down on myself and not want

21799 :  just by saying something like youre fat or nobody likes you can cause people to thinking down on themselves

21800 :  have you ever heard the saying dont judge a book by its cover

21801 :  well thats always true

21802 :  we judge people because of jealousy when we se someone we automatically jump to conclusions about them

21803 :  they are throwing it up in the air

21804 :  two thousand and eleven the hundred most popular movies

21805 :  but there is a number that is greater than this thats going to bring this room

21806 :  there are no models for them

21807 :  i searched how do i overcome the fear of rejection

21808 :  i didnt do any of that

21809 :  these people did not let rejection define them

21810 :  i said hi to every customer that walked in and gave them holiday cheers

21811 :  i use my blog i use my talk i use the book i just published and im even building

21812 :  he was like no one has done this before

21813 :  ok i can build a better company

21814 :  thats one version

21815 :  and in that picture which you cant see i quoted martin luther king jr

21816 :  why dont you come back in two months

21817 :  i saw dead people

21818 :  if you want to do this go across the street and talk to connie

21819 :  i just couldnt believe it

21820 :  its as if hes putting all the doubt on the floor

21821 :  i dont want to waste your flower

21822 :  what i really wanted to do was learn and to change myself

21823 :  but before he could leave i said hey can i know why

21824 :  i went across and knocked on connies door

21825 :  he said wow i can use this

21826 :  so for the next hour i was the starbucks greeter

21827 :  and then i learned i could fulfill my life dream

21828 :  but we also know that most of us cant do it and the ones that can afford to do it its complicated

21829 :  once you get in youre hooked

21830 :  none of this belongs to google

21831 :  and the way i did it was i realized one day that she loves gold

21832 :  what we now have are the building blocks to a very exciting future when it comes to arts and culture

21833 :  and we need to be able to touch people

21834 :  so this goes back to my first question

21835 :  illustrations can be touching

21836 :  i think thats a challenge for both the humanitarian actors and people from the media people like me

21837 :  and that is a fertile ground for alt facts to grow

21838 :  my timeline was pretty liberal

21839 :  talking bad about al sharpton and black lives matter

21840 :  thats a dangerous imbalance

21841 :  into controversial talking points

21842 :  where are these guys getting their arguments from

21843 :  i admit this race stuff can be kind of divisive

21844 :  but it is the way that i articulated race that made me somewhat of a digital lightening rod

21845 :  a lot of these guys were just regular joes

21846 :  the water is great

21847 :  join the party

21848 :  although the supposed morons engaged in what appeared to be original thought

21849 :  and so was i

21850 :  it is time we start seeing people as people and not simply the ideas we project onto them or react

21851 :  so i soon became familiar with the phenomenon of an internet troll

21852 :  and we did this

21853 :  then with my cell phone i flipped the internet against itself and began to broadcast

21854 :  this made them want to leave the safety of their laptops and meet us in person to have real conversations with real

21855 :  mind you not enough compassion like i want to be friends

21856 :  at the same time

21857 :  and what is worse many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on

21858 :  for example sending money from benin to nigeria

21859 :  it all goes in suitcases

21860 :  to send money within africa the cost is even higher over twenty percent

21861 :  without there being very serious consequences

21862 :  when people meditate it activates the front part of their brain which is the most human

21863 :  diet is absolutely essential

21864 :  become very serious about who you spend your time with

21865 :  you write down three things youre grateful for every day

21866 :  because youre making better decisions

21867 :  thats the cool thing about the brain

21868 :  new learning so ted is perfect for this

21869 :  and as sleep goes down weight goes up because your cravings get out of control

21870 :  it is dependent on the physical health of your brain

21871 :  if we all felt strongly about the same things wed all be solving the same problems and ignoring the same problems

21872 :  so i decided to make mpi the worlds first open source philosophy

21873 :  im trying to tell you to tell humanity what you think

21874 :  let me ask a question

21875 :  what was the point of it all

21876 :  well my thinking was well self discovery seems to be infinite

21877 :  pursuing your passion that takes courage

21878 :  now lets really nail down passion because the idea of not even bothering to search for it is still ringing in my head

21879 :  what should i do next

21880 :  if humanity held a team meeting i would say ok

21881 :  and i could relate and i felt strongly about it

21882 :  where did that music come from

21883 :  how is that possible

21884 :  and its a kind of rope like structure that twirls and swirls like this

21885 :  and my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for nasa to do virtual surgery in preparation for

21886 :  not only in disease management but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that

21887 :  i got the data

21888 :  because we kept on seeing this in different parts of the body

21889 :  i remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen

21890 :  one of the opportunities i had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance

21891 :  so perfectly organized a structure it was hard not to attribute divinity to it

21892 :  and tells each other theyre great

21893 :  having said that how do you have a good relationship or even just a better relationship if you

21894 :  my transition starts in two thousand and eight when i started blogging about plus

21895 :  being fat to me now its just a word its just one of the many descriptors

21896 :  wed ask them to partner with schools and non profits in africa

21897 :  how can we help

21898 :  but its not enough for the world that we want to create

21899 :  we got a pretty amazing answer

21900 :  i didnt know what would happen from my involvement

21901 :  i didnt know much about olpc before my friends got involved

21902 :  but its so important to take that step

21903 :  how can i help

21904 :  my story begins about three years ago in the summer of two thousand and eight
21905 :  olpc asked me and my friend paul to run a new program for them called olpc corps

21906 :  when i first got involved it was a small step

21907 :  but i took the plunge

21908 :  but i was still interested

21909 :  i wanted to get involved to produce

21910 :  wed fund them train them send them laptops

21911 :  because without it i wouldnt have known about this passion i have for the project

21912 :  i was worried that i would be stepping on someones toes if i got involved

21913 :  you have time

21914 :  it demands action

21915 :  but i tried something when i got involved with olpc

21916 :  sharing ideas is wonderful and incredibly important

21917 :  olpc believes these things too

21918 :  you have talent

21919 :  what if i live to be a one hundred
21920 :  so it was testing again

21921 :  its called full spectrum

21922 :  cant make it

21923 :  at the outset i found the idea of homeless people kind of like the individuals i met in the

21924 :  im far from a hero

21925 :  right as you walk in the door you can tell someone smells bad

21926 :  but the career choice stuck

21927 :  i am male i identify entirely as male and ive always been male

21928 :  so how can we spread awareness

21929 :  but they got it wrong

21930 :  it is a whole entire spectrum

21931 :  as ive told you i identify as male

21932 :  please explain to me

21933 :  how can we make it more possible for people to understand and accept people like me into their

21934 :  what can change peoples outlook on us

21935 :  how is it possible for this person to go from being samantha kate hobman to being charles francis

21936 :  gender identity is what you identify as

21937 :  that uncertainty kept me within my shell and it kept me hiding away from who i am

21938 :  thats how i was expressing myself

21939 :  self discovery is such an important thing that i dont understand why its not enforced more into

21940 :  now that would be useful if youre working in maritime industry and youre trying to protect your

21941 :  with this stuff i can make it dissolve in about a week

21942 :  it buffers the water

21943 :  but we had to come back

21944 :  so were already able to manufacture

21945 :  and then it would dissolve

21946 :  i believe in womens rights equality and freedom

21947 :  now before i leave you today id like to tell you a story about a moment in my life

21948 :  i mean not only did my peers question my legitimacy but airport security

21949 :  islam also further increases a womans autonomy by giving her marital rights

21950 :  and historical records also show that prophet muhammad would consult women on decisions

21951 :  they must wear all white after their husbands die for the rest of their lives

21952 :  for example when jennifer kahn wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called crispr she

21953 :  if you can reveal a disconnection in someones worldview theyll feel the need to bridge that

21954 :  well you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and

21955 :  its why we all have different r sum s

21956 :  children are natural learners

21957 :  its like people are sailing into a headwind all the time

21958 :  they recognize that you cant improve education if you dont pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant

21959 :  im not here to argue against science and math

21960 :  ive traveled the whole length and breadth of this country

21961 :  and the third principle is this that human life is inherently creative

21962 :  it shouldnt obstruct it which of course it often does

21963 :  thats one of the problems of the test

21964 :  no im fine

21965 :  economy over ten years of nearly a trillion dollars

21966 :  its the common currency of being a human being

21967 :  nothing grows there because it doesnt rain

21968 :  you see in the end education is about learning

21969 :  culture is an organic term isnt it

21970 :  its why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic

21971 :  we then play them a piece of sad music and their depression levels really

21972 :  when it comes to music we actually seem to enjoy feeling sad

21973 :  so for people with tendencies to depression often negative emotions are more easily triggered in them

21974 :  well that was the question that i set out to find the answer to and along with my colleagues weve

21975 :  with a the good thing about music is it can help you to really feel your emotions to really

21976 :  but if you already at this clinical levels of major depression and then you mood goes even lower

21977 :  and weve also done experiments where weve actually played sad music to people and then measure the effects on

21978 :  why is it that we seem to enjoy feeling sad when we are listening to music

21979 :  the best solution is to build natural seaside sanctuaries where captive whales and dolphins can

21980 :  keiko always loved to chase birds across his bay

21981 :  but the whales will still be in concrete tanks

21982 :  but broadband penetration was too low in one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine two thousand
21983 :  we started a company called z

21984 :  com it was an online entertainment company

21985 :  your grandfather built it as the first house in north alnuzha

21986 :  it matters because as a result of that particular moment in one thousand nine hundred and fortyeight hundreds of thousands of

21987 :  so in it he writes hi tamara how are you

21988 :  and we were among the fortunate few to be able to board a plane onto safer ground

21989 :  lucky for us the theory stacks up

21990 :  one of the big myths of civilization is that people were hunter gathers one day discovered agriculture and we never looked

21991 :  in a forest garden we are trying to use our layers and these connections to create associations between the

21992 :  the reality is there is a third way which was practiced by people around the world and more resembles

21993 :  through the application of forest garden principles and a little bit of thoughtful design a population of pollinators could be

21994 :  it is time for canberra to move beyond its initial vision as a garden city and see itself as a world leading

21995 :  even if our main crops are not coming from the forest gardens themselves the ecosystem services that a forest

21996 :  but a seed of doubt crossed my mind it was all well and good if this would work in the tropics but i was planning to

21997 :  the hawaiians were gardeners because rather than just arbitrarily putting up paddocks on the island they understood the

21998 :  its much easier for this peach tree to get the nutrients for the needs that it has and it can produce many more peaches as a

21999 :  all of these cultures would cultivate the whole landscape they were able to harvest from tree crops and because the

22000 :  the best studied examples include the oak woodlands of california the araucanian forests of chile

22001 :  if we are going to be able to produce the food we need in the future we need to do so in a way that supports and

22002 :  perennial agriculture doesnt happen overnight a model ecosystem doesnt work out of the box

22003 :  however when they returned the water that they used for irrigation to the river it was full of silt and very high in nutrients

22004 :  as a result canberra has an abundance of green space in our urban areas a much higher proportion than many

22005 :  because perennial plants grow for more than one year they tend to develop extensive root systems which reach deep down into the

22006 :  you see another trend about our food production was pointed out to me

22007 :  the hawaiians were gardeners because when they set out to discover the islands of hawaii they took with them in their canoes

22008 :  they slow down and clean up the water that goes down our drains before it gets to the lake

22009 :  if we start cultivating them in canberra today they will be online for us tomorrow and we will see

22010 :  pest control would be undertaken through the use of insecticides but these are known to kill off the pollinators that the peach

22011 :  if we are going to produce the food that we need in the future we need to bring food production into our cities so that cities are

22012 :  these ideas go beyond our backyard as an example of how forest gardening could apply to modern agriculture

22013 :  canberra has this potential given its history as a garden city

22014 :  we tend to think that these green spaces are ecologically intact but many of ours in canberra are ecological

22015 :  now if we went out and randomly selected some plants and started growing them in the same space its likely that wed

22016 :  there is one valley in california which produces thirty of the worlds almond crop so as you can imagine

22017 :  this is kind of like companion planting but on a much bigger scale

22018 :  if ive inspired you today you can go home and start forest gardening

22019 :  where did they make a few mistakes before they found the right answer

22020 :  what if they could reduce testing anxiety

22021 :  were letting our fear and our skepticism about these devices hold us back from realizing their

22022 :  i studied childrens literature because i was going to work with kids and books

22023 :  what if we start talking to kids regularly about the content on these screens

22024 :  and i walked in and was assigned a three year old named maria

22025 :  now i was perhaps an unlikely champion for this cause

22026 :  were creating mobile pieces like the trayvon martin piece

22027 :  ive had americans tell me that theyve donated direct deductions from their bank account money to go to syrian children

22028 :  named george zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him

22029 :  and i had a lot of people come out of that piece saying oh my god i was so frustrated

22030 :  i have to really follow best journalistic practices and make sure that these powerful

22031 :  until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling she was just crying

22032 :  but what do we do first

22033 :  in the next fifty years more than half of those

22034 :  some companies succeed

22035 :  for example if that is true a bus with eighty passengers has a right to eighty times

22036 :  some people must make more money some others less

22037 :  and in fact in my studies of five thousand people every year i ask them what are you looking for

22038 :  i then put that questionnaire on various dating sites in forty
22039 :  mens jobs became more important they had to move the rocks fell the trees plow the land

22040 :  what about the late 1940s when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had

22041 :  i was with his family in his final moments before we withdrew his life support

22042 :  it was difficult to function normally at home and it was very difficult to go back to work

22043 :  at some point each one of us will be profoundly affected by illness be it in

22044 :  but for this patient his family and for all of us when we find ourselves in this kind of

22045 :  but it was also the moment when i learned my next life giving lesson from my

22046 :  marion conti ohare is a nurse researcher who developed this perspective into a theory known as the

22047 :  when i spend an entire twelve hour shift with a patient who just a few days

22048 :  i wouldnt want to contradict that

22049 :  i think actually thats very good advice

22050 :  but things get even more complicated

22051 :  that still sounds a little technical i know

22052 :  if you ask most parents they say yes we did pretty much the same thing

22053 :  and it turns out people did not like going to those open spaces

22054 :  can we play that one

22055 :  its called jaws job access with speech and it sounds like this

22056 :  i didnt have to be nice to people

22057 :  i want to thank her too

22058 :  thank you very much

22059 :  one is another american inventor ted henter

22060 :  i love stories

22061 :  im going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it

22062 :  i slowed it down for you

22063 :  well because we cant transport books across borders there had to be separate versions read in all the

22064 :  in no other latin american country are there more than a couple of thousand

22065 :  it had a speech synthesizer

22066 :  many websites we cant read using jaws and the other technologies

22067 :  computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world but i think theyve changed the lives of we

22068 :  for example australia like about one third of the worlds countries has copyright

22069 :  in short doing everything that a cartoonist should be able to do in a free society

22070 :  dont like share retweet call me names without at least thinking

22071 :  i dont know who talks like that but thats just in my mind

22072 :  something we all drink every day

22073 :  your mind does not respond well to stress

22074 :  we used to believe that bloodletting a

22075 :  a marketers job is to sell product or to push a brand and they do

22076 :  do i even need these antibiotics

22077 :  oftentimes these ika experts will tout a single study and try

22078 :  take september 11th two thousand and one in new york city one of the worst terrorist attacks of all

22079 :  lets stop this hypothetical for a second

22080 :  we live in a fast paced world

22081 :  look i get it

22082 :  in one thousand nine hundred and eightyone the new york times published a study that said two cups of coffee

22083 :  ask hey doc why do i need these antibiotics

22084 :  note that newer studies are not necessarily better than older studies

22085 :  you say i have a respiratory virus

22086 :  its a combination of studies not just one which allows for the decreased likelihood of

22087 :  and here ill tell you how to do that

22088 :  know that the best form of research is a metaanalysis

22089 :  it can guide us it can put itself into the context of the entire body of evidence

22090 :  a doctor prescribes a treatment or tells you not to go for a treatment

22091 :  you might think of that as the privatization of war

22092 :  but the stage is crowded

22093 :  for one thing germany had surpassed britain in industrial strength by one thousand nine hundred
22094 :  the states not alone

22095 :  first of all its a linear projection

22096 :  power is multi polar

22097 :  the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about

22098 :  keeping balances is important

22099 :  the state still matters

22100 :  hard power is there and it will remain

22101 :  if they have the price of entry into an internet cafe the last time i looked it was something like a pound an

22102 :  the bottom board of this three dimensional the board of transnational relations things that

22103 :  and you can think back to one thousand nine hundred and fortyone when the government of japan attacked the united states

22104 :  now i dont mean to be pollyannaish about this

22105 :  there are many many actors

22106 :  the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers

22107 :  its not just prevailing at war though war still persists

22108 :  so weve got what seventeen more years to go or so before chinas bigger

22109 :  all this still persists

22110 :  and what that means is not that the age of the state is over

22111 :  notice both halves of that explanation

22112 :  and thats the good news i have

22113 :  for example the great oxford historian who taught here at this university a

22114 :  china still has large areas of underdevelopment and per capita income is a better measure of

22115 :  and as i said earlier china has not passed the united states

22116 :  so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon

22117 :  thucydides the great historian of the the peloponnesian war said it was the rise in the power of

22118 :  and that the chinese wont catch up or pass the americans until somewhere in the latter part after

22119 :  power is chaotically distributed

22120 :  let me give you an example from history

22121 :  its bad history

22122 :  but we need a new narrative if were to understand power in the 21st century

22123 :  and the only way you can solve these problems and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century

22124 :  and in the 21st century you have to do an analog to that

22125 :  to paraphrase franklin roosevelt from a different context the greatest thing we have to fear

22126 :  there are balancers the u

22127 :  in fact they dont even have to acknowledge that theyve done anything wrong

22128 :  its not very heavy i can do it without any problem but nonetheless i like to hold onto it

22129 :  is that even ethical

22130 :  and that was a red flag for me because thats my area of specialty and i thought maybe theres a way in which we can

22131 :  i dont know

22132 :  there are two types of economic modeling

22133 :  how does he do it what do you mean model

22134 :  i felt that most of us at our core are moderates

22135 :  most of us arent not going to forgo the livelihoods of our friends and family for ideology

22136 :  were peoples beliefs consistent with how public policy would impact them

22137 :  you know bad idea

22138 :  what is it really

22139 :  god made it

22140 :  thats how powerful god is

22141 :  and indeed i would say thats the reality we live in

22142 :  he doesnt need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of

22143 :  they dont have any ontic cloud of their own

22144 :  why do you exist

22145 :  they cant call a world into existence out of nothingness

22146 :  it was towards the end of the 17th century the philosopher leibniz who asked it a

22147 :  john archibald wheeler one of the great physicists of the 20th century the teacher of richard feynman the

22148 :  and by the way this is what most americans today believe

22149 :  he can make it out of sheer nothingness creation ex nihilo

22150 :  they dont exist outside the world

22151 :  he sees physical laws as being like divine commands

22152 :  and i know you feel it

22153 :  and ive no doubt there are five einsteins in the audience tonight

22154 :  now whats in between these two extremes

22155 :  now if youre a buddhist you might want to stop right there because essentially what youve got is

22156 :  thats a very primitive view of what a scientific law is

22157 :  its obsessed great thinkers

22158 :  thats what science is telling us

22159 :  also a younger physicist max tegmark who believes that all

22160 :  so we dont want to live in that special reality

22161 :  what breathes fire into the equations and creates a world for them to describe

22162 :  the fullest possible reality thats special

22163 :  its just a big cosmic vacuity

22164 :  but i will tell you something to conclude that i guarantee you will astonish you because its astonished

22165 :  thats the cosmic question it sort of rhymes with a more intimate question why do i exist

22166 :  do we want to live in a special reality

22167 :  now that last one thats a really important one

22168 :  i mean every last drop

22169 :  but what if he worked in the opposite direction

22170 :  the progress is relentless

22171 :  people dont build anything this way

22172 :  so our groups role and our groups mission is to innovate by employing carbon nanotubes because we think that

22173 :  we were trying to make blazing fast computers using nanomaterials

22174 :  when i was a graduate student it was one of the most exciting times to be working in nanotechnology

22175 :  thats exactly what weve done in our lab

22176 :  we dont have any disease fighting nanobots theres no elevators to space and the thing that im most interested

22177 :  so because of that all of the promise and all of the excitement has remained just that promise and excitement

22178 :  it couldnt do anything that your smartphone does

22179 :  you would not be impressed

22180 :  there were scientific breakthroughs happening all the time

22181 :  now as odd as that sounds that is almost exactly the problem i work on in my lab

22182 :  we just have come to expect the pace of computing advancements to go on indefinitely

22183 :  this ideal solution contains a material thats impossible to work with

22184 :  shes been there for hundreds of millions of years

22185 :  its like in the godfather right

22186 :  lets just figure out whats missing

22187 :  what are we not dealing with

22188 :  what are we not doing but needs to be done to make this a success

22189 :  and its this convergence that gives us this incredible pace

22190 :  we just dont build anything this way

22191 :  i could work them just by my thoughts

22192 :  he feels light touch down to one gram of force

22193 :  and youve got one of these conventional arms

22194 :  you open it these muscles contract

22195 :  can we get more out of it

22196 :  he also required a revision surgery on his chest

22197 :  we talk with our hands

22198 :  i studied this peptide for two years

22199 :  so things kind of go out of date

22200 :  this is something familiar

22201 :  its a very hot place

22202 :  actually its the internet of everything

22203 :  when you have a smart person and you have smart infrastructure now you can develop innovation

22204 :  so what is this all about

22205 :  cities all over the world are costing a lot more money

22206 :  so if were trying to make robots that can be more expressive and that can connect better with us in society

22207 :  it knows how much its moving

22208 :  and by the way who in his right mind would argue against love of learning

22209 :  of course people want to reach safety and security and some of them are willing to put their lives at risk

22210 :  we do not read a lot about it in the mainstream media for a while it was in newspapers a lot not so

22211 :  but not for the people affected obviously

22212 :  was it because it was on principle

22213 :  germany is offering thirty thousand places on a very straightforward and simple resettlement scheme

22214 :  the estimate for this year is that it is going to be higher

22215 :  well we have canceled the sea rescue missions to help these people

22216 :  so we are trying to say well if he would not be deported now then surely he should be readmitted

22217 :  it is shaming frankly

22218 :  under a lot of pressure politicians did finally agree to a resettlement scheme and what has happened since then

22219 :  it is hard working with families where they have been split by the immigration rules where they are not able to live

22220 :  theyre stuck in a kafkaesque bureaucracy

22221 :  he has been away from his family now for several years they have had some really hard times this family they have had

22222 :  one hundred and fortythree here in the uk

22223 :  it has been just over a year now

22224 :  once she was there she was to spend two years in detention and she has only just been released

22225 :  one million in lebanon

22226 :  then last month to top it all we have stopped syrians who have got us visas who are traveling to the us

22227 :  i say a lot

22228 :  the minimum threshold is twelve months

22229 :  there is also no prospects of her being removed as far as we can tell

22230 :  so we went to the finance industry

22231 :  can we do the even harder thing

22232 :  i mean i didnt know what was going to happen to him

22233 :  all of our hopes and dreams what we want to accomplish is different and our paths will be different they are all stories

22234 :  so thank you

22235 :  we were at the beach he was raising his son and he was productive

22236 :  all of our statuses are different

22237 :  this paradoxical effect called the landau damping is one of the most important in plasma physics

22238 :  so what i want you to think about next time somebody wants to make some vast generalization about religion is that maybe

22239 :  despite the extraordinary things i was shooting and experiencing theyd started to feel a little bit ordinary to me

22240 :  the history of civilization in some ways is a history of maps how have we come to understand the world around us

22241 :  indeed weve worked out ways to make the stubborn the reluctant the hard to grow straight forward

22242 :  so with this great burden of responsibility it is important that we are ingenious growers of

22243 :  if ive really got you hooked perhaps you start supporting the cause that i work for

22244 :  it has more species of plants than the whole of europe put together

22245 :  a southern hemisphere landscape and an asian landscape

22246 :  well to be vulgar about it beauty sells doesnt it

22247 :  so im really excited

22248 :  its a way to bring power to the developing world because its produced in a factory and its cheap

22249 :  thats someone who is designing a habitat on another planets dream

22250 :  its still thermally hot but its not radioactive

22251 :  but i also have a personal stake in this

22252 :  i also think that the way were expecting it to change is broken

22253 :  if we sit around waiting for politicians and school systems and parents to change this

22254 :  a few years ago our research team found that thirty of women in the united states reported

22255 :  today for example i spent fifteen minutes just lying on the autumn leaves over in the

22256 :  its not about being selfish

22257 :  on a daily basis on a moment to moment basis

22258 :  some of us wont be here in a years time

22259 :  if i didnt try to incorporate them i too would regret that

22260 :  we can look back at mistakes weve made

22261 :  i want to honor where my heart is leading me

22262 :  if we can look at death and realize we are going to die

22263 :  and then i asked the usual question is it a priority

22264 :  i thought how much money do i have in my pocket

22265 :  its good for everybody

22266 :  hed doing quite well

22267 :  so we cannot stay here its dangerous

22268 :  i said no no no no we cant

22269 :  i said no you can imagine

22270 :  he told me hes at school

22271 :  that was my story

22272 :  the resulting inattention to local conflicts leads to inadequate peacebuilding in the short

22273 :  they had killed many men raped many women

22274 :  and reading that book made me reexamine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that

22275 :  what we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises who will

22276 :  the sum of the local is the global

22277 :  but im going to talk about l

22278 :  its not a competition with rural farm its actually reinforcements

22279 :  has its issues

22280 :  everybody knows about lead in smoking

22281 :  i dont know about you but im incredibly lazy when it comes to exercising

22282 :  you want someone who understands prevention understands nutrition understands exercise understands the importance of

22283 :  exercising for the sake of vanity never motivated me because i just figure plus or minus ten twenty pounds who cares

22284 :  if you dont have a lot of friends if you just moved if your friends are negative and youre getting rid of them after the last tips that

22285 :  org is great

22286 :  so you actually end up filling up with that and losing weight

22287 :  depending on who you ask only five to eight of alzheimers is linked to a single gene to begin with

22288 :  they found that the nuns who had the highest usage of positive emotion

22289 :  first off im not a doctor

22290 :  so pick any cause thats important to you and go out there and do it

22291 :  so learn ballroom dancing

22292 :  i know that sounds like a lot but actually its really hard to gain weight with fruits and vegetables

22293 :  you can learn a new instrument a complicated dance or language

22294 :  being social is incredibly good for you

22295 :  theres a website called cosmeticsdatabase

22296 :  someones texting in the car tell them to pull over

22297 :  they tracked six hundred thousand and seventyeight nuns over the course of their lives and a lot of the nuns even gave

22298 :  talk back to it

22299 :  so thats what were doing

22300 :  i make games for a living

22301 :  thats my job

22302 :  i mean our basic goal is to improve lives around the world

22303 :  theyre being poisoned

22304 :  stress rewires your brain

22305 :  if youre in l

22306 :  if you have a thyroid problem that actually makes the thyroid problem worse

22307 :  mediterranean diet involves seven to ten servings of fruits and vegetables per day

22308 :  aginggames and it was really stressful as i was reading the study about how stress shrinks your brain

22309 :  so its not good for you

22310 :  so always wear your seat belt

22311 :  i was working at this day job funding anti

22312 :  i ended up leaving shortly thereafter

22313 :  so dont worry too much about taking notes

22314 :  always pick a safer card make that one of your primary screenings and never text while youre driving

22315 :  in the us what that means is sponsoring alzheimers prevention research and

22316 :  so a good doctor knows that

22317 :  and a good doctor knows how to do that

22318 :  i want to talk to you about fear

22319 :  five earths to sustain this economy

22320 :  we need it to develop technology

22321 :  we can choose life over fear

22322 :  and these are not esoteric limits

22323 :  thats all true

22324 :  you might say that nonstandard like is all over the place

22325 :  not just in california

22326 :  these are the variable aspects

22327 :  and word order is one of those things

22328 :  anna on the other hand was the mother of two young children

22329 :  however there are many aspects of language where we do have a choice

22330 :  first of all we cant stop language changing

22331 :  something will happen behind it

22332 :  so when some very political exciting moments happened you can

22333 :  bric country means brazil russia india and china

22334 :  it became the media platform of three hundred million readers

22335 :  because in the meantime emissions will have accumulated

22336 :  some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century maybe much longer

22337 :  so this poses really big challenges for us

22338 :  all of that will take time

22339 :  theres sun beating down theres concrete and glass all around you

22340 :  she herself was a fierce voice and a powerful figure that fought not just for women but also

22341 :  what if that were the risk she took everyday just walking to school

22342 :  its almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry

22343 :  so im going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which hasnt been named before

22344 :  by the indians

22345 :  it was a very deliberate act

22346 :  now symmetry is almost natures language

22347 :  take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn then flip it

22348 :  and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects they both have six symmetries

22349 :  artists too love to play around with symmetry

22350 :  i create mathematical objects symmetrical objects using galois language in very high

22351 :  and he wrote to the academicians in paris trying to explain his theory

22352 :  if i told you twenty or less stand up

22353 :  embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness

22354 :  and we know thats a measurement error because its messing up my data

22355 :  and we tailor the class towards the average

22356 :  youve outlined all the negative things that can happen but not talked about the positive

22357 :  that undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles the way that we motivate our behavior

22358 :  did you see how you landed

22359 :  so i did the only thing my frantic seven year old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy

22360 :  whatever it is instead of deleting you what i want to do is study you

22361 :  and into the silence i said id be happy to speak at your school but thats not a wellness week thats a sickness week

22362 :  silence on the phone

22363 :  and if you have children youve seen this hundreds of times

22364 :  thank you very much

22365 :  you got good grades now you have to get better grades you got into a good school and after you get into a better one you got a good job now you have

22366 :  i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her

22367 :  and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies what weve found is we can reverse the formula for

22368 :  and if happiness is on the opposite side of success your brain never gets there

22369 :  we get people when they open up their inbox to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network

22370 :  and were so excited

22371 :  and friday night were trying to decide between risky sex or happiness

22372 :  theyre creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved besides voting or signing a

22373 :  we have thirtyone brigades in the u

22374 :  its about questioning existing ways of doing things

22375 :  so keep that in mind

22376 :  its about critical thinking

22377 :  and in many ways hacking is what built america

22378 :  its not a reductive label

22379 :  they both brought my brother and i up

22380 :  they both worked

22381 :  neither of my parents ever conformed to traditional gender roles

22382 :  but at all times youre learning by doing

22383 :  were mostly done building it and now were testing it

22384 :  we could do that

22385 :  unfortunately it would be extremely expensive

22386 :  now the problem is that ocr is not perfect

22387 :  and im going to break it down for you for just a second

22388 :  just be who you are

22389 :  and if you dont think you look good in something youre also probably right

22390 :  now the business model involves all of you

22391 :  the bar is called the miracle of science

22392 :  well they probably would keep this a secret until they turn the prototype drug into an active pharmaceutical

22393 :  we sent it to oxford england where a group of talented crystallographers provided this picture which helped us

22394 :  so we developed an idea a rationale that perhaps if we made a molecule that prevented the post it

22395 :  and were able finally to answer the question thats been so pressing for so many years why do i have

22396 :  so we did just the opposite

22397 :  we thought wed just send it to people and see how the molecule behaves

22398 :  this research is funded by the public

22399 :  yet comparatively we have about a dozen targeted medications

22400 :  and one thing ive learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer and i love that

22401 :  and often lifes truths can be established not by reason but by imagination

22402 :  and why not

22403 :  i was a reader before i became a writer

22404 :  there is hope

22405 :  his head did not move to the right

22406 :  one of the things that weve noticed specifically about this mechanism of injury is although theres a rapid

22407 :  and so that did something first that was a little counterintuitive

22408 :  people have tried other approaches with helmets

22409 :  and so what id like to do and i know that this is for some of you of more immediate nature ive got a couple years

22410 :  and this might be just a result of my own traumatic experience

22411 :  so what might be happening there

22412 :  so it rigidly couples to your skull and gives you the most precise possible measurement of how the skull moves

22413 :  now add to this research from the ngo bioversity international that shows a narrowing of variety in

22414 :  within this model seeds become non renewable resources inventions

22415 :  and that same company in two thousand and five acquired the worlds largest developer and grower of

22416 :  and one eighth of that population about one million people died when a pathogen wiped out

22417 :  let us make ourselves into vessels unbreakable so that we

22418 :  we had eight tiger sharks

22419 :  i was in south africa with mr

22420 :  all of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth

22421 :  so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice including several audio commentary tracks that id made for movies

22422 :  there was something comforting about a voice that was not my own

22423 :  it knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark

22424 :  one of the funniest blogs on the web is written by a friend of mine named smartass

22425 :  ironic that my legs are fine and its my shoulders that slow up my walk

22426 :  there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices and ive

22427 :  then apple released the alex voice which was the best id heard

22428 :  sam just keeps staring

22429 :  social anthropology is all about people

22430 :  so she tried some of the cooking apple

22431 :  and equally our aging brain loves it even more because it helps our aging brain stay healthy

22432 :  i was so fired up so fired up that i got home put the children to bed i was completely

22433 :  and i wasnt taking much notice because i was in too much of a foul mood by now

22434 :  both munchkin and bump have a very different experience of the bitter

22435 :  but of course the mother experiencing all those food for real is

22436 :  we now know that whatever we learn whatever we are doing whatever we are interacting with will

22437 :  as long as your are curious

22438 :  years ago when my children were really

22439 :  their curiosity was enormous

22440 :  i was age seven

22441 :  one of these games was

22442 :  within the fourth year i realised actually social anthropology was so hard that actually

22443 :  nothing is set in stone ever

22444 :  and my friend and this girl in the back were talking

22445 :  all the children had to sit on a circle and each child took in turns to be in the middle

22446 :  because i had small children i had to think about a university that was local to where i lived

22447 :  you can learn anything you can involve yourself in different kinds of social groups all sorts of stuff

22448 :  it was for yoga and meditation for adults and little people

22449 :  and it is not true

22450 :  so baby mumchkin has got these basic tastes going on

22451 :  so all is good

22452 :  so i found a university that did social anthropology and i had to choose it with another subject so i chose it with

22453 :  because i can pinpoint the exact day when i first realised that my core of my very being was

22454 :  ive got to go traffic is building up

22455 :  she started to explain it and the more she explained the more questions i asked

22456 :  but sometimes i think that yes those things do restrict us but not as much as we like to think they do

22457 :  the whole weekend was like that

22458 :  we went on friday night due to come home on thesunday

22459 :  please stay curious

22460 :  i actually went on this weekend with a friend

22461 :  i shoot shot right back to then and i thought

22462 :  curiosity and wanting to find out about things is a massive motivator and it also stimulates the reward

22463 :  the point is the menu is infinite

22464 :  thank you very much

22465 :  because what there is at the end of it is inestimable

22466 :  they had embraced this whole new world

22467 :  and now the taste is properly formed so the baby can taste things through the amniotic sac

22468 :  so theres help for munchkin because munchkin is coming along now

22469 :  the combination of all these things is absolutely massive

22470 :  mumchkin is born

22471 :  i wouldnt be

22472 :  older parents younger children

22473 :  because it is just a list

22474 :  and you know what else

22475 :  the first five basic flavors are

22476 :  she was taking ages and ages to come out after saying goodbye to all these people

22477 :  it might be that

22478 :  but in that same weekend i learned something about my own curiosity

22479 :  we have got this wonderful menu of all the things or menus of all these equations of things we can do in life

22480 :  and certainly in embryology and in biological sciences in genetics we can see all sorts of things happening

22481 :  but essentially recognizable through life

22482 :  we see sufferings we see lives changed in an instant and it can happen to anyone

22483 :  and i said we dont walk away because we have now the technology and twenty years

22484 :  from the embryo to death

22485 :  i would get to the top of the mountain twenty years more no trouble we plant the flag at the top of the mountain but my

22486 :  im a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and for the last thirty years ive spent my whole

22487 :  and then the healing goes on as ive described

22488 :  where could we get the skin from

22489 :  but it gives us an opportunity for life if we can seal that surface we are safe and we can have that

22490 :  trying to understand what was going on

22491 :  the scars will never leave him

22492 :  the time taken to make sure those cells were on the right way up fixing each patch onto

22493 :  how could we shorten that three weeks

22494 :  just bear one second a fraction of a second for half your body being burnt

22495 :  weve got the cells in the place

22496 :  where did i start to think that we could do better

22497 :  if you heal a burn within ten days you get a four risk of scarring if you heal a burn within twentyone days

22498 :  theyve got to look and see where else they can find information

22499 :  so where to now

22500 :  what self organizes this systems

22501 :  and so we started doing experiments around this

22502 :  ive said already one day in a burns unit is a day too long

22503 :  and we try to seal that surface so once we got that surface sealed were safe

22504 :  we have the pain we still have infection as the biggest killer we have to seal the skin over as the

22505 :  well we started looking

22506 :  and so i put it to you

22507 :  those cells under normal conditions will keep us whole

22508 :  how could we stop that

22509 :  because as weve changed the goalpost people survive more and more and more massive injuries

22510 :  people die waiting

22511 :  somewhat less than subtle

22512 :  taking it from there putting in a soup trying to keep the soup under the dressings

22513 :  but five days is a long time

22514 :  what create what self organizing systems makes me this shape

22515 :  that tomorrow every morning when you get up its the start of a new journey

22516 :  and i recently had coffee with a patient i met in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone 1st of october in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyone
22517 :  at that stage you gain a whole raft of more experiments to do

22518 :  now we may step back from this and think wow what is it that we do

22519 :  i see peoples lives that have changed in an instant

22520 :  it hit me straight between the eyes that this boy would never move properly again he would

22521 :  so how did we achieve that

22522 :  and so we started in the skin lab in one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree and our first sheets we grew in ten days

22523 :  so how when we get bigger and bigger burns were in a situation where technologies are advancing we know the

22524 :  and so traditionally when i started over thirty years ago we would take the surface of the skin just

22525 :  they grew it into sheets that came back

22526 :  by meshing it out

22527 :  he had ninetytwo body surface area burns and i was expected to walk away

22528 :  when you treat somebody with burns its a massive juggling exercise

22529 :  and we take that out its like a bread and butter sandwich and we could peel those slices of the skin apart

22530 :  and were chasing that illusive goal for more complex situations

22531 :  why wait three weeks

22532 :  each little cell can cover much greater area than when we coalesce them into a sheet

22533 :  when he only had eight of his body left

22534 :  so we grew skin cells into sheets

22535 :  as memories rose to the surface they had to face those memories

22536 :  it requires one hundred hours of meditation in silence and stillness over a ten day period of

22537 :  but when i first started documenting this story i thought maybe the dhamma brothers can become teachers

22538 :  so finally in that moment with that wise advise he sat and went inside and faced himself

22539 :  the staff wasnt safe

22540 :  nobody felt safe

22541 :  at the end of the thirty hours their minds were sharp and focused and on

22542 :  when the mind wonders they have to come back to the breath over and over and over again

22543 :  he was squirming jumping and running from the mat

22544 :  wayne was unable to sit and focus

22545 :  the prisoners werent safe

22546 :  big ed had to face the that his daughter had died

22547 :  everybody was thinking

22548 :  nobody wanted to work there it was always understaffed because nobody wanted to go to donaldson

22549 :  they couldnt be provoked or upset so easily

22550 :  and that they can be confident that the sacrifices that they make and indeed we all make will be worth it in the

22551 :  and they are less likely to make sacrifices in their careers

22552 :  but far from being innate the research suggests that these decisions and these

22553 :  they are more likely to feel that they have a poor work life balance

22554 :  who is willing to make sacrifices for their career

22555 :  that they can imagine succeeding in those roles

22556 :  i think the first of these is that work life balance is not just about women

22557 :  so it seems that maybe its just quite simple women just dont make these sacrifices

22558 :  long hours night shifts and you dont get anymore unpredictable hours than midwifery

22559 :  it doesnt solve any problems

22560 :  but instead judge people by their actions and not by their faith

22561 :  because we know what to expect

22562 :  children are not adults

22563 :  we can begin to study the dynamic response of the body to a drug

22564 :  this is a disease that affects a large number of individuals

22565 :  theyve even tried to grow little mini organs in the lab

22566 :  you wont find many clinical trials in which children are involved yet every day we give

22567 :  tends to be middle aged tends to be female

22568 :  fifteen minutes later i was on my way to the emergency room with a full blown asthma attack

22569 :  when they get damaged say by cigarette smoke for example they dont work properly and they

22570 :  plug and play

22571 :  our cells experience that

22572 :  i took some advil

22573 :  we can make it better

22574 :  very expensive they sold them out for money then cutting trees again

22575 :  i brought my japanese students to work with the chinese students

22576 :  in one month we completed nine classrooms over five hundred square meters

22577 :  so i remember it was so disappointing

22578 :  and i was very lucky

22579 :  those are invisible

22580 :  after the building was recycled

22581 :  he said as long as you bring your money you can do it

22582 :  or that clapping game how about that one

22583 :  i was fortunate to train with dr

22584 :  what is happening in first play

22585 :  there is a tremendous amount of positive sensory input

22586 :  or pre symbolic play

22587 :  lewis wrote about it in his book the four loves

22588 :  its important for me to mention these are not my original ideas i stand on the shoulders of giants

22589 :  and especially so when it comes to love

22590 :  so someone else does the job instead of you

22591 :  without the fall there is no falling in love

22592 :  subcontracting is when on the one hand you get rid of the risk and on the other hand you lower the costs

22593 :  what does it mean

22594 :  ok you might pose the question

22595 :  so what terms such as outsourcing or subcontracting exemplify is that

22596 :  thanks a lot

22597 :  but what all these new trends and all these new technologies reinforce today in the 21st

22598 :  so what all these examples show especially masturdating and solo wedding is that we are

22599 :  this is the newest trend from several weeks ago in love affairs

22600 :  why did he die

22601 :  its at youtube

22602 :  the iphone the ibook the ipad

22603 :  why are you laughing

22604 :  so they brought another one

22605 :  what did this mean

22606 :  because this is the way they traffic in story

22607 :  i have a story

22608 :  when they gathered some hundred children into this small library the librarian introduced me as

22609 :  the answers are in all of our backyards

22610 :  sustainability is not about seeing the environmental issues that are facing our society today

22611 :  and so its kind of no wonder gojo is an early adopter of biomimicry since after all

22612 :  one of the first tasks that i was assigned when i started at gojo was to lead a biomimicry

22613 :  and they walked away from these impacts unscathed because their spines have evolved impressive shock absorbing

22614 :  but is this the only thing

22615 :  call your parents thats why they bought this for you

22616 :  so can we use light

22617 :  so thats a big challenge

22618 :  now the challenge is

22619 :  thats the question to ask

22620 :  thats how amazing these technologies have become

22621 :  hes rich hes spoiled he can have anybody he wants he can do anything he wants and she wants him all to herself

22622 :  and so shiva once again came to the rescue

22623 :  lets start at the beginning lets start with the story of creation

22624 :  lets go back to this plan

22625 :  he realized what kind of sin he had brought into the world

22626 :  i love this one the best

22627 :  some things make sense ok you know

22628 :  the king put out a reward

22629 :  this is how you create a being thats both man and woman in one body

22630 :  and that is a story thats becoming completely obsolete

22631 :  and for this world that he was going to create he was going to populate it with beings that were both man and

22632 :  and she says well i am completely fed up because in all my life theres

22633 :  otherwise you might damage the paper and the paper dots

22634 :  it would now tell me and you

22635 :  please keep them on until i ask you to remove them

22636 :  try it in a fun way and thinking of what can i do

22637 :  this year ive completed the sequel baking with feeling

22638 :  perfect for my jacket

22639 :  how do blind people read

22640 :  it makes a big difference whether youre blind or visually impaired

22641 :  during my study it was called a cookbook for the visual impaired

22642 :  i still remember one of them with a smile

22643 :  for the time being youll have to make due with my voice just like the visually impaired

22644 :  my first question again those plastic pages

22645 :  my idea was born

22646 :  and maybe just maybe this ted talk will be a one little step in that

22647 :  theyre made from plastic and you can use them in the garden

22648 :  i mean look if youve done nothing wrong youve got nothing to worry about

22649 :  seven million documents

22650 :  the worlds library is amazon

22651 :  i wouldnt use patriot and i wouldnt use traitor

22652 :  tim actually would you like to come up and say do we have a microphone for tim

22653 :  surely that makes it a price worth paying

22654 :  some are responsible

22655 :  so i would like to welcome to the ted stage the man behind those revelations

22656 :  and as my image is already inside the paper i just have to

22657 :  so as you can guess my mother tongue is french

22658 :  obviously there were

22659 :  and the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history

22660 :  they say what did the doctor say

22661 :  we provided some of the scietific input and fact checking and so forth and this now has

22662 :  some of you may have lost parents prematurely to that cardiovascular disease epidemic

22663 :  we have about three
22664 :  some of you may remember that

22665 :  but just a reminder

22666 :  im one hundred mobile i have no settled domicile but maybe thats another ted talk

22667 :  and thats the reason why you want to keep it

22668 :  because theres no question where i have my documents if they are lying on my desk if i have them in the drawer

22669 :  i had the feeling that i needed to go out of my comfort zone that id work further on my new company

22670 :  it never quite worked actually

22671 :  a few years ago i printed out a seven hundred and fifty page tutorial how to

22672 :  i did it myself

22673 :  i was cutting the lawn and i was watering the flowers and stuff and from my first salary i bought

22674 :  im much more interested in the bigger scale

22675 :  i tried it a few times because i wanted to fly as him

22676 :  so today is the day of the exponential change conference and im sure we hear a lot of really interesting

22677 :  i will tell you

22678 :  dont expect companies to help you fight homelessness

22679 :  was it easy

22680 :  i was auditioning for something about twentyfive years ago and i was walking down this hall and i was standing with a

22681 :  i thank you

22682 :  its an extraordinary thing

22683 :  now i learned how not to vibrate with the unknown and well talk about that in a second

22684 :  thats a big buzzword right now

22685 :  i believe in you

22686 :  you vibrate with the unknown

22687 :  i desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the internet

22688 :  i really wanted to be freed from relying on someone

22689 :  they have lower self esteem

22690 :  theyre more easily influenced by people around them and theyre at greater risk of depression

22691 :  but boys are not immune to this either

22692 :  im sure we all know what improvisation is right

22693 :  ive got these slides that i have to use so thats one rule ive got these slides in order

22694 :  what play becomes as we get older as we take it more seriously it becomes the opposite of play which is work which everybody

22695 :  because but is a contradiction whereas and is some sort of connection

22696 :  so thank you very much everyone

22697 :  let me define what i mean by game here

22698 :  yeah there you are sexy

22699 :  we just did that

22700 :  you might not believe it but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment

22701 :  and i began to daydream

22702 :  its okay to go back there as long as you dont get stuck there

22703 :  and im sure weve all felt moments like that

22704 :  so why all the negative connotation with nostalgia

22705 :  but dont get me wrong theres a lot about being thirteen that i do not miss

22706 :  we had so much interest we had to have end of the year banquet where everyone in attendance got an award it was a

22707 :  the great thing about a simple idea is that you dont need a lot to accomplish it

22708 :  it was supposed to be a mock yacht club where we wore sperrys and talk about boating and just like be really chill

22709 :  we bring in monthly guest speakers

22710 :  then we learned that hammocking actually has health benefits and we started to work with actual health professionals to track sway

22711 :  our goal was only fifty dollars so really wasnt that hard to do but to being ridiculous like

22712 :  we do charity events

22713 :  we got other friends and other high schools involved and we ended up hosting the midwest high school croquet

22714 :  how much room is that

22715 :  and in fact you can just look at pizza delivery drivers

22716 :  ive had someone write and say scientifically speaking what is the best and fastest way to hide a

22717 :  and we could be nudging kids like will off of the path that were on

22718 :  we could be providing special schools at both the high school level and the middle school level but even in

22719 :  it means that its in the low sixty percent

22720 :  the problem is that there were way more guys on death row than there were lawyers who had both the interest and the

22721 :  theres still time to nudge them if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them

22722 :  do you know what all time low in texas means

22723 :  thats the corner i want to explore

22724 :  it could be practicing gratitude like i do

22725 :  what about messi

22726 :  and instead of spending time with my wife i still checked my e mails every two

22727 :  second thing i learned

22728 :  you could say i was practically addicted to it

22729 :  and this ritual has helped me to see that

22730 :  so i knew exactly how to become happy but i failed to live by these insights

22731 :  a self help book on public speaking

22732 :  of course not

22733 :  i was completely immersed in the rat race to endless self improvement

22734 :  here is a ritual that works for me

22735 :  so i became vegan

22736 :  i remember i was having a coffee with one of the most successful comics in the country and their advice to me was stay in the

22737 :  and i need you guys to participate here

22738 :  coming out can be like cliff jumping

22739 :  we are all different and we are all the same

22740 :  hed come in blaring the bollywood top forty lg

22741 :  it was so difficult

22742 :  when i finish the sentence i need you guys to gasp alright

22743 :  she became my wife

22744 :  every single show i would make some joke about being gay

22745 :  so i decided i was going to start doing stand up when i was sixteen years old

22746 :  these chicks beside me judging

22747 :  people dont want to hate they want to love

22748 :  there were no mindy kalings or russell peters there were just apus from the simpsons

22749 :  some comics go for laughter i go for that special silence where you can hear all the equipment in the room

22750 :  the terrorists have arrived

22751 :  dad isnt that letting the wrong people win

22752 :  i wasnt writing i wasnt flowing i was clogging myself up so i decided i was on a colleage tour in the states

22753 :  its important for developing imagination and having an imaginative mind is

22754 :  it seemed like such an unfair and inaccurate portrayal of a population of women who

22755 :  but then as soon as you graduate college it seems like this whole set of standards

22756 :  this is what we call these women in my tribe in kenya

22757 :  so when they ask you who youre going to vote for what theyre really asking is who do you want to see and we already know that the show is run

22758 :  maybe theres a different way to do that

22759 :  i did some research

22760 :  remember the uproar when facebook starting messing with their privacy settings

22761 :  politicians can do that because they have faith that the polls are accurate

22762 :  how many of you became familiar with the presidential candidate you voted for during the debates at some point

22763 :  why would you vote for somebody you havent seen somebody you havent gotten to know

22764 :  people can vote for whoever they want

22765 :  but in the buildup to an election whats happening is that youre getting called on the phone and being asked to give away

22766 :  they want to find out they ask people thats fine you should give the correct answer then

22767 :  how do we get to know these people how do we get to see them

22768 :  it would just throw away my vote

22769 :  if the polls tell them the right lie then all they have to do is always give the right lie

22770 :  when do you see people

22771 :  if you want to find out a politicians stance on a position make the polls inaccurate and youll find

22772 :  so to draw it all back what im asking you to do overall is to think about the consequences that your answers have

22773 :  people want to know how to vote for a bill

22774 :  the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us but its not the complete

22775 :  and there are a couple of answers to that question

22776 :  he was the most respected scientist in the field

22777 :  i dont know if we named the apple or if the apple named us but

22778 :  and so they have to come to the table as well

22779 :  these two countries completely different political models and completely different economic models and yet they have the same income

22780 :  they are also getting really sick when they arrive because there is no clean water at their school

22781 :  we got sort of doodled scribbled cards back from the students in africa saying

22782 :  all of that stuff a few years ago

22783 :  thank you so much for this

22784 :  so as i thought through that and thought how can i avoid this from ever happening again i got into an even messier

22785 :  why dont we collect some books

22786 :  i ended up working on a public health issue where the smoking rates and smoking

22787 :  we packed them up packaged them year on year sent them out

22788 :  you can use the markets to incentivize good behaviors and good outcomes

22789 :  and it was fun it was exciting it was ad hoc it was reactive

22790 :  they might need more books if theyve been destroyed by the storm

22791 :  thank you so much for the work that you have done

22792 :  we need entrepreneurs but not everyone is an entrepreneur

22793 :  and its not about being young it wasnt about that passion it was actually about the fact that we didnt

22794 :  and a lot of people maybe you are thinking

22795 :  sometimes it is really good to take people out of their comfort zone and really introduce them to the kind of individuals

22796 :  the third option that one could consider is going into a big corporate a big bank

22797 :  you also need to recognize it is a tool and that we need to use it well and it is an entry point

22798 :  it was going so well that we set our sights globally

22799 :  how could they be selling products that were so harmful

22800 :  i look forward to hearing about your journey

22801 :  when i say school i actually mean they are studying in chicken coops they dont really have a

22802 :  ninety of the smokers started before the age of eighteen
22803 :  or how about we knit hats for kids with cancer

22804 :  how business can be a force for good lets say was the title

22805 :  ok i am going to run off and be an entrepreneur

22806 :  so it started with my volunteer group as in us for them lets give them crayons and we

22807 :  my mum has been diagnosed with breast cancer

22808 :  this activism became an us versus them

22809 :  we went city by city state by state rallying to get smoke free workplaces to

22810 :  so while they really appreciate those crayons im just wondering if you might be able to help us out with a

22811 :  this is a bigger problem than just us

22812 :  thank you very much

22813 :  i was sitting next to a tobacco industry executive

22814 :  i sat down on that panel i said it to her i dont think she took it up but i said it anyway and from

22815 :  they become more assertive

22816 :  we have very little leeway

22817 :  i want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brothers wedding

22818 :  the problem is that when our range narrows that produces something called the low power

22819 :  ok that shirt

22820 :  this pant or that pant

22821 :  power comes in lots of forms

22822 :  and through these experiences ive come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable

22823 :  but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered theres one situation where women get the same

22824 :  so we worried

22825 :  this shirt or that shirt

22826 :  thats what happened with my wife and i

22827 :  they smiled a big beaming smile

22828 :  how do we do that

22829 :  the company was so offended they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing

22830 :  and he said the lighter your touch the better you become at improving and enriching your

22831 :  and the answers are always the same

22832 :  well one of the ways is be a mama bear

22833 :  there have been multiple times in life when i have been forewarned that a low power person

22834 :  they said my eyes lit up

22835 :  within months he regained his self confidence and with winning dressage

22836 :  the work is very practical and i consider myself a grounded person so i was feeling

22837 :  i could share so many other stories with you

22838 :  i thought this is going to help me with morgan so i went along

22839 :  he showed me he woke nickys father up in the night by walking over him

22840 :  i know this now

22841 :  one winter day a few years ago i was sitting at my kitchen table writing about what had happened

22842 :  now when we are anxious over choices sometimes we easily give our power of choice away

22843 :  now you will be surprised that a majority of our audience did not think that what theyd

22844 :  was a completely random paper

22845 :  now we delivered the conference in such a way

22846 :  now manya became so successful in selling cars that soon she moved on to selling airplanes

22847 :  and for me its very shocking to see sometimes very poor people for example not supporting the idea

22848 :  they couldnt believe that speaking from the position of authority like two professors we

22849 :  now in regard to the current economic crisis we think that we will just wake up again

22850 :  also we are choosing by looking at what others are choosing

22851 :  first i realized a lot of choice i make is not rational

22852 :  but what you are buying now is great

22853 :  other families developed alternative anti racist personas

22854 :  so first i met a woman by the name of do a elena

22855 :  their assumption was that this child would eventually grow up to be dark skinned

22856 :  sure enough i found a number of examples that resonated with what ana had said to me

22857 :  as it relates to race in particular families can certainly protect family members against

22858 :  what this suggested to me is that honest portrayal of families was a partial one

22859 :  im afraid they will love her more

22860 :  so what does that mean

22861 :  but not just that it must also promote concrete public policies concrete

22862 :  the question that drives my work is whether or not it might be true that what

22863 :  fifty you dont even know

22864 :  very healthy celery

22865 :  mom was a celery

22866 :  everything is natural

22867 :  it was the flavor of the day in the 60s and 70s

22868 :  people dont do that

22869 :  im just going to walk

22870 :  if i dont drive its going to take me three hours to get home

22871 :  but you never have an odd number of copies

22872 :  driving is dangerous

22873 :  so you dont have a steak

22874 :  you can have an accident

22875 :  in the end he was only ready one minute early but it didn t matter because she arrived one minute late

22876 :  he thought of her every second every minute every hour

22877 :  i like people

22878 :  there d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch and who ignored the peoples protests about all the paper cuts then

22879 :  i mean this girl was wicked so he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits

22880 :  and though at the time he felt stupid and dumb for trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum he should have been comforted by the simple sum

22881 :  but i wouldn t wanna deal with all the paper people politics

22882 :  maybe pop up purple paper people

22883 :  and in a pop up population people s problems pop up too

22884 :  people who are capable of genuine forgiveness

22885 :  and what it also means is you can win

22886 :  thank you for being here

22887 :  a little paper me

22888 :  who every single day since i was born have taken time out of their morning to pray for me

22889 :  they said his head was up in space and they would bring him down to earth essentially he came from nothing and that is what he was

22890 :  yes the sunshine kid was bright with a warm personality and inside he burned

22891 :  they d be purple paper people

22892 :  he inspired many other people to come to galaxy zoo and join in

22893 :  we decided to call for help

22894 :  we set up a web site called galaxy zoo

22895 :  and then we made the nice image so that they could try and image what that planet was like

22896 :  and so we needed a new solution

22897 :  the problem is that we dont really like the universe that weve ended up with

22898 :  something else very interesting happens when you invite hundreds of thousands of people to take part in your research

22899 :  this is what it looks like today

22900 :  what you have to do instead is look for the indirect signs that theyre there

22901 :  this is a problem that confronts scientists in field after field after field

22902 :  weve got this ninetysix of the universe in a form that we dont understand

22903 :  and planet hunters 1b is currently a unique world

22904 :  we didnt know it was there

22905 :  and its no exaggeration to say its going provide a movie of the universe

22906 :  but theres a problem

22907 :  maybe they can classify the routine events

22908 :  we could pay attention to what it is that machines can do

22909 :  but because we had so many eyes and we could pay individual attention to each image we were able to

22910 :  i love for men to open the door for me but i insist on carrying my own luggage

22911 :  had i forgotten to teach self pride

22912 :  had i forgotten to teach feminism

22913 :  i think in my opinion humans want the world to be safe and small and so our language oftentimes reflects that

22914 :  and im not going to any black college for that matter

22915 :  i thought maybe i had done something wrong as a parent

22916 :  i threw away the toothbrushes with princesses on them and brought in the ones with spider man

22917 :  i make my bed five minutes after i wake up in the morning

22918 :  i could only think about gender like what is a man

22919 :  so i rarely understand them anyway

22920 :  so in my family hair is love

22921 :  and penelope without missing a beat said no mama i dont feel like a boy

22922 :  i heard a quote that i really like

22923 :  they tell us if we can inter be if we can get along

22924 :  but eventually i had to let georgia to find female blackness for herself and then support it

22925 :  i tossed out the shiny mary janes and brought in the timberland boots

22926 :  well be able to imagine beyond

22927 :  as a woman as a black person i know what its like to be mislabelled

22928 :  not everyone in my house agrees on the topic of gender and i allow for that

22929 :  this is the way god made me

22930 :  go beyond what youve been taught to be as a woman and be anything or everything

22931 :  theyre kind of like the how and the why we tick

22932 :  baby would you like to change your name to something more boyish something that can allow people to

22933 :  most people think that surviving instead of living is the only option

22934 :  its hard to describe what happened in that space and time

22935 :  i start to look around and i see what everybody else has

22936 :  is it possible that we could change our lives and find that purpose meaning and joy

22937 :  and about an hour after that we were invited to go back and see him

22938 :  id like to challenge you to go meatless for the rest of the day

22939 :  and after not one but two suicide attempts i had reached a fork in the road

22940 :  this doesnt have to be about hippies and tree hugging and tofu eating because honestly

22941 :  but it takes eight hundred and fifty gallons of water to grow eight ounces of beef

22942 :  i was terrified too

22943 :  thats a half a gram of protein per pound of body weight per day to repair for my tough

22944 :  because thats important

22945 :  that is the water that takes to water those soy beans to grow

22946 :  but the tide was low and the sun was really hot and the starfish it seemed they were doomed

22947 :  well i just never looked back

22948 :  in a very real sense we were refusing to live in an english only world

22949 :  temporary relief comes by allowing people time out in a language in which they can rest

22950 :  i labour still at the edges of her language managing a few rote lane sentences of

22951 :  in other readings it warns of arrogance of pride in grand achievements

22952 :  at the bottom it says

22953 :  my experiences of befriending those awaiting deportation together with my experience of researching

22954 :  and im hopelessly bad at this

22955 :  and it makes us both laugh when i do

22956 :  so to present a talk in english is to continue the structures of inequality and injustice

22957 :  one of the things he told me is that hes evolving from being an animal into trying to be a human

22958 :  the electric fence

22959 :  the electrified fence that surrounds the camp

22960 :  and no one is thinking that north korea is on the verge of collapse but totalitarian systems dont last

22961 :  hed been educated in the former soviet union

22962 :  he refused to look at her

22963 :  he says that hes physically outside but not psychologically outside barbed wire

22964 :  shin did not hesitate though

22965 :  they have a hard time distinguishing between criticism and betrayal

22966 :  almost all of them have been examined by government psychiatrists and psychologists in south korea who say that

22967 :  let me ask you how many of you knew before i started talking that there are concentration camps in north korea

22968 :  there are twentyfour thousand north koreans now living in south korea

22969 :  before his mother died she tried to catch his eye

22970 :  almost all of them have come there in the past twelve years

22971 :  so thats to be rich not to have to wake up in the morning

22972 :  it would be a disaster

22973 :  i have seen one olympic ceremony and it was awful

22974 :  i can do the advertising for the olympic games if you want

22975 :  and he did he jumped backwards

22976 :  so democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices

22977 :  we felt that they were out of date

22978 :  or how could we have better prepared for that

22979 :  if i ask you to think of their narratives the west being at war with islam the need to defend islam against the west these

22980 :  whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level rather than merely on a political level a level

22981 :  at the age of nineteen i was on the national leadership of this organization in the u

22982 :  and i was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders and i witnessed the rise of islamist

22983 :  and then you have a third party saying vote for us well establish a theocracy

22984 :  theyre transnational and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders

22985 :  if i asked you to think of the ideas of al qaeda thats something that comes to your mind immediately

22986 :  lets bring the military back again

22987 :  and then people say weve tried democracy

22988 :  so the ideas and the narratives of al qaeda come to your mind immediately

22989 :  but actually its my belief that the people whove been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior up until now up until

22990 :  we need to move one step beyond that now

22991 :  but generally the trends that start in egypt have historically spread across the mena region the middle east and north africa region

22992 :  and its with that thought that ill end

22993 :  it doesnt really work

22994 :  many more people would be much better off if they didnt use this technology

22995 :  it short circuits the brain and were starting to find it has actual cognitive consequences one of them being this sort of pervasive

22996 :  it sounds old fashioned but they were onto something back then

22997 :  were not wired from it

22998 :  by definition the market is not going to give a lot of value to those behaviors

22999 :  so life without social media is really not so bad

23000 :  you dont have the constant hum of stimuli and the background hum of anxiety that comes along with that

23001 :  its one thing to spend a couple of hours at a slot machine in las vegas but if you bring one with you and you pull that handle all day long

23002 :  i just ask that you direct your comments towards twitter

23003 :  so i never signed up

23004 :  call it impossibly idealistic if you must

23005 :  but maybe there are other things we should be thinking about

23006 :  the atmosphere of mars today is too thin and too cold for water to be stable as a liquid

23007 :  how do atmospheres get their energy for escape

23008 :  this cant happen on mars today

23009 :  weve looked other places maybe not as hard as we should or we could but weve looked and havent found any earth is the only

23010 :  this has to play into habitability

23011 :  and of course distance of a planet from the sun determines its temperature

23012 :  and many solar system bodies dont have liquid water and so we dont look there

23013 :  atmosphere hasnt been able to escape

23014 :  seven million species

23015 :  we have the observations of those planets but we just dont know which ones are habitable yet

23016 :  my fourth observation has to do with methodology

23017 :  spaces being places they could occupy

23018 :  ive got an idea

23019 :  but frankly thats just half the story

23020 :  for example they took clay and fire and made ceramics and pottery

23021 :  but it is this third category that is most intriguing to us those of us again who are designers

23022 :  i do know that prostitution is all about trading sex for things of value

23023 :  and these people were as well

23024 :  so when we think about the very first humans very first humans on this earth for them things

23025 :  they were sticks and stones and bones and antlers and minerals and for

23026 :  and then something interesting happened

23027 :  chances are your experience of the meat dramatically changed

23028 :  for much of my life i never wondered about my choice to eat certain animals because i never even knew i had a choice

23029 :  and she replies the secret is in the meat

23030 :  so i cared about fritz and im not unique

23031 :  eating animals was just a given

23032 :  no one had ever asked me if i believed in eating animals

23033 :  hints of the truth surround us

23034 :  i know it can be painful to see that

23035 :  most of us care about animals

23036 :  in a moment im going to show a two minute video of animal factories which can be difficult

23037 :  i identified and codified this factor and im here to share my findings with you

23038 :  so i want to remind you that my intention is simply to raise awareness

23039 :  i thought they were fun

23040 :  but finding the good stories the good shows is harder and harder and harder

23041 :  and how do you think does that change the storytelling process at all

23042 :  because if you have one tiny show over here on amc and one tiny show over here over there finding where they are

23043 :  its a little more like theater and im not sure it would work but im fascinating by the concept of something like that and what that would mean

23044 :  i walked in and i was like that scene where our mystery woman starts speaking russian

23045 :  you know if im in charge of how the sopranos ends then thats lovely and i have an ending thats nice and satisfying but its not the same

23046 :  so i think the interesting thing that happens is that when you look at the world

23047 :  i want to see what they look like if they read

23048 :  im not sure if were going to be able to do them in time

23049 :  we have some interesting ideas for that

23050 :  and instead of having a scene where you know hes talking to another character very rapidly he goes into a

23051 :  imagine sitting next to him or being with a character like huck whos about to execute somebody

23052 :  well see what happens

23053 :  i mean i didnt even imagine television

23054 :  but the idea that we would live tweet our show was really just us thinking that would be fun

23055 :  its getting a little bit disturbing

23056 :  i think of story in terms of character and what characters would do and what characters need to do in order to make them move

23057 :  i mean i grew up wanting to be toni morrison so no

23058 :  i find it fascinating that you cant really binge watch you cant fast forward

23059 :  for storytelling other than books

23060 :  were in this sort of wild west period to me it feels like because nobody knows what were going to settle on

23061 :  i do think that there are going to be different ways but i dont know

23062 :  and that was always great except now it felt like the wheels were coming off the bus and things were actually

23063 :  you say hello

23064 :  if you are a stiff vessel the magic the emotion will not come out

23065 :  and i was like

23066 :  and some of the implications are quite amazing

23067 :  i went on to further my education

23068 :  to be able to walk with my class and to graduate on time

23069 :  i am my teachers first male student in a tradition understood by many as female and i

23070 :  but this is four thirds

23071 :  we find patterns and we represent them

23072 :  i truly believe this

23073 :  and i want to focus on mathematics

23074 :  i want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is

23075 :  lets play around with the earth

23076 :  so that is my claim

23077 :  ok so why am i doing all this

23078 :  my claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change your perspective

23079 :  i didnt like it at all

23080 :  my name is vaishali

23081 :  how had my world turned from day to night and what had happened to my family

23082 :  she brought me in and she sat me down on a bucket where she tried to sponge bathe me and change me out of

23083 :  they are so lucky

23084 :  finally after i dont know fifteen minutes probably of begging and crying she

23085 :  hes going to rape me and then hes going to kill me because nobody survives being kidnapped

23086 :  i know that when we are faced with trials we have a choice

23087 :  finally some part of me pulled myself together long enough to hear him say the words that i

23088 :  the best punishment you could ever give him is to be happy is to move forward with your life

23089 :  there was a tent set up

23090 :  i mean i remember being brought so far up into the mountains

23091 :  i am grateful that i can make a difference

23092 :  how had just yesterday i had been at school with my friends how had just yesterday id been at

23093 :  i will never forget feeling that no matter what lay in front of me it was going to be

23094 :  i remember sitting there and crying and crying and thinking of what had happened to

23095 :  the only thoughts that i could think of were going to happen to me were

23096 :  what was going to happen to me

23097 :  so i have to encourage every single one of you

23098 :  we crossed right over the top of the mountain and started down the other side

23099 :  he pulled me off the bucket where id been sitting onto the ground where he ripped off the robe id been forced to

23100 :  had this man gone through my house already and murdered my family

23101 :  but we all have a choice to make

23102 :  i remember this strange man taking me way up into the mountains behind my home all the while at knife

23103 :  i wish i could be one of those children because no one will ever hurt them again

23104 :  youll never know the lives youll be able to touch

23105 :  i will never forget

23106 :  and so here this man was telling me that i was supposed to consummate our marriage and i may have grown up

23107 :  i will never forget the first time i saw my dad after the police had stopped and picked me up

23108 :  i remember begging and pleading and crying and tried to come up with every

23109 :  they are the lucky ones

23110 :  there are days when we wish we could pull the covers back up and hibernate

23111 :  it is so important

23112 :  no one can never do that to them again

23113 :  we can give in and surrender or we can fight and we can move forward

23114 :  its thick atmosphere not its distance from the sun is the reason

23115 :  so who are we

23116 :  and almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies

23117 :  so we can keep this growth based economy going

23118 :  is this really how economies behave

23119 :  but the materiality matters too because in every society that

23120 :  but actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me

23121 :  goodness knows what they make of the lake district weather

23122 :  it has to be civil society

23123 :  youre not making news out of things falling down

23124 :  is this really how people are

23125 :  what weve done is weve created economies

23126 :  we cant live with it we cant live without it

23127 :  and my then five year old daughter was helping me in the way that five year olds do

23128 :  the worst interview i ever did william l

23129 :  i never claimed that

23130 :  im going to talk about a program i started there which from my point of view is the proudest thing i did

23131 :  the usual sort of thing

23132 :  they have their place

23133 :  this was not a devastating stroke but it did affect his speaking and so forth

23134 :  all of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited

23135 :  so how do we do that

23136 :  it was about their energy

23137 :  and she said do you know what that is

23138 :  and i was dying

23139 :  by the way this was always done in public

23140 :  and so i came up with the idea of the living self portrait series

23141 :  i said did jefferson ever disappoint you

23142 :  and thats what its about

23143 :  an amazing woman

23144 :  first of all was that dance even though it hadnt been offered to her was her life

23145 :  they have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you

23146 :  were trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future

23147 :  we must cease telling people that they have to act a certain way that they have to behave a certain way

23148 :  my parents risked their lives to come to this country in hopes of a better one not knowing whether or not

23149 :  but my dad apologized explained the situation and strategized the best plan to start production

23150 :  my dad was working twenty hours a day seven days a week and my mom was working full time

23151 :  and r amp b enterprises was very profitable at the time so the son refused

23152 :  i really believe that everyone has something to learn from the b boy process this breakin mentality

23153 :  we saw each other every day

23154 :  im from hueytown alabama

23155 :  or in the words of f

23156 :  in a war two allies are playing a non zero sum game

23157 :  and its good to treat other people well

23158 :  thats a non zero sum game

23159 :  so we need to be aware of what kind of signals were sending out

23160 :  so if you want to take a particularly hard case for an american somebody in iran who is

23161 :  so they do understand that if you want to be treated well you treat other

23162 :  the bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family

23163 :  you both feel youve won

23164 :  and in real life there are lots of non zero sum games

23165 :  this isnt only about religion

23166 :  good things happen and its good for much of the world

23167 :  so theres still work to be done

23168 :  its why social organization has grown from the hunter gatherer village to the ancient state the empire and now

23169 :  thats a zero sum game

23170 :  it happened through a principle known as kin selection

23171 :  and the story of globalization is largely a story of non zero sumness

23172 :  ill tell you why

23173 :  simply by making a moment

23174 :  but heres how you can do it too

23175 :  i turn to that corner of the arena and i thrust my fist in the air in victory

23176 :  if we took all the energy we spent on waging war and put it into solving our disputes instead of making more then maybe we could fix the problems

23177 :  but know that revenge is against yourself

23178 :  we as individuals all have unique assets that make us valuable in this world

23179 :  every single day that i reach out and talk to people from anywhere in the world i know that im learning new

23180 :  so by looking at what the users are demanding of each platform what vine users dislike about

23181 :  an excellent example of this is crowdfunding

23182 :  so youre a mac or youre a pc right

23183 :  so before the internet neighborhoods would gather at barbecues or a porch

23184 :  their treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls

23185 :  we did our best to find reasons to laugh

23186 :  we spoke through these handsets attached to the wall and talked about books and movies

23187 :  and i was approved

23188 :  and i think thats a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have that allows these types of things to happen

23189 :  how could this possibly be happening

23190 :  and they said that if i attempted to interview mcgowan the visit would be terminated

23191 :  like other cmu prisoners mcgowan repeatedly asked for an answer a hearing or some

23192 :  as daunting as it may be its about doing something because you know youve never done it before

23193 :  though i eventually came to the realization that i needed to raise this company on my own

23194 :  plants for example are able to memorize

23195 :  ninetynine mixture of co2 to methane or better and

23196 :  were going to do this by increasing the length of our membranes and adding in multiple channels

23197 :  fifty mixture of co2 to methane into a one
23198 :  sapo thirtyfour is very stable

23199 :  it can function under a wide range of pressures and it can take temperatures up to seven hundred
23200 :  it has half the co2 emissions and it doesnt come with the toxic byproducts that are found in coal

23201 :  hard problems are hard

23202 :  it is not one thousand nine hundred and sixtyone
23203 :  there is no galvanizing contest like the cold war no politician like john

23204 :  theyve expanded and enriched our lives

23205 :  coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind and petroleum is cheaper than

23206 :  for most of human history we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail

23207 :  and so we never actually saw anybodys password

23208 :  now entropy is a complicated term but basically it measures the strength of passwords

23209 :  this is what a slaughterhouse worker says i dont think of farmed animals as

23210 :  another reason has to do with a coping process that psychologists call psychic numbing

23211 :  but dont just take my word for it

23212 :  but im not going to show you any graphic images or

23213 :  there are so many reasons

23214 :  well we compete in memory

23215 :  im a memory athlete

23216 :  i mean youve never been inside a snail cell

23217 :  thats one of the events to memorize words

23218 :  what if i told you that that is all the knowledge you need to fundamentally understand how your memory

23219 :  what do you mean

23220 :  i think its easy if i show you

23221 :  it has a door on it

23222 :  something completely different from what i know now

23223 :  and what comes after hearts of ten
23224 :  i know he doesnt do anything different from what we just did before

23225 :  before that i knew nothing

23226 :  this one i will remember

23227 :  if you speak english spanish and portuguese

23228 :  some neuroscientists have been using transcranial stimulation which is passing

23229 :  can you imagine if we did that about technology

23230 :  it was called humanity plus

23231 :  i think its one of the most critical innovations that human beings have made

23232 :  the two groups that did exercise whether they wanted to or not got the benefits of oxygen in their brain

23233 :  so we dont actually know whether we discovered how to make fire and then we could eat

23234 :  one group kept in a confined space one group were forced to run on a treadmill for a certain

23235 :  and as a virtue its a set of strengths focused on caring for others

23236 :  and brain scanning shows that at the end of that period of learning the part of the brain that has to do with

23237 :  and then my logical brain kicked in and i needed to know

23238 :  theyve also had a longstanding movement around gender neutral clothing and gender neutral toys for

23239 :  basically events of the beginning of last year went into fast forward by the spring of last year snowden was ready to do this leak

23240 :  they went upstairs and they began talking

23241 :  and snowden came up with a suggestion which was and i kid you not lg

23242 :  but he is also a brilliant reporter

23243 :  in other words theres a complete record of where youve been

23244 :  i think we should thank edward snowden

23245 :  they met with snowden at the mira hotel initially glenn and laura

23246 :  and the three of them flew to hong kong

23247 :  he didnt really do anything about it

23248 :  really it was kind of a badly written kgb drama

23249 :  it wasnt that funny when i was standing there trust me

23250 :  so im going to make us hyper aware

23251 :  but what makes something unmemorable

23252 :  but what does that do

23253 :  once again the language defines how we think about hiv

23254 :  i was terrified

23255 :  and i dont think thats fair

23256 :  i will not get hiv

23257 :  can i tell my parents

23258 :  but no each and every one of us contributes to this overall story and how we talk about hiv and how we react

23259 :  and thats why we might be used to saying things like those people who have hiv as if somehow

23260 :  it could mean that we would have to find out

23261 :  oh im not promiscuous i dont need to use a condom

23262 :  ive been doing outreach at ubc for about six months now and i get asked some common questions here by ubc

23263 :  and no hiv is absolutely not just a gay problem

23264 :  its really important to identify them and to move past them because no you cannot get hiv from a toilet seat

23265 :  because we should break past this stigma behind testing and we should just go and do it

23266 :  and i dont believe in this othering

23267 :  and steve is hiv positive

23268 :  i dont need to get tested

23269 :  but no hiv affects people we know

23270 :  at that one moment i didnt know what to think

23271 :  but im going to argue that while hiv is life changing it is not life defining

23272 :  am i going to die

23273 :  it could mean that we would have to think about hiv and how it affects us

23274 :  i have a friend

23275 :  and steve said

23276 :  everythings going to be ok

23277 :  its as simple as that

23278 :  four million people are hiv positive

23279 :  and thats an important difference

23280 :  in it we see superman rushing out grabbing a car thats full of

23281 :  in one highly viewed episode a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet

23282 :  but rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements i just want to share with you four

23283 :  in fact if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the 20th

23284 :  on rare occasions a high school kid does it

23285 :  so if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic

23286 :  biomechanical analysis of the speed of owens joints shows that had been running on the same surface as bolt

23287 :  an american sprinter jumps out to the front

23288 :  and this showed in athletes bodies

23289 :  and that guy who won the one thousand nine hundred and four olympic marathon in three in a half hours that guy was drinking rat poison and

23290 :  our primate cousins cant do that

23291 :  but normally we cant access nearly all of it

23292 :  rather than blocks jesse owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from

23293 :  whats happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once and theyre throwing

23294 :  the gun goes off

23295 :  imagine lady liberty the blindfolded woman holding the scale meant to symbolize the balance in

23296 :  the closer you measure the longer it is

23297 :  he invited them to bring their gifts

23298 :  or indeed to help an entire community

23299 :  rosabeth moss kanter the harvard academic puts it beautifully when she says that when

23300 :  robin is not a client in a service

23301 :  i believe that the solution to the most intractable problems that we face

23302 :  the only way that we can address loneliness is by building community by building deep

23303 :  people telling us that these are the assets that must be identified connected and

23304 :  most people when they see litter what they do is one of two things typically

23305 :  so often when we label people as vulnerable or as deficient or as problematic

23306 :  that was his great passion taking branches from fallen trees and carving them into walking sticks

23307 :  they are in a school that looks as much like an economic hub as it does a school it s a school that is focused

23308 :  is a question that millions of people ask millions of other people every single day

23309 :  and what robin said when she asked those questions was he was passionate about making walking sticks

23310 :  we can begin to actually reflect on a form of helping which starts with a focus on whats strong

23311 :  the two issues that they took on the first was the fact that there were street children in each of their villages

23312 :  youll probably recognize yourself in more than one

23313 :  id like to offer a radical theory of change based on my experience working around the world with people trying to solve our

23314 :  and yet as magicians we use the term to fool when it comes to a magic trick that successfully works right

23315 :  and maybe her grandson has a propensity for quantum mechanics or an interest in hugh everetts multiple world

23316 :  we need these for survival and sanity

23317 :  but im nice about it i tell you im going to lie then i do

23318 :  so why do we as adults respond this way to magic

23319 :  you know that you have object permanence

23320 :  theyre also not afraid of being wrong and not knowing how something works right away

23321 :  actually its the opposite

23322 :  i really wish my grandson were here to see you perform

23323 :  ill illustrate that with another comment we get a lot and that is boy i bet its really easy to fool a drunk person

23324 :  were down to one

23325 :  but imagine the first coin

23326 :  if the large portion of the world sees magic for the first time on tv and says this is for kids those kids might grow up

23327 :  come on i lie for a living its my job

23328 :  first off that people think that the more they know the harder they are to fool

23329 :  this is what happens

23330 :  it wasnt that it wasnt for kids it just wasnt exclusively for kids

23331 :  and that is i think a good magic trick instills or can instill a sense of childlike wonder

23332 :  so of course theyre going to be more amused more amazed and its ok for the kid to like magic tricks

23333 :  and that was pretty loud

23334 :  ill do it visually

23335 :  everyones saying up the sleeve

23336 :  if i put my hand over the coin and id ask you can you see the coin

23337 :  jerry andrus said this beautifully

23338 :  the more you think you know the easier it is for me as a magician to fool you

23339 :  theyre not necessarily able to see whats right in front of them

23340 :  you want to see how this works

23341 :  its misdirection everyones watching the coin

23342 :  curiosity is the catalyst for progress

23343 :  they know whats in front of them theyll focus here

23344 :  we look to someone that societally is acceptable to fool a child

23345 :  to a person who still believes in santa claus or the tooth fairy a well executed card trick might not be quite as

23346 :  its like a zen thing for cards

23347 :  the tricksters an important character

23348 :  if you think about commonplace technology like a helicopter or a submarine things we all know right now they might not have been

23349 :  cards prefer to be in this orderly state of tranquility

23350 :  when the cards are in order my thoughts are in order

23351 :  thats the assumption im going to work under and try to use that against your own assumption

23352 :  its important to know that she is not by any means a ventriloquist

23353 :  he had three rules of predictions

23354 :  well a child doesnt have as much life experience as i do

23355 :  i shouldnt be showing you this but

23356 :  youd obviously say no

23357 :  as for me as a magician im not out here trying to be this whimsical silly little magician trying to get you to believe

23358 :  what well do is use your imagination

23359 :  imagine what it would look like for all three coins to disappear

23360 :  first i ask if you really need that because many needs are created

23361 :  why do i insist

23362 :  i had done my financial analysis so long ago that i used lotus one two
23363 :  we have fewer spousal or partner job relocations

23364 :  were in a more settled time of life

23365 :  but in the meantime if you are returning to work after a career break dont

23366 :  because the internship allows the employer to base their hiring decision on an actual

23367 :  we did that already

23368 :  ill tell you what happened with tracy in a little bit but i want to share with you a discovery that i made when i was

23369 :  were not trying to find ourselves at an employers expense

23370 :  we have a more mature perspective

23371 :  so even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full time role she decided to

23372 :  in fact an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their

23373 :  and thats even if your sense of self has diminished over time as happens with so many of us the

23374 :  and they do

23375 :  i met tracy in june of two thousand and eleven when the today show asked me if

23376 :  think about how far we have come

23377 :  and one of those gaps that ive seen is around this concept and the concept is a really simple one

23378 :  even though theres a couple different ways that stars form one of the most robust is this process

23379 :  and its worth thinking that maybe the meaning of our lives are actually not even within the scope of our understanding

23380 :  and this is actually really a central part of the hemoglobin molecule because this is the thing that allows us to bind

23381 :  but whenever i hear people talk and mention this phrase that we are all connected they do so in

23382 :  and it was a very slow process

23383 :  because why in the world would galaxies collide

23384 :  like the world i came to is exactly the same as the world that i left

23385 :  i mean i had no purpose in this life

23386 :  and today im here to describe that everything really is connected and not in some abstract

23387 :  each one of these ways of being these things that we put out into the world through the creative process of mixing

23388 :  well actually they never really left us

23389 :  it was a color in the palette of being that you couldnt paint with

23390 :  its an element of almost every spiritual tradition of humankind throughout all of history

23391 :  it might come from a piece of artwork that you create

23392 :  a self driving car

23393 :  it might come from the way that you express yourself as a human being

23394 :  it says that the way that we are in our lives the way that we affect our friends and our family begin to

23395 :  and theyre now called chloroplasts

23396 :  and this is true for employee employer relationship as well

23397 :  where would you go

23398 :  i think everyone in this room was a child at some point

23399 :  because if it sends an image to the earth it takes about twelve minutes on

23400 :  where you have to compare the benefits and costs of different cities now you have to compare the reputations of

23401 :  so it would be too late

23402 :  how well do we make decisions

23403 :  and they cant necessarily go out and search for that answer and understand what they find

23404 :  we have jobs we have school we have homework

23405 :  why am i going to ask a question about this random thing when i have stats homework to do

23406 :  and its not a shameful thing not to know something

23407 :  to find the baby jesus the magi followed a star

23408 :  and i find this really sad because when a child asks a question they cant necessarily understand the answer

23409 :  i dont have time to think about it or ask questions

23410 :  that has nothing to do with space

23411 :  they were in the center of stars that made this universe

23412 :  and it became more mature

23413 :  because we right now can only reach for the stars but maybe one day they will be able to

23414 :  but guess what

23415 :  please stop sending in those pictures of dogs its not about this

23416 :  so i went to the art academy in latvia and asked an artist

23417 :  they are all sitting there

23418 :  she grew up in nazi germany in the 30s and the 40s

23419 :  we used landmarks to approximate their physical addresses

23420 :  some did better than others

23421 :  how smart do you want to be

23422 :  empires rose and fell

23423 :  you must be wondering all right so what are you up to now

23424 :  he said yeah

23425 :  i knew that san francisco was the tech capital of the world hosting many of the

23426 :  so i did a street casting and i approached a few homeless people

23427 :  whered you go

23428 :  we arent copying celebrities lives

23429 :  we arent perfecting our lives

23430 :  so that was sort of the beginning of the end of my pity party

23431 :  my mom had died of cancer at fortyone
23432 :  when i recovered a little while later i was still minus the body parts but

23433 :  laughter is so healing

23434 :  mine was shaped by my dad

23435 :  just like reaching out to the sunflower by providing someone who is neglected isolated or forgotten

23436 :  they are incredible yet so often they are forgotten lacking the love and appreciation they deserve

23437 :  one day a young boy comes upon the sunflower while visiting the garden and he notices how weak it looks

23438 :  because whenever i found a gap in services i tried to help

23439 :  our programmers remember only women including gay and

23440 :  i was five years old clutching the hand of my nine year old sister and had very little idea as to

23441 :  we disguised the domestic and part time nature of the staff by offering fixed

23442 :  theyre sharing sound

23443 :  all right i know that the internet and telephone technology probably have us more connected than we ever have

23444 :  and so does the technology

23445 :  but you know technology

23446 :  we could get it anywhere anytime

23447 :  alone or apart

23448 :  and its also an ancient question

23449 :  but it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise

23450 :  how hard a process is that

23451 :  and participating in the nurturing of the planet

23452 :  how do we duplicate that if we have a system of private land ownership and all that

23453 :  sharpen your quill

23454 :  and when the girls started engaging him he was very hostile towards them

23455 :  when i asked who is that

23456 :  and all day she walked around only in her underwear

23457 :  what if we could find a solution between funding and defunding an organization that helps womens health

23458 :  that would cost too much money

23459 :  i think they let me in by accident

23460 :  but what are you going to do with all these ideas

23461 :  will it improve the world

23462 :  dont cross the line

23463 :  i got to work on the first consumer facing digital camera and now we can capture all the smiles

23464 :  the engineering taught me how to build products and how hard it is to build products

23465 :  so we were working with a manufacturer probably the one you had in your home because they knew people didnt know how to

23466 :  the rest was up to him

23467 :  stand in line

23468 :  and youll do it

23469 :  build it anyway

23470 :  will it change the way people interact

23471 :  i said dada read this

23472 :  some of you understand the technique i can ask what if

23473 :  we call this funnel vision and it gets you to that set that you can start working from

23474 :  im talking about getting from cant to can to come up with the ideas in the first place so you dont feel

23475 :  people would never use that

23476 :  well force them to do it

23477 :  the information was inside my house and it was awesome

23478 :  and so we chose to look at paul rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who

23479 :  its the first time wed done this

23480 :  we could walk there

23481 :  they checked schedules

23482 :  go figure it out

23483 :  and i asked them to put their own voice over it

23484 :  they were meeting with secretaries

23485 :  they will not disappoint

23486 :  they called offices

23487 :  and that has to do as well with politeness

23488 :  how easy it is to believe that the person has moved away because youre of a different skin

23489 :  what will happen there is that the south american will be very eager and will stand at a distance thats comfortable for him

23490 :  to every single event that the very good friend will do

23491 :  and i know all of you are scratching your head a senior citizens home

23492 :  some things worked some things didnt

23493 :  but eventually i started to look human again

23494 :  and then they had to figure out well she needs furniture

23495 :  were not going to talk about the hairstyles they tried to force on me once my hair grew back

23496 :  i was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug induced coma

23497 :  i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever

23498 :  i had more than fifty surgeries

23499 :  but one of the first things they needed to do was assess what i needed right away

23500 :  somehow i ended up at the hospital

23501 :  so there were two obstacles i had to get through

23502 :  what in the world are you going to do there

23503 :  they were going to make it fun for me

23504 :  i ended up with blunt chest trauma

23505 :  but when youre blind you have the tactile memory for things

23506 :  so i moved on from there

23507 :  and as a blind person your visual memory fades and is replaced with

23508 :  so there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had

23509 :  probably the greatest single strength of the us system of higher education is the diversity of

23510 :  it wasnt easy but the change was made

23511 :  how could this possibly be

23512 :  actually in one thousand nine hundred and seventyeight when i graduated with my phd from stanford university and joined

23513 :  one of the public universities in greece is among the top forty as well

23514 :  but by two thousand and thirty three greek universities were in the worlds top forty
23515 :  but in those years of struggle and challenge some amazing things happened some fundamental changes were made

23516 :  could we engineer new ways of mourning new rituals for remembering

23517 :  but phil and i decided to reinvent project v

23518 :  in fact they welcomed me

23519 :  but that spring there were new buds popping up from the earth

23520 :  never mind the fact that i was fourteen
23521 :  i love spoken word

23522 :  so no matter that i have inhibitions to fill all my pockets i keep trying hoping that one day ill

23523 :  im always trying to find the best way to tell each story

23524 :  i discovered this bar on manhattans lower east side that hosted a weekly poetry open mic and my

23525 :  so i decided to give it a try

23526 :  as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me

23527 :  i can do this

23528 :  i will continue

23529 :  and i said charlotte it sounds pretty interesting to me

23530 :  and i always thought that my beginning was at the bowery poetry club but its possible that it was much earlier

23531 :  and that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie

23532 :  but i teach spoken word poetry because its accessible

23533 :  the only rule is dont think too hard

23534 :  when i meet you in that moment im no longer a part of your future

23535 :  i spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story and i wondered if the best way was going to be a powerpoint a short

23536 :  i will keep coming back week after week

23537 :  and step three began when i realized i didnt have to write indignant poems if thats not what i was

23538 :  after the a bomb specialists said it would take seventyfive years for the radiation damaged soil of hiroshima

23539 :  i asked her what that meant and she said miss its kind of a long story

23540 :  but in that instant i get to share your present

23541 :  impossible is trying to connect in this world trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you

23542 :  and with the help of skype that is what we are going to attempt today

23543 :  could we have people singing together in real time

23544 :  so i put it up in proctor and i left it hoping that everyone would enjoy it just as much as i did

23545 :  so she decides to form an alliance with mark antony

23546 :  no young women should be running the country

23547 :  cleopatra and mark antony reunite and at the end of the day they are both dead by their own hands

23548 :  and in order to obtain this identity she had to desexualize herself

23549 :  it makes me want to pack up my power suit and go home it makes me want to give up

23550 :  that was the way that she saw out of marriage and towards solo rule

23551 :  caesar is the head of the roman empire and they form an alliance

23552 :  he was also her brother which was normal at the time

23553 :  and since i am always a little bit nervous that people think im uptight this was the perfect poster for me

23554 :  youre maybe thinking to yourself

23555 :  this is a powerful woman an individual

23556 :  theres definitely an empowering way to do it but when all the images of powerful women from history look like this

23557 :  egypt was facing a lot of trouble during this era

23558 :  is her hair pulled back

23559 :  we do this all the time we talk about cleopatra as this hot vixen

23560 :  i do it a lot too so please forgive me but its strange because we dont call obama

23561 :  i am not alone my situation isnt unique or even special

23562 :  if anything when a woman wears a skirt and a blazer it should be a skirt suit ill grant

23563 :  this talk is about women in power so assume that when i say clinton im talking about hilary clinton

23564 :  we would never call reagan ronald

23565 :  so i hope that we can do the same for this talk

23566 :  but let me tell you

23567 :  and even today maybe last week if you wanted to dress up as cleopatra for halloween you could have

23568 :  were afraid of pushing boundaries of challenging the status quo of standing up to gender

23569 :  i tried to replicate what we had done in paihia in other towns but

23570 :  so i created the seven day makeover

23571 :  i knew they were coming for me because i was the only person for miles around

23572 :  a couple of things about my story

23573 :  its the story of how a lovely fifteen year relationship met its rapid demise when my

23574 :  but despite the tremendous amount of effort i put into supporting jaime love was not

23575 :  and when i saw that my sex life would be sacrificed for jaimes priorities that

23576 :  jaime stopped having frank conversations with me even about matters that deeply affected our lives like whether or not

23577 :  now there is work to do there are roles to play

23578 :  you want me to see you only in candlelight and to squint

23579 :  and i entered into that relationship as a heterosexual one with a man and that is how

23580 :  within eighteen short months my marriage failed spectacularly

23581 :  and he couldnt reconcile hating his body with using it for pleasure

23582 :  jaime couldnt reconcile hating his body with allowing me to love it

23583 :  you move or face the light and i see you

23584 :  and this was before jaime went on hormones

23585 :  he even took pride in growing a large hipster beard

23586 :  so we werent having sex we werent talking we werent even enjoying hobbies together

23587 :  but i was surprised to be intrigued by the contour of her lower back

23588 :  our sex life began to suffer

23589 :  he even lost interest in hobbies

23590 :  the number of americans and people across the world who are identifying as transgender has increased sharply

23591 :  he said he was happy being a man

23592 :  and it was probably the most unhappy year of my life

23593 :  for example these four algorithms were all built by the same guy

23594 :  now programming for those of you here that havent done it yourself requires laying out in

23595 :  now other cognitive or higher thinking skills that characterize this mindset are

23596 :  we use a number of filters on these things

23597 :  you pass thousands of cars to and from wherever you are going every day

23598 :  it influences how we approach challenging or problematic situations or to how we communicate to others but

23599 :  what were left with are choices that tend to be irrational and reactive in nature

23600 :  now this is what we call the thinking mindset

23601 :  i mean thats your belief

23602 :  between what brain science knows and what people do and what businesses do

23603 :  and thats if we even can make choices because a lot of the times we become indecisive we just

23604 :  if the second gatekeeper tends to tag positive or constructive meaning to that raw feeling it

23605 :  emotionally instead of understanding what our emotions are telling us we become hijacked by those same emotions we

23606 :  and what happens then

23607 :  and so very obviously we have to cooperate and we have to collaborate as nations if were going to

23608 :  and some of them do much more than answer

23609 :  ive got some wonderful people here who won the global vote

23610 :  i reckon if youre standing to become the next president of the united states youre probably pretty tied up most of the

23611 :  what is your vision for your countrys future in the world

23612 :  weve got the ex prime minister of new zealand who would be a wonderful member of the team

23613 :  we always get it wrong by the way

23614 :  when people turn inwards and turn backwards human progress becomes reversed and things get worse for everybody

23615 :  it seems to me that thats a pretty banal statement of what politicians have always done and probably should always do

23616 :  dont get me wrong

23617 :  its so obvious and yet we dont

23618 :  one hundred and forty million americans voted for the next president of the united states and yet as all of us

23619 :  i dont have a problem actually with donald trumps credo of america first

23620 :  so have i found all the ingredients to my recipe of losing weight and keeping the weight off and

23621 :  i think that in past few years i have found out about quite a few things that work for me but its the final

23622 :  no it was that audible sigh of genuine surprise that i had heard when showing the second picture that

23623 :  so our cavemen in the stone age didnt have any notice of complexity his life was

23624 :  i dont get why shes on stage shes still fat

23625 :  i showed the audience the same two pictures leaving the second one to right before the end

23626 :  and i found their theory surprisingly applicable to the process of losing weight

23627 :  you might want to stretch around a little bit

23628 :  well its what we are taught to do

23629 :  so if i dont have a reason to be afraid in a public restroom who does

23630 :  but as transgender people grow their gender identity does not turn out the way their doctor expected

23631 :  the most recent estimates of the transgender population are zero
23632 :  they had to wait line a while but eventually got in and out

23633 :  the easiest thing you can do to stop the violence in public restrooms is to be like the men in the walmart

23634 :  the way you express yours will be different than the way others express theirs

23635 :  segregation has spread fear throughout an already tense white population that if blacks were allowed to use public

23636 :  since they were both the same i chose the door on the right

23637 :  four million people

23638 :  if you had to go home every time you had to use the bathroom how far could you really go and what life

23639 :  eight percent of us trans people surveyed showed that they had kidney or urinary tract infections or other kidney related

23640 :  a customer had to intervene to stop what was happening

23641 :  women were entering the workplace for the first time and separate restrooms were societys response to a rapidly

23642 :  many transgender people do their best to avoid public restrooms entirely because of the frequent inconsistent trouble they

23643 :  it doesnt matter if youre a virgin or not

23644 :  when doctors examined their hymens they could only find clear signs of penetration

23645 :  in other words hymens naturally vary a lot in looks and that is what makes

23646 :  that could be plastic surgery known as revirgination it could be vials of blood poured

23647 :  but that makes sense right

23648 :  in norwegian it is even called the virgin membrane and with this we picture

23649 :  the myths about the hymen have lived on for centuries because they have cultural

23650 :  his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all

23651 :  perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help is to remind the

23652 :  what would the oak tree look like

23653 :  human beings were reaction machines

23654 :  what would that mean

23655 :  what is the story there

23656 :  thats the question

23657 :  were all one family

23658 :  now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story

23659 :  what do i know about puerto rico

23660 :  you retrace the footsteps of abraham

23661 :  how do we deal with our differences

23662 :  thank you very much

23663 :  they give meaning to our lives

23664 :  and so she told our team there she said you have made me visible

23665 :  the first son took his half half of eighteen is nine

23666 :  thats walking abrahams path

23667 :  were about to take a break in a moment

23668 :  thats a third side act

23669 :  the path right now is like an acorn its still in its early phase

23670 :  and thats what comes to the first step here

23671 :  how did i do it

23672 :  i dont even know if its honest

23673 :  i dont even know if its truthful

23674 :  knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom

23675 :  we are tastemakers and curators

23676 :  we are music archivists

23677 :  my parents used to give me money to eat and on most days instead of eating i would save it and buy myself a record at

23678 :  as a young man he played and toured with live bands in the us and in europe but had never recorded an album or a

23679 :  record digging is a lifestyle

23680 :  i call this groundswell collaborative consumption

23681 :  smith a would be grower

23682 :  what i find fascinating is that weve actually wired our world to share whether thats our

23683 :  it is this lack of mutual understanding that plagues these attempts

23684 :  so why are we seeing participation change

23685 :  why are we seeing engagement change forms

23686 :  and in the last canadian election the federal election not the one that took place yesterday was characterized by

23687 :  and weve all heard the insults against youth in politics that youth are dropping out of politics that were

23688 :  and theres also a failure in interpreting youth activism and engagement back

23689 :  it seems that for youth politics has become synonymous with self serving narrow

23690 :  and the good news is that those who engage in some form of alternative

23691 :  compare that though to thirtyeight less than thirtyeight of those under the

23692 :  but what i am trying to say is we need to re examine how youth and politics

23693 :  youth have the lowest voter turnout at about thirtyseven for those under the age of

23694 :  things like the h

23695 :  so we need a worldwide safety network in a way

23696 :  we might require that it shut itself down in very well specified situations

23697 :  the second criterion is that we want these systems to integrate with human society and with humans in a way that

23698 :  id like to try and give you the intuition as to why these systems might be dangerous

23699 :  based on its goal being unplugged is totally eliminating all the future games of chess that it might play so

23700 :  if we look at it going into the future if it continues at the rate that it has been going within the next few decades

23701 :  turmoil lets out the fight in me

23702 :  how would i know what the right decision was

23703 :  what was that like

23704 :  if someone describes themselves as gender queer to you you can say gender queer

23705 :  one is to ask open ended questions

23706 :  an are you with us or against us

23707 :  so she decided to get comfortable

23708 :  now some of our volunteers are religious but this particular one was not

23709 :  that sounds pretty nice

23710 :  abortion is common

23711 :  and we said why do you want to do that

23712 :  but its been a long challenge of course

23713 :  they had seen bureaucrats do that they had seen rich landlords do this

23714 :  theyve shown us that theyve managed to easily

23715 :  the higher cost of sustainable and ethical products in their budget

23716 :  i am because we are

23717 :  the third problem they had

23718 :  if we have cash we can hide it in our kitchen jars

23719 :  they had never seen poor farm workers let alone women farm workers sit in a posture of authority and it

23720 :  now no one woman could handle producing one thousand bags a week

23721 :  the first option is to stay in poverty they just stay where they are

23722 :  the first part was it was a network of rural work spaces where

23723 :  they said because our husbands wont see the bank statement lying around and he wont demand that we give him

23724 :  i was there to study rural women and what kinds of resources they used and what kinds of support they needed to escape

23725 :  they resisted they werent very happy but in time the husbands have

23726 :  youre a visionary right

23727 :  i mean youve changed the future

23728 :  this could actually improve this

23729 :  theres a lot of people who make small small changes

23730 :  i made it publicly available and it wasnt even open source at that point

23731 :  so what are the symptoms i am talking about

23732 :  i am running out trying to catch a meeting or whatever

23733 :  about ten minutes later i find the hood release

23734 :  but what about cancer what does this mean for

23735 :  previously we said lung cancer breast cancer prostate cancer

23736 :  this is the important point

23737 :  i try to figure out how they behave how they function these cancer cells

23738 :  they are a fraction of a millimeter

23739 :  we have a treatment for it

23740 :  maybe the engine is broken maybe the carburetor fell off or the steering wheel

23741 :  there is probably something wrong behind it

23742 :  so i kind of want to throw out some statistics to you that are kind of scary for me kind of frightening

23743 :  these are the symptoms we have growth and we have spread or movement

23744 :  we use microscopes to see them

23745 :  how do i know which is the ringleader

23746 :  and thats one of those things we work on is that we are trying to contribute to this as cancer

23747 :  they are small you cant see them

23748 :  these changes are known as mutations

23749 :  how do i know which is the bad cancer cell

23750 :  these guys are tiny like a fraction of a millimeter

23751 :  how do i pick what i want

23752 :  thats what we are trying to do here

23753 :  so my laboratory makes videos of cancer cells and we look at how they function these are sort

23754 :  so we can uncover the molecular mutations for everybodys cancer

23755 :  we are thinking about cancers entirely differently

23756 :  they automate the status quo

23757 :  he decided to plot them

23758 :  that begs the question what if the algorithms are wrong

23759 :  someone who stays for four years and is promoted once

23760 :  i later found out that nobody in new york city had access to that formula

23761 :  a reasonable choice would be the last twentyone years of applications to fox news

23762 :  the data what would the data be

23763 :  we talked about it

23764 :  remember with the hiring algorithm

23765 :  i was denied

23766 :  and we can fix them

23767 :  my opinion matters

23768 :  second we should think about the definition of success audit that

23769 :  i wasnt doing the interviewing my writer was and so i could keep confidentiality

23770 :  the average model in this country is five eleven and weighs one hundred and seventeen pounds

23771 :  the average woman in this country is five four and weighs one hundred and forty pounds

23772 :  most of my patients look at facebook

23773 :  its like yahtzee

23774 :  and so its lonely if you are a working mom

23775 :  both parents were very physically attractive

23776 :  there was a family in our town that i truly thought was the perfect family

23777 :  so when youre feeling badly about yourself because youre not perfect go for a walk go for a run go for a swim go for a walk with a

23778 :  one are physical strategies

23779 :  so a number of years ago i joined a bunco group

23780 :  and one of my other kids was just arrested for shoplifting

23781 :  and the problem is

23782 :  theres no such thing as a perfect person

23783 :  so were not perfect

23784 :  when i pulled on charlies arteries and veins they broke off into my hand

23785 :  the heart was surrounded by fat several inches

23786 :  within the first year we saw some unbelievably strong statistics that shows this was working

23787 :  one of the tricks our instructors taught us was you know we had to through these labs where we had to name what

23788 :  but we were finding that a great majority of our new soldiers coming off the civilian environment could not

23789 :  whats going on with the other ninetynine
23790 :  well were getting the product of that but in addition to second and third order effects were young people that were joining

23791 :  and the counter obesity measures

23792 :  so i named mine charlie

23793 :  this is not something you can put a yellow ribbon on and say let somebody else take care of it

23794 :  as they did everyone else in the class

23795 :  we estimate that we will have a forty cardiovascular disease rate by the year two thousand and thirty
23796 :  im thinking of making it a career

23797 :  you may have heard of mayor bloomberg in new york who has banned all

23798 :  if you pull on a vein its like a guitar string and itll twang

23799 :  now thats not a difficult test

23800 :  one minute of push ups one minute of sit ups and a one mile run

23801 :  the third reason we saw was an increase in technology

23802 :  now im a big fan of technology but the researchers had told me that we now watch as a nation about

23803 :  be fearless in terms of writing your schools

23804 :  thats five hours a day

23805 :  and the cadaver i had came with a medical history the professor told us in order to

23806 :  be fearless in trying to get nutrition back in restaurants

23807 :  they then sent me to be the commander of initial military training

23808 :  you couldnt just get a sixteen oz drink you could get a twentyfour fortytwo sixtyfour oz soda

23809 :  i walked into the classroom and they issued me a cadaver

23810 :  so my concern is

23811 :  there are several organizations who are attempting to approach this

23812 :  so in typical army fashion i said weve got to address these issues with our new recruits

23813 :  but the combination of a lack of physical education and an increase of poor

23814 :  this is what nfl major league baseball they know theyve got to eat right in order to perform at their maximum

23815 :  and that was

23816 :  an economic issue

23817 :  be fearless in balancing your lives and getting out to exercise

23818 :  for me this was an economic issue

23819 :  were seeing an increase in diabetes

23820 :  eventually these innovations will get out and find everyone

23821 :  is their experience changed

23822 :  and so there was a big movement to put all this information online to track all the

23823 :  technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital

23824 :  i dont know whether this is going to be successful

23825 :  we might not even end up completing it

23826 :  you dont ask for permission

23827 :  his story is really incredible

23828 :  i told his story and he loved that fact

23829 :  but even more than the art part of it just traveling with him was an experience

23830 :  i didnt know any better

23831 :  what do goats eat

23832 :  he left and we didnt see him for a couple of weeks

23833 :  we recently brought in an exhibit from the holocaust museum that was fighting the

23834 :  so i said yes with two caveats

23835 :  well today im going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans called

23836 :  and they provide jobs and medicine and food including twenty percent of

23837 :  so we start at the bottom which can be over four kilometers deep just off our continental shelf and we take

23838 :  they moderate our climate

23839 :  the line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry

23840 :  but at the same time they dont even try to understand us

23841 :  i grew up in the neighborhoods with them

23842 :  that weve got people that come in our neighborhoods and come in our schools wanting to teach because we need help

23843 :  they want to do it nine to five and leave the problem and escape to the safety of their own homes

23844 :  i know them

23845 :  they are afraid to get their hands dirty

23846 :  but if you stay in school and you work hard maybe you can come back and do something about this

23847 :  you dont want to drink a riesling with everything right

23848 :  its not easy its not like a normal white bread where you just can throw everything together

23849 :  so we are getting really incremental solutions

23850 :  because most jokes we tell are interesting because the frame switches in the middle of the joke

23851 :  and the fact is we then get very upset because the students you know they are just not so creative anymore and everyone

23852 :  so that s one of the ways you can increase your imagination

23853 :  but i m not the only one who does it

23854 :  if you can imagine it you can build it

23855 :  i wanna tell you a quick story about a friend of mine bob siegel who is a professor of here stanford who taught a

23856 :  what if the sun is

23857 :  it s up to them to turn it

23858 :  after i finished my phd i went out to study and sort of learn all about creativity in the wild working in

23859 :  but there are other ways

23860 :  and invited their students to participate at the same time

23861 :  i told them that i had sent a note ouot which i did to my colleagues around the world

23862 :  the question what if the earth is not the center of the solar system

23863 :  it s the constraints

23864 :  we have to pay people to take it away

23865 :  but imagination and knowledge are not enough

23866 :  framing and re framing problems connecting and combining ideas and challenging assumptions

23867 :  you are not going to re frame problems

23868 :  it s the rules

23869 :  i spent my entire growing up writing silence is golden

23870 :  to raise the bar even further i gave them a little bit more of a challenge

23871 :  but this is not enough

23872 :  so were talking about whats the most popular diet

23873 :  it was really too much

23874 :  i dont know why

23875 :  its just i couldnt like i couldnt process

23876 :  my name is nereida

23877 :  as like three or four different people

23878 :  that is what i am trying to say

23879 :  there is nothing wrong with a woman of size

23880 :  its like the separation of church and state

23881 :  i mean really fast

23882 :  no offense to them

23883 :  no i am teasing about that

23884 :  i will never leave

23885 :  the dunes here move southward at a pace of around six hundred meters a year

23886 :  this is a catastrophe waiting to happen again

23887 :  now as architects were trained to solve problems

23888 :  so why dont we try it now

23889 :  alright are you ready

23890 :  this is called formal meditation

23891 :  alright my friends

23892 :  so maybe its time we got this back a little

23893 :  you should have seen the looks

23894 :  so almost anywhere i went there they were

23895 :  there was one who would come as a fairy princess

23896 :  it reminded me in an odd kind of way of my nieces fifth birthday party

23897 :  and that seems fine

23898 :  where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy

23899 :  i love his orange and pink breeches

23900 :  and then i moved gradually around feeling a little lost sometimes

23901 :  and that what this object was just as much in a way in its own way as a leonardo da vinci painting is a

23902 :  it is able to move around its environment

23903 :  if you walk around the city of oxford where we are today and have a look at the brickwork which ive enjoyed doing in the last couple of

23904 :  this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living

23905 :  so im having to make them

23906 :  they think big

23907 :  but imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the

23908 :  they can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture

23909 :  im working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture and were collaborating with international scientists

23910 :  but gradually as the buildings are repaired we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the

23911 :  but they dont exist

23912 :  how did it happen

23913 :  to go out to trees to go out to forests to go out to nature to make new discoveries

23914 :  we know its a lot but we do not yet know the answers to how much and by what processes carbon

23915 :  or perhaps al gore and naturally seven could make a song about climate change that would really

23916 :  what we found however was that they took an extremely long time over twenty years to regenerate

23917 :  what are its building blocks

23918 :  suppose you want to use virchows answer to what is it

23919 :  some people thought that were made of some stuff called protoplasm whatever that is some people thought

23920 :  questions its a really good idea to do a good job answering what is it

23921 :  its a bunch of people interacting with one another

23922 :  questions as well

23923 :  and theres more

23924 :  one more point about this

23925 :  the stakes are huge in the social sciences

23926 :  question about the body wrong

23927 :  this is the workhorse of economic theory its what macro economists spend much of their time doing

23928 :  so let me start by distinguishing two kinds of questions in the sciences

23929 :  its a bunch of people interacting with one another

23930 :  imagine the lives we could save

23931 :  whats the process by which thats happening

23932 :  like imagine that you have a strand of dna and some enzymes out of which a protein is being built

23933 :  look around you right now

23934 :  lots of people are thinking about how to fix the social sciences but by large the way they

23935 :  and if we can start making improvements we just might find that after years and years and years of effort that we can

23936 :  it was too uniform

23937 :  here are the results

23938 :  how does it work

23939 :  but what is it

23940 :  virchow argued for the cell theory of organisms and here are a couple of the principles he put forward

23941 :  or look in your company

23942 :  what is a company

23943 :  we dont really do that

23944 :  these models are slightly more complicated in terms of their building blocks than the ones i just showed you but not much more

23945 :  what is money

23946 :  why do the natural sciences spend so much time addressing these questions

23947 :  questions are questions about mechanisms or processes

23948 :  whats a company

23949 :  the eye is an amazing structural and functional device and yet its not made out of cells

23950 :  and of course philosophys just one place where this needs to happen

23951 :  now this was a huge deal right

23952 :  so i started by blaming everybody

23953 :  i had been diagnosed with high blood pressure

23954 :  so that puts me in pretty illustrious company

23955 :  and he tried to persuade me to write the browser for it because his system didnt have any graphics or fonts or layout or anything it

23956 :  its something you live with

23957 :  its something you live in

23958 :  you dont beat it once and its gone forever

23959 :  some people might fear sharks

23960 :  youre wrong because its the opposite

23961 :  thats what keeps you from getting help

23962 :  some people might fear death

23963 :  thats their problem

23964 :  i think that we should be looking at the rest

23965 :  and what better way than with technology

23966 :  as the western society became the norm so did modern schooling

23967 :  progress can only be achieved through cutting corners creating shortcuts and making things more

23968 :  before this time education was based around connecting with elders and connecting with

23969 :  lets create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for

23970 :  well in california we already recycle about forty billion gallons a year of wastewater through the

23971 :  among the different choices we have its probably the most energy intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of

23972 :  well the answer is you dont want to drink it until its been treated a little bit

23973 :  and it simply grows

23974 :  and the currency im going to tell you about is carbon dioxide

23975 :  so pretty much all of us

23976 :  this is due to the lack of cerebral lateralization in the brain which is for another words language

23977 :  each time you have to sit down with your partners and say

23978 :  your first logical question is what is polyamory

23979 :  emotional literacy is the ability to understand and communicate about emotions both your own and

23980 :  we might actually get something done in politics if we can talk about things in a reasonable manner

23981 :  the more your receive the more you want to give

23982 :  its a positive feedback cycle

23983 :  that really starts within oneself

23984 :  let me start right here and say were not going to convert everybody to polyamory

23985 :  any kind of difference is more acceptable in the polyamorous community because were already so far out there

23986 :  the more you give the more you have to give

23987 :  what do we want out of our relationships

23988 :  and thats how love works

23989 :  its savory things its unexpected items its dressings its bread products its dairy products

23990 :  we need to stop eating so much processed food and sugar

23991 :  its not just candy and sweets and sodas

23992 :  none of it was manufactured

23993 :  and the most detrimental element of that unreal food that i want to talk about today is sugar

23994 :  none of it was processed

23995 :  im quite lazy so i spend three on return bus to the station every morning

23996 :  that may not sound like much but if you buy a starbucks every single weekday that costs four pounds thats

23997 :  thats a win win win win

23998 :  now is in a very encouraging debate and this is of one example of many many different

23999 :  but i realise sometimes later that there was another lesson and that lesson was that the infrastructure

24000 :  the beauty called him back

24001 :  youve got to work it

24002 :  my friend said well why dont you spend the night and you can come back tomorrow

24003 :  i felt monets spirit

24004 :  i felt the tranquility and peace

24005 :  it can be a radical act

24006 :  i was visualizing my new bloom as well

24007 :  i also felt the spirit of the place

24008 :  the dahlias and the asters towered above me

24009 :  what a beautiful world that would be

24010 :  all of these things need to change once you know that you have early signs of plaque build up

24011 :  to me thats like playing russian roulette

24012 :  and there are some hospitals that would do angiograms to just make sure its ok so many

24013 :  we need to share this because i think thats the only way that disruptive innovation

24014 :  and thats why we are doing blood tests we are doing ekgs to detect any electrical

24015 :  how do you know for which one you need to go to the emergency room and for which one you dont

24016 :  is the cholesterol too high

24017 :  is the blood sugar too high

24018 :  and more importantly we help those patients with mild or moderate diseases to recognise that

24019 :  can we offer this service to another hospital that does not have the

24020 :  you cant we arent done yet

24021 :  so you want to disrupt whatever people feel comfortable doing because thats not the right thing its

24022 :  how can you distinguish one from another

24023 :  well we ask a very simple question

24024 :  it flooded in a way thats very different than it normally does

24025 :  my name is debra brown

24026 :  im from pittsburgh pennsylvania

24027 :  im an engineer you know

24028 :  we have to make decisions and quick

24029 :  but why is it happening

24030 :  rural employment that im going to create

24031 :  its not working

24032 :  i used medical college girls

24033 :  but i am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton

24034 :  i dont want to make this as a corporate entity

24035 :  and this is the absolute highlight of this whole thing i talk about

24036 :  but completely necessary

24037 :  they were all younger than me

24038 :  it can be happy

24039 :  a cycle of encouraging others to be happy to spread that happiness because one person is all that

24040 :  its like ok it was cute in the beginning but now its not

24041 :  im going to make a change

24042 :  not one cat

24043 :  you can slip and fall

24044 :  we are the wealth us

24045 :  so when you go to a bank did you think that the bank had the money to lend you when you borrow it

24046 :  its a barter economy

24047 :  i offered the idea that

24048 :  and on this journey it was about forty hours actually and believe me nobody had a

24049 :  what are you bringing on board

24050 :  where are your talents

24051 :  thank you very much

24052 :  what have you done in the past

24053 :  what are your skills

24054 :  who i really am

24055 :  how do you want to spend your time

24056 :  that tells you something really important

24057 :  the financial crisis is really a relatively small historic phenomenon which has just accelerated

24058 :  i once asked one of my colleagues at harvard hey is south america part of the west

24059 :  where did you find that orchid and how do i get there

24060 :  how do you spell that

24061 :  this is very important though

24062 :  for all these decades ive been trying to look for more sensible answers and to give insects and the

24063 :  how do i kill this

24064 :  so we need to put eco back into economics

24065 :  arent you lucky you werent raised in an ants nest

24066 :  i migrated indeed i did

24067 :  how do i eradicate ants from my garden

24068 :  where did you get the pollen on your back

24069 :  some pollinators are very liberal in what they pollinate others are very specific ill give you an example

24070 :  and thats a real shame because these guys have got protein that contains virtually no cholesterol is very high

24071 :  we dont mind invertebrates from the sea we call those

24072 :  but eradicate is a big word

24073 :  that way we allow to become a little bit of an almost one hundred clean and green country by growing our food at least

24074 :  theres stuff going on on this planet of ours that we have no idea about

24075 :  who eats that

24076 :  i said excuse me

24077 :  there are all sorts of figures and theyre impressive figures

24078 :  until hes got about twelve up there

24079 :  god invented carpet beetles well before she invented carpets

24080 :  the harlequin beetle from venezuela has its own species of pseudoscorpion and its actually more kinkier

24081 :  thats where im leaving that

24082 :  and people say

24083 :  robert costanza in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven
24084 :  walt disney was fired from his first job at a newspaper because he lacked imagination

24085 :  turn off the internet

24086 :  we naturally have that

24087 :  some give it energy others transport things back and forth kind of like a metro system or a railroad

24088 :  so he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds

24089 :  but then finally one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea

24090 :  so it had been a huge gamble but it had paid off

24091 :  and truly to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding

24092 :  well you should care because theyre an indicator species

24093 :  what could one person possibly do to make a difference

24094 :  what did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw so many oiled

24095 :  in addition i believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life

24096 :  and as a result during the treasure rescue just one hundred and sixty penguins died

24097 :  and when we come together and work as one we can achieve extraordinary

24098 :  just look at that seventeen year old

24099 :  and i wanted to do something to help but i always wondered

24100 :  well she could not be more wrong

24101 :  and simply put

24102 :  and with that call my life would change forever

24103 :  so if we each do our part together we can make a difference and we can help keep penguins

24104 :  if penguins are dying it means our oceans are dying

24105 :  and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming

24106 :  this is critically important because one year ago the african penguin was

24107 :  so one second for one second of computing

24108 :  we have grown from that first small gay pool party of twelve and

24109 :  the importance of the confidentiality and secrecy in our group ensures that those safe and open spaces are

24110 :  starting humbly from that lovely queer pool party five years ago weve expanded to regular events

24111 :  ladies and gentlemen thank you very much indeed

24112 :  twelve young gay and lesbian kids came together for a day of summertime fun

24113 :  we are i can happily tell you the only peer led lgbt youth organization of its kind in the country

24114 :  more contemporaneously we might think of the sprawling suburbia where thousands of houses

24115 :  we also provide those meaningful links and connections to community resources and

24116 :  it is a link it is bringing together those many islands

24117 :  not only are we able to use the internet as a medium of exchange it is a facilitator a

24118 :  our first event i can recall old photos of our first social event back in june two thousand and ten it was a pool party

24119 :  the qnyn is divided into three subgroups

24120 :  the alphabet soup of l g b t q q i a has

24121 :  and we are very happy to be part of the ted family

24122 :  ive been there

24123 :  we had foreign terrorist fighters tweeting in their own languages

24124 :  but we also saw a dangerous trend violent extremists know the rules and regulations of social

24125 :  so we have to look at the pull factors

24126 :  they talked very little about politics

24127 :  so all of a sudden we couldnt track where that conversation went

24128 :  and you become what is good challenging what is evil

24129 :  if you want to talk im here

24130 :  they must have something wrong with their upbringing

24131 :  how do we provide alternatives for that

24132 :  its a story about the collapse of the planet

24133 :  what you cannot see under the water are the values and beliefs that drive

24134 :  for women they used the story of emancipation and sexiness

24135 :  you must imagine a habit like an iceberg

24136 :  so we frame it as a problem of production

24137 :  its an apocalyptic future

24138 :  as a journalist your readers

24139 :  this story is not strong enough to break the power of the immediate happiness that i can get

24140 :  what is it that explains this gap between intentions and behavior

24141 :  we dont believe them

24142 :  we are very good in shifting the blame somewhere else and rationalising our own unsustainable

24143 :  so these stories are not credible

24144 :  it tends to be against the company

24145 :  so that made me think but why

24146 :  so they do it because they like it

24147 :  and various people came up to me and said you have to be careful about this new guy this new boss youre getting

24148 :  so theyre doing it quite often to create confusion and chaos all around them

24149 :  and so they go into the corporate world

24150 :  then you think that these people must have been wrong

24151 :  he looks like your next best friend

24152 :  and therefore the only person that seems like they want

24153 :  so it all gets swept under the carpet

24154 :  and quite often theyll do things like theyll pay off the people who are being bullied

24155 :  well corporate psychopaths are those psychopaths who are about one of the

24156 :  and so you get confused

24157 :  psychopaths bully for two main reasons

24158 :  and when i was moved offices i was told i was getting a new boss

24159 :  so the same words are used to describe them these psychopaths as i used to describe

24160 :  you expect to meet a monster

24161 :  thats one of the reasons they do it

24162 :  and if there are psychopaths there will be bullying

24163 :  and when people say things like that to you thats what you expect

24164 :  so if you link it at an organizational level companies like enron

24165 :  they can be totally ruthless and sleep perfectly well that night because nothing they do

24166 :  one of them is predatory

24167 :  so youll stop working properly youll sabotage normal work processes youll

24168 :  it was three hundred and fortysix managers research carried out in two thousand and eight
24169 :  the other reason they do it is what ive called instrumental bullying

24170 :  so anybody for example a boss looking down on this whole situation of bullying and emotional

24171 :  how about the mid 2020s

24172 :  we have renewable energy sources we can recycle we can decrease our population growth we can even get rid of our

24173 :  that happened to be my day job

24174 :  we dont need those resources that we have plenty of them here

24175 :  lets do it right this time

24176 :  not with trucks across mountains but with rockets to our civilization in space to refuel

24177 :  not only that

24178 :  it is also not an economical proposition

24179 :  the people who lived there really hated it

24180 :  a life outside of maximum custody

24181 :  when i asked him about that moment he said he was trying to remember the last time that somebody had extended their hand to him in

24182 :  ive overheard officers in maximum custody describe their roles as room service

24183 :  inmates who had once repeatedly violated the rules slowly start to demonstrate the skills taught through

24184 :  officers the staff that have always spent the most time with inmates are

24185 :  all of my interactions took place with either a steel door or a thick visitation room window between

24186 :  i didnt have a lot of time to be doing a lot of the promotions that i wanted to be doing

24187 :  shortly after that my grandfather died of prostate cancer and within about six months

24188 :  im a big sports fan and i got to do the halftime shows at some football games and my local ice hockey game

24189 :  im not interested in them

24190 :  its too hard

24191 :  and they can even predict a potential failure before it even happens so that we can go and fix it

24192 :  we put in rainwater harvesting systems

24193 :  for example if many of the solar panels are not collecting a lot of energy it might

24194 :  but are we ready to be smart

24195 :  and do you know that it can even do this

24196 :  so with an ageing population such smart solutions are actually very useful

24197 :  how much sun actually falls on the surfaces of the town and on the buildings

24198 :  everybody talks about being smart

24199 :  and thats what we do to all traffic survivors

24200 :  well how do we make sure that people like you and me who want to be mentors get really great matches

24201 :  and when i think back on all of the skills and the knowledge that ive gained from mentors the greatest gift i

24202 :  and so the big question that i asked myself back in december of two thousand and twelve is

24203 :  but they are expensive and there is a shortage of doctors

24204 :  create unexpected alliances

24205 :  the story of mother to baby transmission converted religious conservatives from being

24206 :  so let me ground that in a few practical examples

24207 :  and its not just america

24208 :  so for example i am working on a future movement with a goal of ending avoidable

24209 :  21st century movements are built through mass participation through people discovering a sense of their own

24210 :  back in the 20th century it was different science captured the public

24211 :  whats wrong in our world

24212 :  science budgets are being slashed

24213 :  please tell me what have i done

24214 :  and now you could see them

24215 :  and as well like scheherazade they were well educated woman

24216 :  please sister allow me to see your face one last time

24217 :  and the boy raised his hand and he said mr

24218 :  i have learnt so much from her

24219 :  how can discipline be possible without any consequences

24220 :  always a smile

24221 :  with the foundation she has created for herself its up to her to keep that foundation strong by

24222 :  at the age of twelve she quit school

24223 :  education was important to her

24224 :  rehabilitation is what you need to change

24225 :  she is productive and she gives back everyday

24226 :  she lives by that everyday

24227 :  we became friends that day and weve been friends from that day till now

24228 :  shes made a difference in peoples lives including mine

24229 :  it was one of the hardest things to do trying to be a mother and watch them grow up without her

24230 :  when she saw me sitting there by myself nineteen years ago she came up and talked to me

24231 :  we are now a registered charity in the us were talking to foundations we couldnt have possibly got hold off before

24232 :  whats going to work best for your communities

24233 :  we stopped doing certain things telling our community partners how to spend the money we gave

24234 :  so anything that we collect in two thousand and sixteen were bringing directly to our partnerships in the rainforest

24235 :  we have disney now funding some fantastic biodiversity work

24236 :  we always tried to avoid it but we really stepped back and said look this is your cash its your rainforest

24237 :  things that you do because other charities do them

24238 :  and that aridity can also have an impact

24239 :  they cant reproduce in the wild anymore

24240 :  one is that they are regionally variable

24241 :  now unfortunately in american diets today the trend is going in the opposite direction

24242 :  we see evidence of harvesting of bone marrow in faunal assembles where you see characteristic cutting open of the bones like you

24243 :  we need more surface area we need more microbes

24244 :  the tomato thats shown here lacks the tomatine and solanine toxins that are present in its wild

24245 :  so every banana youve ever eaten is a genetic clone of every other banana grown from cuttings

24246 :  there are some general observations we can make

24247 :  its very interesting

24248 :  we do not have carnassials which are the specialised teeth that carnivores have to shred meat

24249 :  thats an awful lot of sugar

24250 :  were losing all of this balance

24251 :  we have a longer digestive tract than carnivores

24252 :  five feet of sugar cane to reach that level

24253 :  and as an example of how this thing gets so out of balance we can eat so many more

24254 :  finally the plants youd eat would still contain a lot of toxins at various levels and phytochemicals some of which

24255 :  its such a strange looking vegetable

24256 :  when we are all the same why do we hate fight and cry

24257 :  we are all born different to different fathers and mothers but we are all the same

24258 :  i got the answer

24259 :  however there was a problem because i got somewhere around

24260 :  i love children and children love to play with me

24261 :  that is unfair but that is the reality

24262 :  audiences who may not realize that they enjoy dance because they have never

24263 :  but maybe they can go and see and enjoy a professional beautiful dance performance and then oh by

24264 :  so that we can bring these stories to new audiences

24265 :  so that we can bring science to new audiences

24266 :  we can share in the beauty of the universe as seen by a scientist

24267 :  to translate science into a brand new language

24268 :  we need to be clever about it too

24269 :  i brought one hundred and twenty chickens with yucca and with rice and we went back to

24270 :  when you see the red cross delivering food in america after a hurricane its southern baptist church doing it

24271 :  and some people will say maybe you are making the problem bigger than it was

24272 :  they belong to a bigger group called compass

24273 :  at one point we got sixteen of the best chefs that america can offer

24274 :  red cross didnt have the right answers because southern baptist church the biggest food

24275 :  i told them i want eighteen kitchens around the island

24276 :  so in the parts of the island where nobody is using them those are the parts of the island where we are going to be focusing our

24277 :  bon app tits one of the big catering companies

24278 :  so i picked up the phone and i called a company called bon app tit fedele

24279 :  we began trying to be sending the message we need to start moving away from the places that are already

24280 :  the men and women are smart they are prepared but they live under this amazing hierarchy

24281 :  you couldnt find anybody the moment you moved away from san juan

24282 :  we need to be empowering people to be successful

24283 :  what we did was a flatter organizational chart where everybody was owning the situation and

24284 :  and hed noticed that no matter how poor a situation there was always a well known fizzy drink on

24285 :  and this is where joe barnes came in

24286 :  in fact we very often find promoting water treatment on the basis of improved family

24287 :  because hed worked all over the developing world

24288 :  and who can resist an opening line like that

24289 :  not because anything goes wrong with them

24290 :  if youre lucky youll have a donkey to carry it for you

24291 :  water is quite dense

24292 :  so they get a double whammy

24293 :  hed worked in leper colonies

24294 :  hed worked in refugee camps

24295 :  so he may not have invented it but he was the person who introduced me to it

24296 :  but im trying to convince you that the water is safe

24297 :  one liter weighs one kilogram so a twenty liter jerry can will weigh

24298 :  child health benefit

24299 :  i believe youre the new physicist chappy

24300 :  well find out

24301 :  i can guarantee you whatever trouble you went to is peanuts compared to

24302 :  that was a concern weve had all the way through

24303 :  but we went back afterwards to see whether there had been any protective effect

24304 :  we were doing a study in kenya when there was an outbreak of cholera

24305 :  and you have to ask yourself well why is that

24306 :  the department of health immediately put all the emergency interventions in place

24307 :  child development benefit

24308 :  and they did this two hundred years ago

24309 :  im trying to say

24310 :  so we always say replace your bottles after six months

24311 :  we just dont know what happens after six months

24312 :  i want to go really fast

24313 :  however i will say when most people meet me they are disappointed

24314 :  how many times have we said oh i cant

24315 :  grooming is how a childs sex predator weeds out the strong kids with high self

24316 :  i already have a history of depression ive been hospitalized for being suicidal i

24317 :  my story today is a story of responsibility

24318 :  thats called our emotional response

24319 :  i was an innocent child and the abuse was not my fault

24320 :  i have to take responsibility for the fact that my abuse happened

24321 :  its called responsibility

24322 :  let go of anger and toxic people

24323 :  that feeling of happiness doesnt come from the actual moment but instead how we decide to

24324 :  when you take responsibility you will have the power to change the whole world

24325 :  i think they have the wherewithal to do it

24326 :  so dont ever give up on yourself

24327 :  i think they are going to help solve problems

24328 :  i didnt know if i was going to make it this was only twelve
24329 :  what would that mean

24330 :  now as anthropologists we know that every culture has an origin story

24331 :  thats walking abrahams path

24332 :  the path right now is like an acorn its still in its early phase

24333 :  what do i know about puerto rico

24334 :  thats the question

24335 :  his basic message was unity too the interconnectedness of it all the unity of it all

24336 :  thats a third side act

24337 :  were about to take a break in a moment

24338 :  and i think ive found in some ways what is the secret to peace

24339 :  what is the story there

24340 :  what would the oak tree look like

24341 :  the first son took his half half of eighteen is nine

24342 :  and so she told our team there she said you have made me visible

24343 :  once again i didnt expect it to be used in classrooms

24344 :  and this is something i recommend everyone in this audience do

24345 :  no we have an awesome team working on it

24346 :  but yeah its all there

24347 :  those dashboards the teachers have you can go log in right now and you can essentially become a coach for

24348 :  i have to be clear its not just me anymore

24349 :  they can watch at their own time and pace

24350 :  what im here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new

24351 :  suppose i were talking with you and i was introducing you to my uncle

24352 :  you understood exactly what i just said in english

24353 :  do you happen to know how much your house is worth

24354 :  do you mind telling me

24355 :  let me give you an example

24356 :  linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now

24357 :  chinese doesnt let me ignore it

24358 :  if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other though i wouldnt have that luxury

24359 :  excuse me would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio

24360 :  and just in summary no matter how far i push this i cant get it to break

24361 :  now how might that be

24362 :  and thats exactly what we find

24363 :  so many of you know in this room that english is a germanic language

24364 :  the global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest in something thats actually one of the oldest

24365 :  what we should expect then is the opposite effect

24366 :  four billion different ways that a family can find itself

24367 :  would you mind squeezing as hard as you can in your dominant hand this device so i can measure your grip strength

24368 :  could how you speak about time could how your language forces you to think about time affect your propensity to

24369 :  i am not saying that rape is good girls im just saying cant you just learn to take care of yourselves

24370 :  theyll actually document the evidence and put it on the internet for everyone to see what a big man they are

24371 :  in all of the time that ive been writing and writing about rape in all the emails that ive gotten

24372 :  our vaginas arent cars that we can walk away from and leave

24373 :  because what it does is that it forces us to diminish ourselves

24374 :  thats the only thing we can say causes rape

24375 :  it means that we take up less space than were entitled to

24376 :  boys think that its so much their right to treat a womans body as they please that not only would they

24377 :  and that is how things like steubenville ohio happens

24378 :  and the way we talk about rape as if its some kind of arbitrary thing that just happens to women

24379 :  we the women have to protect ourselves against them

24380 :  i dont want to be imprisoned by it and this is what i think

24381 :  but the world that people dont want to talk about because rape is not nice

24382 :  that is how things like the roast busters in auckland happens

24383 :  i am uncomfortable with the fact that because of the work that i do i stand in front of an audience like this and i automatically think

24384 :  girls when will you learn that the world is full of evil monsters and you have to protect yourselves

24385 :  we live in a world where women are taught they do not have the right to walk down the street at night because they dont have the access

24386 :  in regards to the segment on kerrie annes show this morning what she was talking about when she talked about

24387 :  and only a handful of them will ever see justice prevail

24388 :  and i think thats an act of terrorism and i will not negotiate with terrorists on those terms

24389 :  and i believe that to fix the problem you have to name the problem

24390 :  because the result of that is that they actually do start to change

24391 :  thats what rape culture looks like

24392 :  he doesnt have to be engaged in these topics because society enables him to not be engaged in them

24393 :  and the rapists was in red and the whole venn diagram was in red because the only thing common to all experiences of rape

24394 :  where was the most obvious place

24395 :  she waves and she smiles

24396 :  inside the rolls royce is the queen mother

24397 :  this girl is becoming a princess today and thats part of the excitement

24398 :  howland started her business capitalism and romance have been in bed together

24399 :  capitalism and romance worked together like a well oiled machine

24400 :  ever since ms

24401 :  there is a mother back behind everything

24402 :  the overnight fell down and

24403 :  that is the way it was and is and will be

24404 :  said big mysterys mother

24405 :  it still does

24406 :  there was i dont know

24407 :  and indeed it was chewing gum

24408 :  eventually sex and thinking got married

24409 :  we dont have to reflect on this right

24410 :  i mean how real can films get

24411 :  so ive been talking about how film has changed

24412 :  when i saw jurassic park i was blown away

24413 :  he thought he was a real prisoner

24414 :  we measured their physiological responses while they watched these

24415 :  john hammond is reflecting hes played by the late lord richard attenborough and hes reflecting on his

24416 :  and i was like duh

24417 :  theres a reason you remember things

24418 :  how will they adopt the technology

24419 :  think of media think of the television and the news services that we expect

24420 :  an example would be a self driving car

24421 :  they came up with a big record which would say exactly who owned what which they kept behind

24422 :  and you might say

24423 :  think of the capacity that individuals that families the communities have now the potential to work

24424 :  theres a lot of power involved and people are understandably attached to money its one of mans

24425 :  now bob is a very hardworking individual

24426 :  we dont really know how the future will plan out do we

24427 :  i told them the wolves were rented

24428 :  but their real calling should be more than that

24429 :  i told him the den was artificial that we made it

24430 :  the film was designed to combat the misinformation campaigns of the raunching and hunting

24431 :  i gave many talks about it and at one of these talks somebody in the audience put their hand up and said how

24432 :  ive made many other mistakes

24433 :  as a matter of fact i have a friend who goes annually to his accountant with his wife and about ten years

24434 :  com the site that i started with match

24435 :  its all anonymous but anyway i study the numbers

24436 :  i went we talked to journalists for a week and then came the final night

24437 :  there are two basic aspects of personality of course with epigenetics now we know that

24438 :  its a drive its a basic mating drive

24439 :  creativity seems to be linked with the dopamine system in the brain

24440 :  so im going to go very rapidly through these four broad styles of thinking and behaving through the

24441 :  i call them that because i was working with a dating site i needed to name these people

24442 :  i did a study of half a million people

24443 :  so i began to decide that i would study personality

24444 :  must have them

24445 :  i think more powerful than the sex drive

24446 :  almost all the people we were working with regardless of their age their gender their background were talking

24447 :  and then not only was i judging myself i started judging everyone even the monks

24448 :  why are they just sitting here

24449 :  but no matter how hard i tried my mind kept wandering off

24450 :  its good for us

24451 :  for example in the famous study of london taxi drivers the visual spatial mapping part of the brain is

24452 :  i love you shauna

24453 :  and at this point i really started to judge myself

24454 :  in fact check it out for yourself

24455 :  i love you shauna

24456 :  so n meaning just one subject right

24457 :  so i really believe in knowledge and training

24458 :  an untreated diabetic might actually have as much as fourteen percent

24459 :  so what would you do

24460 :  so i did the n one experiment

24461 :  but the ultimate power is your own experience right

24462 :  and i kind of do understand the link between chocolate and living but in any case i was

24463 :  and while most people can tolerate a fair amount of carbohydrate there might be a certain amount

24464 :  and i had very nice flat normal blood sugars

24465 :  we are finalizing the pre clinical testing and the animal model required prior to asking

24466 :  they will reach healthy organs resulting in high toxic effect for the patients

24467 :  we are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level

24468 :  so how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective

24469 :  thats the first thing

24470 :  for most beneficiaries the food stamp benefits run out by the second or third week of

24471 :  but theres also an important role for the government

24472 :  fifty a day a buck and a half a meal

24473 :  but in many important ways they are broken they are outdated and its time to change them

24474 :  so thats the new me

24475 :  behavioral is subconscious youre unaware of it

24476 :  the brain works differently if youre happy

24477 :  its beautiful and its functional

24478 :  i dont understand

24479 :  or why are you doing that

24480 :  we do it anyway

24481 :  we dislike scolding voices

24482 :  it wasnt always like this

24483 :  and unless we fix for that were not going to be able to get out of short termism and get to where we want to be

24484 :  short termism prevents congress sorry if theres anyone in here from

24485 :  he goes i love what you do

24486 :  it requires us to push into it

24487 :  it was ithaca

24488 :  what is your longpath

24489 :  its something that we actually have total control over

24490 :  he won the pulitzer prize for it in one thousand nine hundred and seventytwo
24491 :  and it all begins really with yourself asking this

24492 :  it carries a variety of sensors and the photo quality of some of these sensors can be as high as

24493 :  now as you can imagine that is a very time consuming labor intensive and costly process

24494 :  but oh how they craved them

24495 :  its a reality

24496 :  why does it present so many different opportunities

24497 :  i can attach these to one of these sensors with this little bit in the middle and i can start beaming information to other things

24498 :  its your instagram

24499 :  we are entering in a stage where everything will be connected

24500 :  who thinks ill be in the same job for the next five years

24501 :  all these different acronyms that are awesome but essentially it has gotten cheaper it has gotten faster

24502 :  its what analyzes it and allow it to do stuff

24503 :  maybe youve got an internship

24504 :  and we know technology is not always perfect

24505 :  and what about children in refugee camps or in very remote rural areas

24506 :  it works this way

24507 :  we will subsidize or even eliminate completely interest payments on the loans so that

24508 :  tunisias nobel peace prize in two thousand and fifteen as the only democracy that emerged from the arab spring

24509 :  take somalia for example

24510 :  the sad answer is no

24511 :  and what i love about this example is beyond changing the paradigm of the teacher

24512 :  you know some of them run for office and they helped raise the status of the profession so that more students

24513 :  so we came up with a solution to help countries escape the middle income trap countries that are not poor

24514 :  what this does is basically two things

24515 :  what about countries where we wont have enough qualified teachers

24516 :  and yet filipe is one of over three hundred thousand students that benefited from the

24517 :  they spend similar amounts for primary and secondary pupils as percentage of gdp per

24518 :  over twenty countries from africa and asia have committed to make education their priority and to

24519 :  penicillin was developed by a scottish scientist who came back from vacation to find a type of

24520 :  within three months my best friend from graduate school and i started a company developing and commercializing algae ink

24521 :  these bioproducts have a huge potential to make the world much more sustainable and its currently undergoing

24522 :  its people joining up with people as bundy just said miles away

24523 :  its flown around the world

24524 :  the fear is the child

24525 :  but just unpack your suitcase

24526 :  they came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns

24527 :  and i started to cry

24528 :  every cut on your arm every scrape on your knee

24529 :  case in point

24530 :  it encodes only eighteen proteins as opposed to our genome which encodes over twentythree thousand
24531 :  and so controlling mutation is the key in determining the outcome of the infection

24532 :  two different routes using the same principle of altering the mutation rate to conquer a

24533 :  whats the difference between the viruses that are up here and those viruses that are lying dead and

24534 :  these simple eighteen proteins network like this in every single infected cell to

24535 :  and yet those eighteen simple proteins are enough to highjack every system within our cell

24536 :  hiv gets around this by being highly diverse

24537 :  it adapts over time to better and better find a very specific threat

24538 :  it needs our cells for basic metabolic processing

24539 :  however thats not the end of the story

24540 :  others are around for a lifetime

24541 :  its easy to understand what happens if you have too much mutation

24542 :  so talking about jazz democracy

24543 :  that was the best audience i ever had

24544 :  jazz is like a language

24545 :  and then you see the other guy

24546 :  we are taking chances when we play

24547 :  we have a good time

24548 :  we need to challenge everyday sexism in the workplace at home within our institutions and within our

24549 :  the toys that kids play with impact their sense of reality and feelings of what they

24550 :  boys need to be tough strong hard top dog get all the cash and the ladies and of course theyll never

24551 :  we gender our kids as soon as they are born

24552 :  why did we have to do this

24553 :  what do we do about it

24554 :  and even if men as a whole group might benefit from the current system it limits opportunities for

24555 :  so again were not born feminine or masculine

24556 :  girls have much higher rates of anxiety and depression and young women are twice as likely to be hospitalized

24557 :  what was going going on

24558 :  that vision of globalization is one that has to start by a recognition of the

24559 :  geographically it was london and scotland that most strongly committed to being part of the european union while in

24560 :  its no longer just about tax and spend

24561 :  what stands out from brexit is the gap between public perception and empirical reality

24562 :  its been suggested that weve moved to a postfactual society where evidence and truth no longer

24563 :  hindsight is a wonderful thing

24564 :  everybody was blaming everybody else

24565 :  the fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization and those that

24566 :  its about globalization

24567 :  the first relates to the idea of civic education

24568 :  but amid austerity and the financial crisis of two thousand and eight the concept disappeared almost

24569 :  was it something that took place overnight

24570 :  that was the speech in which he coined that term

24571 :  the consensus amongst economists is that free trade the movement of capital the movement of

24572 :  so we have to address this misinformation the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of

24573 :  there were calls for a second referendum almost as if following a sports match we could ask the

24574 :  we need to ensure that older generations who maybe cant travel get access to the internet

24575 :  so we need to encourage exchange programs

24576 :  it creates winners and losers

24577 :  i am still a global citizen

24578 :  and he said and i paraphrase the glass house of globalization

24579 :  which one of these enigmas has already been solved

24580 :  but that never stopped us

24581 :  that particle gets its mass by interacting with the higgs boson

24582 :  anybody know heisenberg

24583 :  weve got that higgs boson

24584 :  weve developed methods over time

24585 :  its just what were made out of

24586 :  its not at all the case

24587 :  we make a whole bunch of these things

24588 :  so lets solve this ok

24589 :  theres something that can help us out

24590 :  thats what drives us thats how we survive

24591 :  therefore if we can measure that particle very carefully maybe we can solve this

24592 :  itll be something that will change it

24593 :  how do we know this

24594 :  we might be able to find something this year

24595 :  but you have to explore explore explore

24596 :  theres a key here

24597 :  the only thing that can prevent progress is a failure to admit that looking beyond the current paradigm can be useful

24598 :  states can also borrow more and usually at a lower cost which again helps to increase public expenditure

24599 :  and there was an exodus of dyers to germany and switzerland

24600 :  they kept the prices high and chased patent infringers

24601 :  and then i thought no no

24602 :  thank you so very much for having me here today

24603 :  but when they got older when the time comes for them to start think about getting married

24604 :  ah thank you very much

24605 :  i noticed its very multicultural

24606 :  its like a rainbow

24607 :  and so ive brought a couple of them with me

24608 :  and im just trying not to panic and freak out

24609 :  but i dont mind

24610 :  anyway i am here because of a young girl sarah jones

24611 :  you know shes only half jewish

24612 :  i love her too shes wonderful

24613 :  well my characters like the ones in my shows allow me to play with the

24614 :  and theyve inspired many characters as well

24615 :  and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe

24616 :  even though quite frankly some of your presentations are horrifying absolutely horrifying

24617 :  but i dont know if theres any other dominican people here but i know that juan enriquez he was here

24618 :  right now its very exciting actually for me because im the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for

24619 :  and i just i love you guys

24620 :  thank you for all that you do

24621 :  and congratulations on being such big makhers that youve become ted

24622 :  i mean i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different whatever

24623 :  oh goldie hawn

24624 :  so if you will indulge me i will share quickly with you a bit of verse which i

24625 :  i could start that business tomorrow and you would have absolutely no control over me using your data like that

24626 :  it turns out things like viral videos or facebook likes or other information spreads in exactly the same way

24627 :  so this is something weve studied for a long time

24628 :  so if youre smart you tend to be friends with smart people and if youre young you tend to be friends with young people and this is well

24629 :  and by themselves those purchases dont seem like they might reveal a lot but its a pattern of

24630 :  and i see that as a real problem going forward

24631 :  theres a lot of power that users dont have to control how this data is used

24632 :  and that i think can affect whether or not people want to share something keep it private or just keep it offline altogether

24633 :  its possible but i dont think its something that were going to see change quickly

24634 :  we can do all of this really well

24635 :  that seems to me to be a problem

24636 :  so what i want to talk to you about today is some of these things that were able to do and then give us some ideas of how we

24637 :  so users control their data

24638 :  youve probably felt something every time ive said it

24639 :  a massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly eighty percent of the

24640 :  whites were largely unscathed

24641 :  in one thousand nine hundred and ninetyfour he was head of the un peacekeeping department

24642 :  these would soar to one out of every four adults by the time i

24643 :  but we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the

24644 :  working side by side with brilliant zimbabweans scientists doctors activists

24645 :  i was providing excellent treatment such as it was

24646 :  thats why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the

24647 :  infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there

24648 :  once you learn them you can do this at your desks

24649 :  i want to tell you a story

24650 :  not the front the sides

24651 :  its quite incredible

24652 :  first i created my website with all the cool different science technology engineering and math videos

24653 :  well our brains are the exact same way

24654 :  you must reprogram your brain with different thoughts

24655 :  so thats what i did

24656 :  what we have to do is take the virus out which is called fear

24657 :  but when we take action in direct opposition from our fear something amazing happens

24658 :  my mother in law says that i have a round face and there is no way to make a round fat

24659 :  they do it and it works for them even if its temporary

24660 :  and you know what

24661 :  im also an actress but for my past seven years of doing makeup i have discovered within the

24662 :  but its actually very scary

24663 :  what would eva say to me if i apologized to eva

24664 :  but ill be honest with you

24665 :  i am a makeup artist and these are real words from real women

24666 :  in my book i went into that question as well

24667 :  and i think forcing people to uncover their head is as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it

24668 :  and there are strengths in islamic tradition

24669 :  they said we want freedom we want democracy

24670 :  and quite tellingly some muslims do practice it the muslims in north africa not in other places

24671 :  and i think its not an accident that you dont find this idea in the very origin of islam

24672 :  similarly in the arab world there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the

24673 :  thats why the ottoman empire in its last decades turned into a proto democracy a

24674 :  arab masses just revolted against their dictators

24675 :  they see an example at least to take some inspiration from

24676 :  maybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed

24677 :  so in the 20th century you had this vicious cycle in the arab world where you have a dictatorship suppressing its own

24678 :  quite quite ironic

24679 :  turkey has never been colonized so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the ottoman empire

24680 :  but we cant force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second

24681 :  so what is it

24682 :  this is slightly newer

24683 :  well this is really really exciting

24684 :  this is its stomach

24685 :  in fact because were using the water boatman as inspiration and our robot sits on top of the water

24686 :  if you choose the right microbes the microbes will eat the algae

24687 :  not only that but if you select the right kind of microbes you can use the microbial fuel cell to

24688 :  just spread them around

24689 :  so wouldnt it be nice if these robots instead of being like this made out of plastic were made out of other materials which

24690 :  how can we cope with that

24691 :  its going to totally change the way in which we think about robots but also it allows you to be really creative in the way

24692 :  so thats what we do

24693 :  we could send a message saying this is how much pollution ive eaten recently or this is the kind of stuff that ive encountered

24694 :  so thank you guys for your time i really appreciate it

24695 :  lets do it because then i can take that and do something else

24696 :  your jobs applications are not printed off this is what mike rowe does

24697 :  if you are doing your job and if you love it we are going to make you successful

24698 :  well qvc took a big dive and they are like why arent these people selling their products

24699 :  thank you very much

24700 :  we offer high quality year round sports programs for people with intellectual

24701 :  so do you mind if i do

24702 :  now i am a modern woman and i am totally ok with paying the bill sometimes and splitting the bill sometimes

24703 :  well a year after that first date we were traveling in petra jordan

24704 :  but i didnt order all of that and the bill came up to what at the time was an entire months rent for me

24705 :  so i looked at their vocabulary and language i looked at the length of the profiles they had their senses of humor how they

24706 :  my family always said i couldnt possibly email or talk to a guy first that i would seem too aggressive

24707 :  so he ordered all kinds of dishes the most expensive bottle of wine on the menu and when the bill came he

24708 :  i was in not the best relationship although it started really well and i thought that the person i

24709 :  and i said no i dont

24710 :  outside the restaurant he tried to shake my hand and i said this is interesting thank you

24711 :  and so in my drunken state thats exactly what i did

24712 :  im going to create my own mary poppins list to find a husband

24713 :  now the problem was that i had a very full schedule and the last thing i wanted to do was to sit

24714 :  i havent been picky enough

24715 :  and i thought at this point am i going to be able to stop him

24716 :  i was also looking at quantitative data

24717 :  and most importantly true love will find you when youre least expecting it

24718 :  and what that allowed me to do was to go back in and from this enormous pool of men apply my

24719 :  this entire time that ive been listening to everybodys advice

24720 :  its one of the interesting things that i found out

24721 :  in the meantime i kept scoring him

24722 :  i was too afraid to go out there and ask for and demand what i really wanted

24723 :  so im going to do three things

24724 :  sport is a competitive reward structure

24725 :  and so as an athlete youre left asking yourself what do i need to do to be successful both athletically

24726 :  and last but not least its also more convenient to buy food in a group

24727 :  and so what i thought is just to share with you how im doing my groceries everyday

24728 :  so what i would like to share with you tonight is some tips and tricks

24729 :  and thats something that we all want to happen

24730 :  youre a media company

24731 :  its our fault

24732 :  were electing regulators who dont have the backbone to actually go after these companies

24733 :  whose fault is it

24734 :  why choosy moms choose jif you love your kids more

24735 :  we are issuing twentyfive cent parking tickets on a meter that costs one hundred
24736 :  six percent wouldnt he do it

24737 :  i know at least a bit larry page for example jeff bezos i dont actually believe they wake up

24738 :  i believe its because the ratio of one percent pursuit of shareholder value and ninetynine percent the betterment of

24739 :  numbers two and three h amp m and inditex

24740 :  theyre so nice remember microsoft

24741 :  number two is lifestyle

24742 :  it shouldnt be the iphone x it should be called the iphone cross

24743 :  at one point a congressional staffer said that there was no way that i was going to be confirmed by the united states senate

24744 :  some wouldnt even utter the words

24745 :  some called it the gay plague

24746 :  but we know that we cant

24747 :  weve developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to expand prevention services treatment

24748 :  during two thousand and fourteen alone twentyeight thousand people died of drug overdoses

24749 :  and you probably wouldnt be able to tell that if you met me

24750 :  the supreme courts decision to strike down the ban on same sex marriage

24751 :  for too long our country felt like we could arrest our way out of this problem

24752 :  if you have cancer you get treatment if you have diabetes you get treatment

24753 :  right now we are in the midst of one of the greatest health crises of our time

24754 :  its whispered about

24755 :  together we can change public policy

24756 :  i continued to drink my way through college

24757 :  we see law enforcement and other first responders reversing overdoses with naloxone to give

24758 :  generally people with other diseases get care and treatment

24759 :  and after all that the knitters actually failed to break the world record

24760 :  we have to go back to two thousand and nine when one of my colleagues got a great idea

24761 :  he came at nine a

24762 :  how did we get there

24763 :  hi my name is david

24764 :  she was an object

24765 :  ive taken to calling this the willendorf effect and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her

24766 :  they experience less sexism

24767 :  what are the first words that come to mind when you picture a pregnant woman

24768 :  i also asked heterosexual men to imagine a woman that theyre partnered with is pregnant and then asked women to

24769 :  we see it in advertisements

24770 :  and in the opposite direction if we look say at the energy sector where all the talk is about how

24771 :  and we need industry structures that will accommodate very very different motivations from the amateur

24772 :  the basic story here is that what used to be vertically integrated oligopolistic

24773 :  off sustainable architecture to portrait science fiction

24774 :  its a photo thats happening now its going viral now

24775 :  this is not just wearing womens clothes this is not just expressing my feminine self this is something deeper

24776 :  we took every vacation together

24777 :  about this time ren e richards was coming up and a few others but it was so remote that it just didnt seem like

24778 :  he was wrong i am not male

24779 :  so we did get back together

24780 :  i was never a cowboy

24781 :  how many in this room were born men

24782 :  in california half of the urban water use is for outdoor irrigation

24783 :  its transported into your home thanks to a local water agency or through a pipe and a pump or

24784 :  but do we really know how much water we use every day

24785 :  just leave the water on all day when you go to work

24786 :  this isnt to judge people i eat meat

24787 :  no its not the internet

24788 :  and yet here we were less than a mile from an enormous source of fresh water

24789 :  and yet are these things the same value in terms of my life

24790 :  the average american uses about one hundred gallons a day

24791 :  think about that

24792 :  if you have a very efficient shower head its actually a twelve hour shower

24793 :  yet the children didnt have access to any of it because of poor government policies and a lack of

24794 :  and its not just about us

24795 :  we can also make smart choices as consumers

24796 :  there are other things that we can do in our communities as well for smarter water use through re use

24797 :  but my most profound appreciation for it came on a trip to zimbabwe when i was a young lawyer

24798 :  we must respect water

24799 :  simple things like moving generators and boilers to the second floor like theyve now

24800 :  are they really the biggest water hogs though

24801 :  things we do in our homes things we buy things like faucets and toilets and shower heads and

24802 :  but i have a feeling that you may appreciate it if i talked about them as a whole rather than piece by

24803 :  but once i finished the program i promptly fell apart

24804 :  on january 15th i sent an email to all my friends and relatives describing my

24805 :  and i was an amazing art student

24806 :  which is very far from a super majority right

24807 :  when many of us in this room probably realize that in a lot of regions three hundred thousand
24808 :  so every year they are at the mercy of the appropriations committee and farmers are left to

24809 :  and guess what

24810 :  and we have got to help them do their jobs and serve the next generation more effectively

24811 :  then you have to go to the owner of that farm and you have to beg them to wade with

24812 :  but none of them farmed

24813 :  life has been really tough for a lot of farm families

24814 :  or in other words i sometimes say fire needs air

24815 :  in love we want to have we want to know the beloved

24816 :  but the central agent is really that piece called the imagination

24817 :  and they may be gone but theyre never really away

24818 :  we want to minimize the distance

24819 :  sex is a place you go

24820 :  and then i began to ask the reverse question

24821 :  its a space you enter inside yourself and with another or others

24822 :  that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and

24823 :  what is the relationship between love and desire

24824 :  the more connected i became the more responsible i felt the less i was able to let go in

24825 :  all these anchoring grounding experiences of our lives that we call home

24826 :  it wont make a dent

24827 :  we want to neutralize the tensions

24828 :  are you going to be angry with me

24829 :  dont we have everything you need together you and i

24830 :  responsibility and desire just butt heads

24831 :  we want to contract that gap

24832 :  novelty is what parts of you do you bring out

24833 :  and across culture across religion and across gender except for one there are a few answers

24834 :  it starts very young

24835 :  my partner hasnt taken care of me in so long

24836 :  and those are often the people that will tell you in the beginning it was super hot

24837 :  on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go

24838 :  maybe where you leave the agile program lg

24839 :  it continues into our sex lives up to the end

24840 :  give me predictability give me surprise

24841 :  we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation which is a mortar to desire

24842 :  and when its said like that its often quite abstract

24843 :  so where do you go in sex

24844 :  these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic

24845 :  but more importantly for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark

24846 :  whats so good out there

24847 :  we can hint at it

24848 :  what do you seek to express there

24849 :  and if you tell them hey kiddo the worlds a great place

24850 :  is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive

24851 :  so when i began to think about eroticism i began to think about the poetics of sex

24852 :  but then i took a question with me

24853 :  they dont really do well together

24854 :  but if on this side there is somebody who says im worried

24855 :  its about you create a space where you leave management inc

24856 :  and people began to say i turn myself off when i feel dead inside when i dont like my body

24857 :  now if you are dead inside the other person can do a lot of things for valentines

24858 :  its no secret that the u

24859 :  and robots belong in every classroom because the hands on activities can transform learning

24860 :  its likely that robots and automation will replace a lot of their jobs in the future

24861 :  we dont know how far we can go with robotics technology yet

24862 :  they are using their robots to think with and to work together to problem solve in teams as they make

24863 :  because its easy to see if a robot moves the way it should they get immediate feedback on whether their coding

24864 :  i was told this was a great job as it was secure

24865 :  its what i wanted

24866 :  so the benefits of robots in the classroom are not just about kids engaging with the technology

24867 :  our kids will show us that

24868 :  this also gives them an appreciation of what can be done with this technology

24869 :  i went to a school where it was unusual to go to university especially for a girl

24870 :  by interacting with robots by building robots by moving and programming robots kids are

24871 :  i was that kid who not only saw a future with robots but a future where i was a teacher

24872 :  it was these hands on activities that i remember most as a kid

24873 :  i had some great teachers who really inspired me

24874 :  so next time you are talking to a young person dont ask them what do you want to be when you grow up

24875 :  the hands on application of these stem concepts lets them apply their learning and build their understanding

24876 :  but its going to take a ton of work

24877 :  i went to this talk by steve churchill who is the worlds expert on neanderthals and he puts

24878 :  well how did they get this way

24879 :  i mean when we arrived in europe we wiped out almost all of them except for wolves

24880 :  so we gave them this cooperative game where you have to cooperate with another

24881 :  we had this explosion of technology

24882 :  and it turns out that bonobos are better than chimpanzees at this

24883 :  what is it that makes us human

24884 :  he had this oven mitt because these foxes were essentially wild they would bite if you tried to hold them so he had this

24885 :  and if i rephrase that game to you and if there was somebody if you had the choice to share the one hundred with a

24886 :  i married a neanderthal

24887 :  this is seriously impressive because in order to do this your dog has to understand that

24888 :  so economic theory predicts that were just going to keep all the money because you know why would you give any of it away

24889 :  its so wonderful to be here

24890 :  so if wolves were aggressive towards people and they were larger than they are today we just would have killed them

24891 :  and you know she took it like a champ

24892 :  it was not the most genius idea but all i could come up with i was so sleep deprived

24893 :  is she going outside

24894 :  so it turns out that these foxes that dimitri had domesticated they also

24895 :  so only the super friendly wolves would have survived

24896 :  at the age of six he was diagnosed with pdd nos which is a condition on the autism

24897 :  what would i have done

24898 :  when i was fifteen i got a chance to meet a different boy

24899 :  so i pulled him aside and we got to chatting

24900 :  the answer is yes that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both

24901 :  take away the water those membranes fall apart

24902 :  the plant itself senses drought

24903 :  we are not going to feed our way out of poverty

24904 :  they reduced the footprint from one thousand seven hundred miles to seven hundred miles

24905 :  do i understand it

24906 :  and his answer surprised me

24907 :  were thinking about it

24908 :  and we adjust

24909 :  i could create all the electricity i needed with very little money because i needed less

24910 :  i changed the food i was putting into my body no more of that packaged processed junk instead whole foods

24911 :  but what i learned is that sustainable living is a spectrum

24912 :  i started to ride a bicycle more and drive the car less

24913 :  this is a national security problem

24914 :  youre in a bad neighborhood

24915 :  youre locked out of your car

24916 :  they said they would fix it then turn it back on

24917 :  some people called him a moron

24918 :  so graphene is being distorted and the consequence of it is that electrons on

24919 :  as you can imagine at this point when we have these advances in the graphene production many things

24920 :  he liked her purple hair

24921 :  do you hold it open for them

24922 :  i asked alec how he and his wife rachel met and he told me the story of a high school football

24923 :  yes i do think that knowing we are going to die someday can be a motivator for some

24924 :  there are a few things about living each day like its your last that dont make sense to me

24925 :  i know that if i say i have got to versus i really want you my entire physiology

24926 :  she started writing again

24927 :  so i would argue that we can deal with day to day routine and responsibility while pursuing our

24928 :  like most of you ive been hearing it most of my life and most recently while watching

24929 :  and seeing the world through her eyes really was kind of like seeing it through the eyes of a child

24930 :  to hear her tell the story she woke up on that morning and said uh

24931 :  what a gift future days are

24932 :  and janessa started writing again after day one hundred and eightyone because there were more days on the

24933 :  not going to go there

24934 :  and her one through five gave her joy regardless of outcome

24935 :  it doesnt have to be all or nothing

24936 :  i found where several people apparently have said it throughout history even as far back as the roman

24937 :  have you seen them

24938 :  if we live each day full of wonder and appreciation while discovering a

24939 :  so for example take risk taking

24940 :  they had no choice

24941 :  so in my lab we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan we give them some kind

24942 :  you prune away the weaker branches so that the remaining important branches can grow stronger

24943 :  it actually reflects changes in the brain that provide an excellent opportunity for

24944 :  its a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity

24945 :  so a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes in the adolescent brain is using functional

24946 :  its partly dependent on the environment that the animal or the human is in and the synapses that are

24947 :  when millions of children each and every day are becoming orphans of hiv and aids

24948 :  it can prevent things like this

24949 :  the drizzle of gold embracing the pungent scent of untouched

24950 :  because your brain still needs the excitement of dopamine

24951 :  we need to give up on the idea that we have to be connected or accessible twentyfour seven
24952 :  this way you are in charge of where youre getting information as opposed to being

24953 :  well we live in the economy that is based on distraction

24954 :  i certainly learned it twice

24955 :  for example a study by harvard business school that said that consultants knowledge

24956 :  the first time when it took me five months from the decision of

24957 :  what will you do with all this free time that all of a sudden you will have available

24958 :  you feel great

24959 :  he had an energy and a light about him that everybody wanted to be around

24960 :  he took it upon himself to create a homemade birthday card for me

24961 :  and thats where i met daniel

24962 :  but we also need to change how we think about vulnerability

24963 :  but the one point that stayed with me from that conversation was made by a jesuit priest padre

24964 :  or how we think internationally for the wider world

24965 :  were told there arent any other options

24966 :  canada for example has at times put human security at the heart of its foreign policy

24967 :  you might be able to imagine it

24968 :  what they say is

24969 :  whos up for that

24970 :  three tonnes saves themselves about six hundred
24971 :  in this country there are some excellent college education programs but

24972 :  we know that education is the truly transformative thing that helps people leave

24973 :  and almost overnight it became almost impossible to get a college education if you were

24974 :  it changes the way you think about yourself

24975 :  it changes the way that you think about the world and it changes the way that you solve

24976 :  here is what we know

24977 :  and i was very fortunate to spend four years inside of that

24978 :  but wouldnt it have made more sense for them to do that while they were locked up in prison

24979 :  they also made an indelible impression on me about the dramatic

24980 :  that is how much it transforms who you are as a person

24981 :  can you imagine that

24982 :  and to help them expand their understanding of the world and the

24983 :  we also need the thousands of colleges and

24984 :  if we want people in prison to change they must get

24985 :  i went to a womens college smith college

24986 :  they got their college education against very tough odds and they made amazing lives for

24987 :  people ask me sometimes

24988 :  i want you to think about that response

24989 :  i was not trained as a psychotherapist as an interventionist researcher

24990 :  what causes depression

24991 :  heres the thing i love though

24992 :  itll squat down on its haunches and the treadmill starts to wear the fur and the skin right off its backside

24993 :  working out would be crazy to them

24994 :  left unchecked its an illness that can cause brain damage

24995 :  the rate of depression seems to be increasing generation after generation

24996 :  brisk walking you know the kind

24997 :  i call it the brains runaway stress response

24998 :  a primary driver

24999 :  yeah i said it

25000 :  and you know what he found

25001 :  its very heavily depressant

25002 :  so every successive birth cohort is having higher rates of depression than the one that

25003 :  what did our ancestors do that protected them

25004 :  the fight or flight response was designed primarily to aid our ancestors when they

25005 :  exercise is not natural

25006 :  and heres the problem

25007 :  they dont get shut down

25008 :  the result is devastating

25009 :  i am not anti medication

25010 :  im not saying there hasnt been any change since then

25011 :  like you might miss your plane

25012 :  they have high rates of infant mortality

25013 :  and so we designed a new treatment program

25014 :  they required what

25015 :  for some yes

25016 :  and guess what

25017 :  while she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother that separate could not be equal

25018 :  and though at the time he felt stupid and dumb for trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum he should have been comforted by the simple sum

25019 :  takes just under a minute to work out that it s because of the way that he slept

25020 :  i mean this girl was wicked so he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits

25021 :  he reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her and it was different this time

25022 :  there d be a pompous paper parliament who remained out of touch and who ignored the peoples protests about all the paper cuts then

25023 :  maybe pop up purple paper people

25024 :  but i wouldn t wanna deal with all the paper people politics

25025 :  but once african industry starts to scale the potential is huge

25026 :  high import duties often compound the problem sometimes doubling the price of a car

25027 :  and they are not

25028 :  they are the three countries that are in the end receiving the refugees

25029 :  how do you imagine these people reacting

25030 :  and that is our honor code

25031 :  but ive come here today because i believe that its important to think about who we are and what we stand for

25032 :  they have all said that they do not want altrias money and that altrias identity does not align with

25033 :  others have said that this is a slippery slope where do you draw the line between the companies that you

25034 :  and about fortytwo thousand people died from second hand smoke

25035 :  its in our power to provide access for everyone

25036 :  so she had all of us come to the front of the classroom and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner

25037 :  i didnt do any of that

25038 :  if you want to do this go across the street and talk to connie

25039 :  thats one version

25040 :  these people did not let rejection define them

25041 :  it has bothered me my whole life because i was running away from it

25042 :  i couldve explained i couldve negotiated

25043 :  in fact he invited me to explain myself

25044 :  so for the next hour i was the starbucks greeter

25045 :  why is that

25046 :  i was actually a marketing manager for a fortune five hundred company

25047 :  and he said well ok ill tell my manager about it and maybe well do it but sorry we cant do this today

25048 :  people were more likely to say yes to me

25049 :  but before he could leave i said hey can i know why

25050 :  so this is where i went online and looked for help

25051 :  then i started embracing it

25052 :  i saw dead people

25053 :  i went across and knocked on connies door

25054 :  and then i learned i could fulfill my life dream

25055 :  what i really wanted to do was learn and to change myself

25056 :  and then day three

25057 :  and because i mentioned is that weird

25058 :  i just couldnt believe it

25059 :  i dont want to waste your flower

25060 :  i came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from

25061 :  that means i wasnt weird

25062 :  and she was so happy to see me

25063 :  its as if hes putting all the doubt on the floor

25064 :  well thats not quite right

25065 :  to set your own and to set them the way that you want

25066 :  so how do we get all of those things done

25067 :  that was the day that i shattered the balance myth

25068 :  we have our theories but we are never going to be able to prove our theories so our job is to try and

25069 :  i dont always know what i am talking about

25070 :  it is running a marathon

25071 :  i executive produce television

25072 :  i dont need that hum

25073 :  i make television a great deal of television

25074 :  the hum is a drug

25075 :  my brain is still global

25076 :  the hum is music

25077 :  i create television

25078 :  i couldnt restart the engine

25079 :  it is hitting every high note

25080 :  it is painting a canvas

25081 :  the hum is action and activity

25082 :  there is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good

25083 :  im not perfect at it but i try hard to practice it

25084 :  but it is ok

25085 :  it is being beyonc

25086 :  when did that happen

25087 :  harper tells people my mom wont be there but you can text my nanny

25088 :  i am not that hum

25089 :  the real hum is gods whisper in my ear but maybe god was whispering the wrong words because which one of the gods was telling

25090 :  and yet it is extraordinary because in my pain and my panic in the homelessness of

25091 :  the real hum is confidence and peace

25092 :  i play and i play until i begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place

25093 :  i love working

25094 :  i am that hum

25095 :  the more i play the better i work

25096 :  its not food from the garbage

25097 :  where is the problem

25098 :  you dont have enough food

25099 :  now imagine what you could be doing with the money that you just wasted

25100 :  lets watch this together

25101 :  now that was you at your house

25102 :  you go search for the ingredients accordingly

25103 :  so it s time to wake up and change

25104 :  but at the same while we are blind to many things and we dont see

25105 :  and the food system is a good place to start with

25106 :  but why is it that its such a huge problem

25107 :  so we took it from the sellers and we started working and cooking

25108 :  hands on hearts how much food do you think youre throwing

25109 :  so what did we do

25110 :  wait for it

25111 :  i also mist his home everyday

25112 :  everything is in place everything is in harmony in flow

25113 :  you take out one eighth

25114 :  i learned how to keep the balance between what is expected from me by my surroundings and what i really wanted in

25115 :  i can finally drop the balancing act and start living my life right

25116 :  my parents are both highly educated and liberal people my background was not religious nor

25117 :  and gradually the other boys discovered girls too

25118 :  and what is too short

25119 :  did you guys have a secret language

25120 :  and so now what i want to do is i just want to remind you all to really try starting

25121 :  i want you to repeat these words

25122 :  why am i here

25123 :  i thought i was the ugly different one among my childhood friends in

25124 :  with that in mind all of you can think about that

25125 :  because the cores are different sizes

25126 :  now why is that important

25127 :  but if you break it up you have a little piece

25128 :  now these clusters are important

25129 :  its the same thing

25130 :  its going to be important

25131 :  i want you to remember all of that

25132 :  i wanted everyone to engage with it

25133 :  was more than i could have hoped for

25134 :  these were questions that were all about how well do you know your country

25135 :  they need to carry out impact assessment to identify and fix the problems

25136 :  thanks very much for listening

25137 :  ill show you common patterns what we can learn from them and how to apply that to our life

25138 :  therere two truths i want you to notice about that

25139 :  we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy

25140 :  i personally dont think theres any room for judgment in therapy and i know thats a sentiment i share with many of my

25141 :  ninetyseven for overall improvement and one
25142 :  part of what that also means is that people continue to benefit from therapy even after they stop going

25143 :  the beauty of this kind of therapy is that it carries with it a deep respect for the

25144 :  because these numbers

25145 :  ninetyseven for overall psychiatric improvement and one
25146 :  i just didnt know what that lady was going to do to me

25147 :  so clearly i got a lot out of it

25148 :  what a trained therapist does among other things is help us to explore the role that we are playing in our own

25149 :  if we have a hard time finding a partner or if we feel incredibly frustrated with the one weve got

25150 :  an effect size of

25151 :  if every time you got behind the wheel of a car you had to learn to drive all over again it would be hard to get

25152 :  its something called insight oriented therapy and i think that in many ways its gotten a bad rap in

25153 :  the tricky part is what happens when we apply this theory of learning to our emotional lives or to human

25154 :  watch for the ripple effects

25155 :  and thats what its like with me as i am doing my research heres this gem its my favorite habit and im going to share it with you

25156 :  and it had a picture of a sailboat on it on this water

25157 :  you try another spot

25158 :  i knew that but what i didnt know was this ukulele it was an old martin with

25159 :  so he is there with his three boys

25160 :  watch for three things

25161 :  and along the way as i was sharing it im a researcher so of course im doing research on how to teach it better

25162 :  you dont do that

25163 :  and i started blaming myself that i wasnt good at paddle boarding

25164 :  a few years ago it was my birthday my partner and i were sitting out on our patio in

25165 :  how can i understand my own behavior by practicing this habit

25166 :  thats how you should practice the skill of bringing new behaviors into your life

25167 :  what is it that makes a behavior become automatic

25168 :  very black and white thinking and i think thats where it came from

25169 :  in other words it became something people did more and more automatically

25170 :  theyre more like philosophers

25171 :  but i think you need to practice in the right way

25172 :  i found myself in a corporate law firm in new york and paris

25173 :  it was president bush fortyone who said

25174 :  his name was ted sorenson

25175 :  previously society viewed me as some problem to be solved

25176 :  bush after nine eleven
25177 :  rushmore for his amazing conservation service legacy who said that

25178 :  and both parties have priorities

25179 :  studies show anxiety and unhappiness among young people is on the rise

25180 :  and if youre a young person who is disconnected from school or work or is formerly in prison you can do a

25181 :  they often talk about the adventure

25182 :  in fact in new york city there was such a response of compassion and love from

25183 :  sorenson i find myself reading books on the constitution and the lincoln douglas debates not how to

25184 :  it was president george w

25185 :  and i said mr

25186 :  but she found through word of mouth the earth conservation corps this fabulous national service experience that put her to

25187 :  oh youve done your service thats it

25188 :  it does today and we have more than two hundred colleges and universities that are creating service year

25189 :  imagine for a moment a country in which a young person has an opportunity

25190 :  part of you knows that a year of national service can put you on a better path

25191 :  republicans and democrats alike have issued the call to service down the ages and it has elicited sheer

25192 :  they would learn to believe in things until they die to develop ideas powerful enough to change the

25193 :  consider the story of my now dear friend lashantay moore

25194 :  in the end success or failure will depend upon how we conduct ourselves in the ordinary affairs of

25195 :  where you will go what you will do

25196 :  a brilliant diversity spread like stars like a thousand points of light

25197 :  so it has a huge civic effect and when bob putnam talks about bowling alone we can bowl together

25198 :  he was the one who led the floor debate for the passage of what he then called

25199 :  it was ronald reagan this may surprise you as governor of california who created the california

25200 :  and as we try to bring moneyball to government and make the effective case for national service

25201 :  i think i got them all

25202 :  it was ronald reagan who went to the republican national convention and said

25203 :  from anacostia a teenage unwed mother who had dropped out of high school

25204 :  national studies show that national service reduces chronic absenteeism and boosts math and reading

25205 :  we will restore our commitment to american community in our time and make affordable the

25206 :  our emails were lighting up with offers from friends and strangers to give a hand

25207 :  i brushed my teeth i took a shower

25208 :  but in new york city auditioning is a lifestyle auditioning is a full time job

25209 :  oh you know i just said it

25210 :  a casting team is the unsung hero of a lot of theatrical productions

25211 :  and then i waited

25212 :  i know its weird

25213 :  and so i couldnt wait

25214 :  i dont know

25215 :  how many of you have ever auditioned for something

25216 :  i eat my dinner and i wait

25217 :  so thats what i did

25218 :  so i go onto my last audition of the day

25219 :  so theyre very particular and theyre always looking for certain things depending on the show or whatever it is

25220 :  how can they remember me in any way

25221 :  they put the cast together and the units that you see which change you after the two and a half hours

25222 :  i stood inside for an hour which was awesome

25223 :  but i kind of loved it

25224 :  and thats another part that you that deal with

25225 :  but i showed up and there just seemed to be a trend

25226 :  so i tried to think how can i tell these people who i am

25227 :  and the thing about it is i was pursuing a dream

25228 :  so the casting team definitely had to knock down the music on this one

25229 :  we were all waiting in line me and bunch of other guys

25230 :  i hopped on a subway in astoria

25231 :  i was revving and ready to go

25232 :  now as mentioned i did attend penn state

25233 :  take a look

25234 :  to the table is good enough or not

25235 :  i dont know why theres so many people

25236 :  maybe theyre looking to see more people whatever the case may be

25237 :  now this is something that has never happened to me before this point or after

25238 :  and this is my favorite part

25239 :  we will have experienced something together and well never be the same

25240 :  i went into midtown manhattan

25241 :  and we were just waiting

25242 :  i was born with it

25243 :  my hopes for my son are that by then the expression her mothers son or mamas boy would have taken on a

25244 :  but this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother

25245 :  well what exactly is resilience and how do you develop it

25246 :  she mostly exists for her family

25247 :  truth be told i have never found a role model i could truly identify with

25248 :  i think its really really interesting to think of the resource like that because thats what we do to a lot of resources in the world today

25249 :  we dont need to be an expert because the expertees will reside in these radios

25250 :  its hard to allow other systems and other devices into your space

25251 :  the reality is that the vast majority of people who think about these things or engage in debate about them

25252 :  its never about the physical entity of the network itself

25253 :  as the world becomes increasingly instrumented with sensors we want to actually also talk to the objects in our lives

25254 :  but if everyone was to start whispering it would interfere with me eventually

25255 :  the best way for me to explain this at the moment is to think about this venue

25256 :  its a sociable radio its a society of radios a social network of radios is the way i see it

25257 :  they can change their behavior

25258 :  its crowded theres very very little space its really really hard to get access to the empty frequencies its

25259 :  we dont need to be an expert

25260 :  we take a mobile phone which is already a fairly fantastic and amazing device with huge amount of capabilities and we

25261 :  in my opinion we ignore the physicality of the network the network infrastructure at our peril

25262 :  they also challenge how we consume so were moving away from ownership to access were moving

25263 :  if you have to stand back and ask why that it really is because of fear

25264 :  and another term for this is a user deployed infrastructure

25265 :  what i mean by that is that everybody here can deploy wifi

25266 :  we can just go out and put it out there

25267 :  we give it eyes and ears by adding sophisticated sensors that allow it to observe the world around it

25268 :  they figure things out they decide what interferences somebody doesnt tell them what it is

25269 :  people generally dont like a yellow plum

25270 :  that is the color

25271 :  the second is the size

25272 :  is it a single serving size

25273 :  up until that point i grew up on a farm but i hadnt really thought about

25274 :  then it hit me

25275 :  they are super super cool

25276 :  its name was mesothelin

25277 :  at the end i ended up with the paper sensor that could detect a one hundred of all pancreatic ovarian and lung

25278 :  i got the lab space i needed

25279 :  and it has these amazing properties

25280 :  thats next to impossible

25281 :  so i remember it was so disappointing

25282 :  in one month we completed nine classrooms over five hundred square meters

25283 :  after a fire what are you proposing

25284 :  they have money and power

25285 :  its still used even after the current earthquake in china

25286 :  so i thought why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model to the entire planet

25287 :  plus every photograph is geotagged and time stamped providing you with proof

25288 :  how might they use this data to align their environmental and economic interests

25289 :  well let me show you

25290 :  but it had happened to be a little bit different with me

25291 :  i relieved myself of the burdens that id wrongfully shouldered and he in turn wholeheartedly owned up to

25292 :  at times our search for understanding in cape town felt like an impossible quest and all i

25293 :  once someones been deemed a victim its that much easier to file them away as someone

25294 :  and this was about analyzing our own history

25295 :  one day i stormed out of the door in tears after a fight with a loved one and i wandered into a caf

25296 :  and this marked the start of an eight year long correspondence that god knows was

25297 :  how can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats to the lives of women and children around the

25298 :  and as a result ive been reading writing and speaking about this issue for over a decade now going to

25299 :  because regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness i deserved

25300 :  our written exchanges became a platform to dissect the consequences of that night and they were everything

25301 :  despite limping for days and crying for weeks this incident didnt fit my ideas about rape

25302 :  but it doesnt have to be that way

25303 :  they have permanently altered their gut flora

25304 :  it didnt run too far it ran maybe another twenty feet turned around and stood on its hind legs just to get a

25305 :  every next step is a possibility where you have to decide you have to make that choice

25306 :  i want to see how the sunrise affects this canyon in a different way every time

25307 :  the cracks were my routes the map was one to one the land itself was the map i

25308 :  what about those languages that tell us how to move on the ground how to follow

25309 :  it becomes possible in a way that just cant happen indoors

25310 :  you can still run into a bear and be speaking with it

25311 :  he said you know we were so focused on the mountain back then

25312 :  we spend so much time making the land adjust to us making the world change for

25313 :  to a place that is more than human

25314 :  jasper said can i take a picture of it

25315 :  we need to travel out there and we dont have to suffer out there

25316 :  we open the doors outside and the world changes

25317 :  build up that language enter that world

25318 :  when you watch kids its not just all blood and guts

25319 :  thats all it takes

25320 :  its saying im very interested in you

25321 :  they might feel that they didnt get the right one

25322 :  they send out a team

25323 :  its called walker air force base

25324 :  i never really wanted to be a non fiction writer

25325 :  i hated non fiction growing up

25326 :  it was their original project

25327 :  but the question is really about you

25328 :  however the entire social contract will need to change in order to accomodate this

25329 :  how can we understand the world in rapidly changing

25330 :  the first is the energy shift

25331 :  if a company has standardized as the leader of fast food industry

25332 :  is the main power source of our society today

25333 :  and this phase changes are what i want to talk about because as human beings

25334 :  but over and over over these seventyfive years our study has shown that the people who fared the

25335 :  once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s we wanted to look back at them at

25336 :  the people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age fifty were the healthiest

25337 :  they all finished college during world war ii and then most went off to serve in the war

25338 :  and when about a decade ago we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study

25339 :  most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the

25340 :  fashion refers to the articles one wears but style is how you put it together and how confident you feel

25341 :  though fashion and architecture clearly aim to identify certain cultural and societal identities

25342 :  he was a ship designer

25343 :  and she knew that she lived too because of it

25344 :  but nobody could imagine what was coming

25345 :  my father taught me how to be above that

25346 :  they were doing so many kinds of projects

25347 :  sure we can demand that our governments have high level discussions to eliminate the weapons of war but we can come

25348 :  hes the double survivor they call him

25349 :  i kind of felt like forrest gump

25350 :  how could one bomb destroy an entire city

25351 :  eighty percent of rikuzentakada was washed away

25352 :  he was severely burnt

25353 :  and i met the japanese ladys family and i asked them if they would work with me and help me write this book

25354 :  he told his co workers what happened

25355 :  his name is edward burger

25356 :  or how about this one

25357 :  an event exploding with opportunity to acquire knowledge deepen understanding and to emotionally

25358 :  at my school i talk to my teachers about this concept and ask them to go back to the class and to celebrate share and learn

25359 :  rather they went in the midst of ongoing struggle

25360 :  in fact i believe out of all the things we should be teaching in our schools right now the most important thing of all is

25361 :  but i dont want our children to wait that long

25362 :  let me give you an example of a person whom i think is on a right track

25363 :  it happens to be the definition of the word education

25364 :  but i know we have to start small

25365 :  and most importantly its not the opposite of success as most people believe it is a key component of it

25366 :  and dont we need more of both of those in the world in which we live in today

25367 :  and we start thinking along those lines

25368 :  and then i hit high school

25369 :  i want you to experience the frustration of not solving your problem or creating your idea on the

25370 :  the reason for this is simple

25371 :  while we may not be sure one thing is certain we will not want this plant to disappear

25372 :  its a plant

25373 :  four percent of the entire land surface already provides for thirtyfive percent of the

25374 :  i had read the stories how the hawaiians originally found hawaii

25375 :  clarke said famously any sufficiently advanced civilization is indistinguishable from

25376 :  according to our estimates we can get this accomplished in twenty years for an annual cost of

25377 :  i wasnt always this enthusiastic although ive always been a strong believer in space

25378 :  what were doing is creating the first generation of a new life form a type of

25379 :  did you know that a simple rock is fifty oxygen by weight

25380 :  were creating this machine life form this robotic ecosphere this robotosphere

25381 :  there are not enough other natural resources and if we tried to move too far in that direction it would be an

25382 :  your grandchildren can grow up in a world that is so alive itll make our present era

25383 :  it turns out this was important for the hawaiians for a couple of reasons

25384 :  they would be talking excitedly about some measurement they were making in a star far across the galaxy

25385 :  we are not simply creating technologies to make a mars mission more affordable

25386 :  every day on this hike thinking about these things and contrasting them i began to realize

25387 :  and then we can fill mars with forests and lakes and streams with fish and there would be birds in the sky

25388 :  how rapidly can we stand up a robotosphere in our solar system

25389 :  they came from tahiti over two thousand five hundred miles away in dugout canoes across open

25390 :  you might have guessed i dont believe that anymore and heres what happened that changed my perspective

25391 :  despite this fantastical one thousand
25392 :  in two thousand and eleven i pulled together a few of my collaborators to ask the question

25393 :  i want to promise you this is not science fiction this is science fact

25394 :  thank you so much for letting me share this enthusiasm with you today

25395 :  we are doing this today

25396 :  and how much will it cost

25397 :  that is not in the realm of the possible

25398 :  that s the point where the vision i described at the start of this talk has become the new reality for human

25399 :  children who are exposed to chronic stress are prone to mental problems such as

25400 :  she was exhausted and she felt unappreciated

25401 :  i told her to stop

25402 :  there is no perfect day or moment to come

25403 :  when we decide to run a marathon we dont run fortytwo kilometers on our first

25404 :  but i also have moments that dont make me proud of myself

25405 :  the paradox is that more than anything in our lives we want our children to

25406 :  children dont need a stress free life

25407 :  and it is my motivation to never give up

25408 :  on the way to school she sat in the back in the car and instead of being the happy

25409 :  he could have made me

25410 :  on one really hot summer day on a campus a prospective family was being walked

25411 :  and a tractor ride it was

25412 :  i have come to believe its the one thing worth living for

25413 :  this is my memory of my father and my

25414 :  this isnt for the you know the academic intellectual in the ivy towers of the greatest universities of the

25415 :  okay but where do your values come from

25416 :  and you stay stuck

25417 :  so whats the next branch

25418 :  so now what should i do

25419 :  dont try to be something youre not

25420 :  they ask a lot of why

25421 :  where does it come from

25422 :  people talk about oh there was breakthrough

25423 :  okay so thats your view of reality

25424 :  it gets kind of complicated

25425 :  whats implied in that

25426 :  and it becomes a recurring or a redundant pattern in life

25427 :  contrast that with a different view that says

25428 :  id like to make a distinction

25429 :  what makes you different than every other form of animal on the planet is the fact that you can choose a

25430 :  in essence ethics asks the question

25431 :  we all i think believe in compassion

25432 :  what do you have to do

25433 :  so like snoopy we cant just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbors

25434 :  what does it mean dough becomes leaven

25435 :  he goes to the ark

25436 :  it means it gets filled with hot air

25437 :  next week with raisins

25438 :  if you put boiling water in it will shatter

25439 :  take the bread

25440 :  because after all god is just

25441 :  it entails understanding the pain of the other

25442 :  he goes in there and its not there

25443 :  what does this compassion entail

25444 :  but something else as well actually eighteen minutes is important

25445 :  and within jewish teachings the rabbinic teachings we have hillel who taught that you

25446 :  take it home

25447 :  therefore there should be justice throughout the world

25448 :  oh god im in such trouble

25449 :  went on until a new rabbi came

25450 :  if you look at all the world religions all the main world religions youll find within them some

25451 :  i call that unity god

25452 :  so when i thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips

25453 :  ive got no money

25454 :  and he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the torah

25455 :  youve answered my question

25456 :  i know what god wants

25457 :  ive got children to feed

25458 :  so in judaism we have from our torah that you should love your neighbor as you

25459 :  rabbis always spoil things

25460 :  he goes into the synagogue

25461 :  and as we watched what we were doing and looked at the kinds of engagement we were getting from the children we realized we

25462 :  education should be the first thing

25463 :  we owe it to children to create a world that is more engaging

25464 :  we know that the school that these people are making in madrid is going to be nothing like the school that we have

25465 :  i needed to make it

25466 :  strange and wonderful things began to happen at our school

25467 :  thank you so much

25468 :  everything everything is interesting

25469 :  lift air speed drag center of gravity

25470 :  and i ve been truly honored to co lead this consortium together with drs

25471 :  or you open our post box and you find piles of advertisements we call that junk

25472 :  you can see why the bubble is important

25473 :  i wanted to keep my father happy so i sacrificed my biggest passion for performing to become a

25474 :  ill even tell it to you now

25475 :  it might take you three years ten years or twenty years until you are able to speak about

25476 :  but how would i know if she was feeling well or was it just another bipolar

25477 :  i was very surprised to see that so many people shared my experience and for the first time

25478 :  im so happy that im coming to the meeting tomorrow

25479 :  he was really at risk of not making it out of high school

25480 :  and when a spot opened up in the kitchen he offered it to the guy

25481 :  this is what we want for teenagers

25482 :  and when i say growing up

25483 :  i think youve got some say

25484 :  i cant wait to tell you about my plans for the weekend

25485 :  and you could

25486 :  and still young peoples choices now reflect that old information

25487 :  not that we need many pilots really

25488 :  we come back to the fact that the only point of reference is really yourself

25489 :  so is that a problem

25490 :  nothing wrong with that but i guess we have produced far too many of these in the last twenty years anyway

25491 :  now but which should you invest in

25492 :  and out of that field campaign well probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules

25493 :  and thats in the patients where they do work

25494 :  thats sort of this preconceived framework with which we approach problems

25495 :  and that actually makes repurposing pretty hard for all of us which is i guess why they gave a tv show

25496 :  so we ran it again

25497 :  and we only published this a year ago but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect

25498 :  and mental set is another thing

25499 :  when doctors first saw this mood enhancing effect of iproniazid they didnt really recognize what they

25500 :  they have two other things in common that are really important

25501 :  its actually not that surprising they were caught

25502 :  so we did what you do in science when youre not sure and we ran it again

25503 :  that means no matter how much time or money or effort we put into it it will never

25504 :  they were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease they could not see the larger

25505 :  a painkiller will make you feel better but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease

25506 :  and like i said we only gave a tiny amount of the drug and it lasted for weeks and thats not like anything you

25507 :  and this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging

25508 :  it was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery

25509 :  five trillion dollars and since they are chronic that cost is compounding and is therefore

25510 :  it didnt really look right to me

25511 :  the extraordinary amount of work that tolkien put into creating the world of middle earth and unfortunately

25512 :  so i sent it to a website

25513 :  so i wanted to know more about this world so i started reading the silmarillion

25514 :  but i would often drift off in mind imagining being on some grand adventure with aragorn or gandalf

25515 :  but the feedback has been quite tremendous

25516 :  and so i did

25517 :  sort of like a sidekick i wasnt the main character

25518 :  and it has profoundly changed me as a person

25519 :  is it golden blond

25520 :  is it amber blond

25521 :  they are not afraid of using crazy ingredients like tonka beans from amazonia

25522 :  actually we need three things

25523 :  when we speak about science we need to speak in an easy and simple arabic language

25524 :  and how can it be done

25525 :  and this was the sparkle of what ill tell you about today

25526 :  if you have any question about anything go and ask the syrian researchers

25527 :  this is amazing

25528 :  so what do we need

25529 :  so this is a problem

25530 :  they also want to be the protagonists of their own stories

25531 :  and im not only saying about photoshop

25532 :  which leads me to the second component

25533 :  women that we see in ads are often not real

25534 :  what do you want

25535 :  brands are not saying hey you woman i want to talk to you

25536 :  they dont want to be objectified anymore they want respect for their bodies and identities

25537 :  so it all starts with

25538 :  they want brands that communicate straight to them hey what do you want

25539 :  ive been thinking about it after seeing some numbers in brazil saying that sixtyfive percent of women dont feel

25540 :  i want to please you

25541 :  and probably the third time you will come directly to this room without getting lost because youve memorized

25542 :  our preferences change as well

25543 :  i may decide that the discomfort of getting out of bed early is less

25544 :  i simply want to stay in bed

25545 :  how do you do that

25546 :  and all this by simply watching the childs brainwaves

25547 :  he said yes yes

25548 :  i hope no ones hurt

25549 :  its based on thousands of years of wisdom tradition in asia

25550 :  watch it all pass moment by moment

25551 :  just hang on

25552 :  its really obvious

25553 :  but at the very top they had written

25554 :  and even when they got out they could be barred from voting or housing if they had a felony conviction

25555 :  it was a tough on crime period

25556 :  although it wasnt what youd expect

25557 :  i felt like i was doing what id wanted to do all those years ago when i taught my class in new york

25558 :  it was a college class id taught before although never in a prison

25559 :  why shouldnt women have the same opportunity

25560 :  but the women in the prison had very little say about what went on where they currently lived

25561 :  its working in this prison and it can work elsewhere

25562 :  when i grew older i heard stories

25563 :  to all of you i would ask

25564 :  it really bothered a lot of my students that they had to look at a visible symbol of freedom from behind bars

25565 :  these were the stories that mattered

25566 :  i felt galvanized

25567 :  i was too busy working as a professor

25568 :  my aunt got out of prison

25569 :  when that happens i think we will have made prisons a point of departure

25570 :  as a teacher in a prison you wont have fancy technology and you wont have the internet

25571 :  and one woman said it means having a voice or say in what goes on in your country or where you live

25572 :  if you educate a woman you educate a nation

25573 :  to empower women through education

25574 :  women in prison might be just a small proportion of the total prison population but they are the fastest growing

25575 :  no one in my extended and tight knit family spoke with my aunt except for my mom

25576 :  washington followed suit and banned all state public funds for college in prison

25577 :  even a horticulturist and a cosmetologist will go that much farther with a college degree

25578 :  it seemed like the cycle was just repeating itself

25579 :  can we imagine differently

25580 :  i know that over eighty of the women who take our college classes at this prison are mothers too

25581 :  and i really believe thats true

25582 :  an imposing building set off in the middle of nowhere

25583 :  to men and women in prison i would urge you to ask the administration of the prison to offer

25584 :  but why cant you imagine being a scientist or a writer

25585 :  and in my simplistic view it is this

25586 :  my nine year old son is always the car a very strategic player

25587 :  youre laughing because its true

25588 :  in fact if ever youre in a line and someone in front pulls out their chequebook to pay you are liable to say to

25589 :  peter drucker famed leadership guru said banking and finance industries today are less about money and more about information

25590 :  she was the first one bankrupted lg

25591 :  but what snapped me back to reality was hearing my son behind me say i sure wish i had a phone so i could

25592 :  i realised it was the single best thing they could have ever done for me

25593 :  in the confines of my experiment there is an idea worth spreading and it is this

25594 :  i met an american named jos

25595 :  to which theyd say dad its fine

25596 :  i resented my parents for a year

25597 :  we can make a start

25598 :  the key to success in the world economy the united states success in the world economy is innovation

25599 :  as a nation it is so important to us

25600 :  there are many other projects

25601 :  i admitted i had a problem

25602 :  and i chose to live

25603 :  but im not alone

25604 :  it doesnt just replace the words

25605 :  i mean how can we do those without words

25606 :  my small amount of money each week

25607 :  so its these ideas that i ask you

25608 :  thats a large impact to think about my money

25609 :  it gave backpacks to children who had never had backpacks to go back to school

25610 :  invite people into your space

25611 :  try that on

25612 :  so theres two ways to find money through creatively looking into the world around you but also reaching into your own

25613 :  im lucky enough to meet a big group of people who are doing textbook fundraising

25614 :  algae biofuels just simply arent competitive with fossil fuels

25615 :  but if we can increase the oil yields of algae we might be able to make them a feasible contender

25616 :  i even sleep on my algaes light cycle

25617 :  sixteen hours on eight hours off

25618 :  its clean its carbon neutral

25619 :  but my ideas about research got turned on their head when i went to my first science

25620 :  and this was the idea that i worked on developing designing and implementing over the past

25621 :  so what this seems to mean is that i seem to have caused a lasting genetic change in my algae populations

25622 :  techniques that are supposed to go smoothly dont

25623 :  i found this community of people who were also loving science who were doing their own

25624 :  i emailed professors and faculty members at universities asking questions begging for lab

25625 :  tiny projects paper mache volcanoes nothing that truly smacked of actual

25626 :  the thing is that research isnt easy

25627 :  im just about to do fire

25628 :  it was like vegetable jerky and killed all of them

25629 :  perhaps more working class or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative

25630 :  what i needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people

25631 :  so now more than ever companies need not only diversity of identity and culture but diversity of

25632 :  so in the age of transparency that we live in the internal and the external reality of what a company

25633 :  i will never forget the recovery period where you must remain completely silent for two weeks and when youre

25634 :  and remember in those days i knew of no successful out role models in the performing world

25635 :  so if diversity is a priority it shows up in the bottom line

25636 :  so you cant buy this kind of endorsement

25637 :  as i started to build my career as a professional vocalist i struggled continually with vocal

25638 :  but i had come to the edge of something much more significant that would change my life

25639 :  we get to a catastrophe and we wonder how did it get so bad

25640 :  all of my neighborhood friends were experiencing an educational train wreck that i was

25641 :  i am the daughter of two hardworking college educated african american parents who chose

25642 :  why doesnt everyone get this

25643 :  how come my neighborhood friend dont have to wake up at five oclock in the morning and go to a school thats an hour

25644 :  we keep focusing on the end results or test results and getting frustrated

25645 :  and then id reply strangers from all over the country wanted you to have these

25646 :  what is a scientist with no laboratory

25647 :  there are thousands of other kids just like me who deserve this too

25648 :  equal and equitable

25649 :  but as i got older i started noticing things like

25650 :  what is an actress with no stage

25651 :  people coming from the same local community from the same background from the same struggles

25652 :  good afternoon everyone my name is zaher baraky im here studying my executive mba at ecole h teli re

25653 :  and they are actually proposing a social enterprise that would help create jobs and reduce bike

25654 :  in the end we decided that the water hyacinth was the actual icon that made the most sense because it was the

25655 :  we need to look at many of us as the expert

25656 :  and in this case it changed the world

25657 :  but i also love dr

25658 :  he actually believed you had to ingest it through your mouth and in one thousand eight hundred and fiftyfour when cholera broke

25659 :  for example telling them this is called a grapefruit whatever youre holding right now

25660 :  and thats called an apple et cetera

25661 :  they have to basically make suggestions recommendations and offer

25662 :  when you think that porn is the major form of sex ed think what is going to happen to the next

25663 :  but you know what

25664 :  my son is worth better than this

25665 :  the first age of using pornography is twelve
25666 :  dick was imprisoned for raping his twelve year old stepdaughter and he was

25667 :  and you know why

25668 :  lets go back to details

25669 :  what do you want her to do

25670 :  they were on the internet for everything

25671 :  if they dont do that then they have to drink two or three shots

25672 :  does anyone else remember that

25673 :  and then they dont have anyone to talk to because they know thats bad

25674 :  how do i know theyre watching porn

25675 :  all of a sudden they had mobile technology

25676 :  theyre always going to be smarter than us because to them it isnt technology

25677 :  oh i dont do that

25678 :  if you dont provide your children with leadership of course will turn somewhere else

25679 :  theyre up all night watching porn

25680 :  its just awkward

25681 :  i didnt really like him that much so i wouldnt let him kiss me

25682 :  tell me whats going on take me through a day

25683 :  every single parent that ive talked to of a teenager all say are they looking at porn

25684 :  they tell me all the time

25685 :  i was the only one that wasnt going oh yes

25686 :  so i said ok i need to talk to him

25687 :  ill even ask eight year olds

25688 :  i say what do you look at on the internet

25689 :  then they drag their mouth down the guys penis leaving a rainbow behind

25690 :  every single parent says i dont think so

25691 :  when we are hungry we can go to the refrigerator and get a snack

25692 :  be aware of those understand those effects and take responsability for your actions toward others

25693 :  all of these are variations on the experience of loneliness

25694 :  not long ago we thought about the genes as the keyboard on which lifes song played out

25695 :  or you may have realised already of course that these both may be self evident truths but they cant

25696 :  i was looking through the lens of my camera

25697 :  this was my responsibility this was my opportunity

25698 :  not just in pakistan but in the world

25699 :  a tiny drop in a cosmic ocean yes but sometimes one drop is all it takes to

25700 :  he was given roughly one thousand days to live

25701 :  when i was two my parents wanting to give my brother and i a proper education decided that they would move

25702 :  so here i am in spirit

25703 :  i knew the children of akri dreamed the same dreams i did and we shared the same strings

25704 :  and the fire burnt hard

25705 :  with no proper schools around we were homeschooled much of our lives

25706 :  our strings are what can light the brightest fire within us

25707 :  while our strings can hold us back our strings can also give us direction

25708 :  to date my mother must have taken care of hundreds of thousands of patients our entire

25709 :  i took their pictures so i would always remember them and i asked them what they wanted to be when they grow up

25710 :  think about it

25711 :  and devised a plan against them

25712 :  instead if each of us embraced our strings not so that we can be tied down by them but so we can

25713 :  the kid with the piercing eyes with the slight hesitation in his voice looked at me and he said

25714 :  kids all over the ends of pakistan were dreaming big audacious dreams of becoming

25715 :  he stretched those strings far and wide and he challenged them just as much as his strings

25716 :  i asked what do you want to be when you grow up

25717 :  with the support of an amazing group of friends colleagues and partners we formed our organization the

25718 :  what if we could question them challenge them reshape and reform them

25719 :  we have to be here

25720 :  theyre most often about changing peoples relationship with islam rather than preserving it

25721 :  when i look back now i think that that was the moment that set me on the path was to writing a book called your

25722 :  you and father must keep your heads held high

25723 :  in fact amels sister lamia overcame her grief went to law school and practices as a lawyer in

25724 :  theyre not conservative or traditional approaches

25725 :  some do not though theyre often interrelated

25726 :  and she said i know that but i came to your festival with my mother when i was their age and i

25727 :  as faizan said at the time if we bow down to the islamists well just be sitting in a dark corner

25728 :  since that time mr

25729 :  far away in the american midwest i had the good fortune of meeting somali americans who were working to counter the

25730 :  but in any case these are all radical projects

25731 :  and it is simply that for her a better future for all the maria bashirs to come is worth the

25732 :  some use and advocate violence

25733 :  an afghan prosecutor has been assassinated

25734 :  now how can this be

25735 :  i want to share something that ive discovered

25736 :  every day that i went to work i was helping someone have access to materials that they might not have otherwise had

25737 :  just didnt really care

25738 :  but over time i realized that helping someone get to that aha moment for them to realize

25739 :  got in trouble

25740 :  things like they were lazy theyre drunks why dont they just get a job

25741 :  i had an interview and i got the job

25742 :  so i put in an application

25743 :  i had been cast off from society

25744 :  my family was walking though balboa park in san diego california and i saw a man sleeping on a bench

25745 :  sure id heard things about the homeless

25746 :  his clothes were dirty and tattered and even though it was warm he was wearing many layers of clothing

25747 :  and those first few steps

25748 :  i do not have anybody to go with

25749 :  or the tools or language to know what is actually happening

25750 :  she has friends from all over and different groups now because she knows who she is

25751 :  this program is about connecting girls with girls

25752 :  i wanted to lean back and push my feet up until they hit the clouds and just kept going

25753 :  whats happening now in this third age of space flight is that the frontier is opening

25754 :  well once we got over the idea that this was simply an environment to be survived we started to select our astronauts for

25755 :  and that right stuff meant very very few people could go

25756 :  even when we got to the 1990s and the chinese were bringing a space program online they had the same mentality

25757 :  today were finally discussing what this hospital does the right way

25758 :  but most of them dont know

25759 :  fifty percent risk

25760 :  in fact no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all

25761 :  its about retelling the story of the poor and its about giving ourselves an

25762 :  this is what jesus asked of us

25763 :  i heard about disease i heard about war they always seemed to be kind of related

25764 :  so that this belief in each other knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you

25765 :  and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month

25766 :  because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for

25767 :  i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor

25768 :  and just because someone says

25769 :  but it is not enough to just say how exciting it is you have to determine which direction you are going to go in

25770 :  but at the same time that isnt the story that the cuban people i met along the roads and in towns across this country

25771 :  they wished they had greater access to the information superhighway of the world and they wished it were more easy for them to

25772 :  this is of course a human rights concern for anyone like myself who makes it their lifes focus

25773 :  and in fact princeton university just a week ago published a study saying that the united states is in fact

25774 :  cuba literally has a program of teaching young people environmentalism in the schools

25775 :  i myself had an emergency in the past week while i was here in cuba

25776 :  and as you see across american life this kind of pain of that sort of wealth distribution and

25777 :  here i think we have two paths that diverge

25778 :  four hundred people with more money than one hundred and fifty million people

25779 :  we implanted electrodes in the fornix of patients with alzheimers disease we turned it on and we looked at what happens to

25780 :  we want you to stop doing that

25781 :  and we do that with electricity

25782 :  but this was common

25783 :  that is the essence of seeing a person first

25784 :  imagine walking down ren l vesque boulevard and seeing homeless men huddled together trying to stay warm in the

25785 :  anyone here who has donated their time or their energy to a good cause remembers how wonderful it felt to be a

25786 :  little did i know that at nine years old a common ear infection would change my whole perspective on life

25787 :  think about it

25788 :  poverty hunger and homelessness not only exist in ethiopia or kenya but you

25789 :  its going to be on november 15th and there is going to be a live stream and hopefully you

25790 :  and that just launched really officially in january of this year and there are already twelve of those ted ed clubs here in

25791 :  many of us will walk out of here thinking of doing something a little different or maybe having a different lens on an

25792 :  im too scared

25793 :  and its so fun to watch this grow as a movement and think about how the first time it happened was right

25794 :  we pair up educators with animators to create lessons and teachers

25795 :  rives and i were invited to come and host

25796 :  imagine if you will having to schlep everything on your back

25797 :  yes photography is awesome

25798 :  how many times have you used the word awesome today

25799 :  weve been told its about ridding our culture of sexist thinking in order to liberate women

25800 :  i have a father

25801 :  i saw eyes that could break cycles and redefine what masculinity meant for a new generation of

25802 :  earlier in the year a team of researchers at stanford announced theyd developed a system which can tell you whether or not a

25803 :  theyve fallen for the intelligence myth the belief that machines have to copy the way that human

25804 :  so what do these three myths tell us then

25805 :  think how often you hear people say to you machines can only perform tasks that are predictable or repetitive rules

25806 :  as this worker used the machine and became more productive the price of washers would fall demand for washers would rise

25807 :  those economic pies have exploded in size

25808 :  and today you hear people talk about the lump of labor fallacy to think about the future of all types of work

25809 :  theres countless systems out there that can diagnose medical problems

25810 :  resolving this terminator myth shows us that there are two forces at play one machine

25811 :  as other economists have noted solving this problem wont be easy

25812 :  to see this go back to the case of making a medical diagnosis

25813 :  and these things are very difficult to articulate and so it was thought these tasks would be very hard to automate

25814 :  the lump of work wasnt fixed

25815 :  a picture that we see on our television screens in books in films in everyday commentary is one where an army

25816 :  technological progress rather than complement human beings complements machines instead

25817 :  how does it work

25818 :  theres no fixed lump of work out there to be divided up between people and machines

25819 :  economists call these effects complementarities but really thats just a fancy word to capture the

25820 :  this is the path were currently on

25821 :  new tasks have to be done

25822 :  theres a great deal of discussion for instance about various forms of universal basic income as one

25823 :  human beings only stand to benefit if they retain the upper hand in all these complemented tasks but

25824 :  it didnt matter that that human being that doctor couldnt explain how shed performed the task

25825 :  almost everyone lived on or around the poverty line

25826 :  if economic growth continues at two percent our children will be twice as rich as us

25827 :  innovative work can be very exhilarating but it also can be really downright

25828 :  partway through one production an animator drew a character with an arched eyebrow that suggested a

25829 :  its because theyve mastered the capabilities required for that

25830 :  when the director saw that drawing he thought it was great

25831 :  the final capability is creative resolution

25832 :  for sure there are times when visionary leadership is exactly what is needed

25833 :  this is about doing decision making in a way that you can actually combine even opposing ideas to

25834 :  they want to cocreate with me the future

25835 :  on the contrary it takes about two hundred and fifty people four to five years to make one of those

25836 :  how did he see his role

25837 :  when many of us think about innovation though we think about an einstein having an aha

25838 :  what do they focus their time on

25839 :  its a type of collaborative problem solving usually among people who have different expertise and different

25840 :  if we want to invent a better future and i suspect thats why many of us are here then

25841 :  bill said i lead a volunteer organization

25842 :  we studied a general counsel in a pharmaceutical company who had to figure out how to get the outside lawyers

25843 :  when they dont work someone or something is to blame

25844 :  pilots are often about being right

25845 :  because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you werent seeing the kind of bottom up innovation

25846 :  so they began to work on that

25847 :  what can we do to make sure that all the disruptors all the minority voices in this organization speak up

25848 :  the head of the engineering group and the infrastructure group at that time was a man named bill coughran

25849 :  im never a dictator of viewpoints

25850 :  bill and his leadership team who he referred to as his brain trust had to figure out what to do about this

25851 :  instead of creating a group to tackle this task they decided to allow groups to emerge

25852 :  lets think for a minute about what it takes to make a pixar movie no solo genius no flash

25853 :  early in that process one of the engineers had gone to bill and said were all too busy for this inefficient

25854 :  advice about how you exercise the role

25855 :  they also learn how to advocate for their point of view

25856 :  we ended up with pages and pages and pages of field notes that we analyzed and looked for patterns in what

25857 :  in the twenty years hence theyve produced fourteen movies

25858 :  but if im trying to do something thats truly new i have no answers

25859 :  and finally lets bestow credit in a very generous way

25860 :  so they selected that one

25861 :  not on creating a vision

25862 :  one became known as big table the other became known as build it from scratch

25863 :  he admitted if you had forced us to all be on one team we might have focused on proving who was right

25864 :  its about discovery driven learning where you act as opposed to plan your way to the future

25865 :  when we met vineet his company was about in his words to become irrelevant

25866 :  lets put in a policy that anyone no matter what their level or role is allowed to give notes to the director about how

25867 :  and guess what

25868 :  i dont know what direction were going in and im not even sure i know how to figure out how to get there

25869 :  a world where youre living at the frontier

25870 :  you can blame me its fine

25871 :  you win on all fronts

25872 :  he was working overseas

25873 :  thirdly it brings the interesting people to you

25874 :  when these laws work together they bring about the beautiful messy complex world we live in

25875 :  the day we drop an apple and it goes up then well have a debate about gravity

25876 :  i got this text message back from him a couple of weeks later and it said im at breakfast in a posh

25877 :  when you stop the other one you only stop the shell the liquid inside is still rotating because nothings made it stop

25878 :  then i left the stage

25879 :  what can you do when you know that

25880 :  we shouldnt be afraid to investigate the physical world for ourselves with the tools around us because we all have access

25881 :  so we combined these needs with technologys themes

25882 :  this will be very different in the future

25883 :  these are the future anthropometrics

25884 :  we use these things as stopgaps for things that we cant explain

25885 :  the person says yes

25886 :  and ive done over seventy investigations like this with my co host ross

25887 :  do you agree with it

25888 :  nothing got better

25889 :  at one time wolves occupied over ninetyfive percent of the north american landscape

25890 :  and he is from the red lake nation

25891 :  and i waited for him

25892 :  i knew that i was going to make this film about wolves

25893 :  and one day bozo did not come back

25894 :  but thats not enough to explain a human obsession

25895 :  but the one thing that kept gnawing at me over and over again was how little neuroscience had trickled down into this model

25896 :  then if you listen to the entire sentence again it will sound as if the person bursts into song

25897 :  you can think of the caudate as your parent

25898 :  how could these judges gauge my musicality

25899 :  classical musical training follows the apprenticeship model where you study with one or two teachers for many years

25900 :  our minds have evolved in such a way that when we dont have those things we seek them out

25901 :  that i couldnt see ten years ago

25902 :  so i developed a course called training the musical brain how to use neuroscience to develop more effective practice

25903 :  i was devastated

25904 :  the way that dopamines awash in the brain while youre getting the chills from music is very specific to when and where it

25905 :  sounds can be noise in one context and music in another

25906 :  it turns out that when your brain is enjoying a piece of music that might even give you the

25907 :  those rats wanted nothing more than to press that lever

25908 :  food water sex

25909 :  thats what she does for a living she gives pleasure and she gets exhausted by the party but at the party she

25910 :  thats what i learned thats what it means to be musical

25911 :  but the more desire there is the better the pleasure

25912 :  dopamine despite its widespread fame has actually been undersold in many ways people think of it as the pleasure chemical

25913 :  of course there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels etc

25914 :  so as you walk around a church or a mosque or a cathedral what youre trying to imbibe what youre imbibing is through your

25915 :  now we dont think that way

25916 :  they dont think we need it

25917 :  first of all scale might

25918 :  essentially its propaganda

25919 :  why dont we

25920 :  there have been some very vocal atheists whove pointed out not just that religion is

25921 :  perhaps this is just me maybe you

25922 :  and for me atheism two
25923 :  we associate repetition with boredom

25924 :  and that has all sorts of advantages

25925 :  you wont do that by accident you will do that because you are guided to do that

25926 :  it sets things into perspective etc

25927 :  and thats what art is

25928 :  and the moon and the reflection on the moon will have a secure place in your heart

25929 :  the other things that religions do is to arrange time

25930 :  art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society

25931 :  if you said to a modern liberal individualist hey how about a sermon

25932 :  art should be didactic

25933 :  nonsense says the religious world view

25934 :  youve heard that saying

25935 :  and i think thats what the religious wars of late have ignored

25936 :  and they dont really change much

25937 :  now the word propaganda sets off alarm bells

25938 :  so religions are cultures of repetition

25939 :  ill just come across it

25940 :  i think there is an alternative

25941 :  and i go no

25942 :  i dont think we have to make that choice

25943 :  we think of hitler we think of stalin

25944 :  and secondly its trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate

25945 :  so in orthodox jewish communities every friday you go to a mikveh

25946 :  now art is something that in the secular world we think very highly of

25947 :  they have no trouble telling us what art is about

25948 :  sit them in a classroom tell them about plato at the age of twenty send them out for a career in management consultancy for forty years

25949 :  theres so much we can absorb

25950 :  after every convincing point people will go amen amen amen

25951 :  now think about religions think about organized religions

25952 :  so for example take the jewish idea of forgiveness

25953 :  art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith

25954 :  a lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums etc

25955 :  ive sketched a sort of broad framework

25956 :  jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor

25957 :  lets look to the plays of shakespeare the dialogues of plato the novels of jane austen

25958 :  we recognize them in relation to corporations

25959 :  they group together they form institutions

25960 :  what do organized religions do

25961 :  and you would go amen amen amen

25962 :  i really like turning the pages of the old testament

25963 :  we have secularized badly i would argue

25964 :  not so if youre adopting a religious mindset

25965 :  and thats really the spirit of my talk

25966 :  and they say so arent you sort of religious

25967 :  i think its too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way

25968 :  theyre selling us shoes and cars

25969 :  they said culture

25970 :  they said where are people going to find the morality where are they going to find guidance and where are they going to find

25971 :  youll be handed rice cakes

25972 :  i dont need one of those

25973 :  and influential voices came up with one answer

25974 :  now i think thats a very beautiful idea and a very true idea

25975 :  whatever it may be you know the kind of thing im talking about people who are attracted to the

25976 :  they tell us to have a bath

25977 :  and i say of course

25978 :  and corporations are very like religions in many ways except theyre right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs

25979 :  art is about two things in all the major faiths

25980 :  whats the difference between a sermon and our modern secular mode of delivery the lecture

25981 :  and when they teach us a lesson they do it via the body

25982 :  were only just holding it together

25983 :  you know in the 18th century in the u

25984 :  were like the golden state warriors of entrepreneurs lg

25985 :  seventy percent success rate

25986 :  i had no role models absolutely none

25987 :  thats almost twice as many as we have today

25988 :  but best of all weve made a small dent a very small dent in the worldwide plastic

25989 :  so im now on a mission to help organizations solve their wicked problems by

25990 :  but todays generation we have the opportunity to actually be honest about who we are

25991 :  that was what you were going to do

25992 :  of lying immensively to your friends to your family and in many cases to yourself just

25993 :  i face facebook more than books face me hoping to book face to faces

25994 :  im holding my daughter over a skype conference call while shes crying in the crib in the next room

25995 :  but who am i to judge

25996 :  we placed high value on it

25997 :  i didnt even think i could make it to my 18th birthday

25998 :  and these two dont contradict each other

25999 :  ive analyzed the language of platitudes and now i find myself facing the

26000 :  and then i also asked

26001 :  another objection you sometimes hear to invest in early childhood programs is concern

26002 :  now those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions and the way they can

26003 :  its a somewhat more indirect way

26004 :  you sacrifice now for a return later

26005 :  they will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages

26006 :  they hand out all kinds of business tax breaks

26007 :  ive talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues a lot of legislators about these issues

26008 :  its not exactly a low cost proposition

26009 :  so when you look for example at metropolitan areas such as the boston area minneapolis st

26010 :  that is the notion of investment

26011 :  so were talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is

26012 :  when legislators and others think about economic development what they first of all think about are business tax

26013 :  and so theyll both under invest because everyones going to move out

26014 :  so clearly the productivity of firms in silicon valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at

26015 :  ive spent most of my career researching these programs

26016 :  so if you look at what it would cost if every state government

26017 :  she will not care about the arc of your brow the weight of your clutch

26018 :  were you fearful or fearsome

26019 :  what colored the walls of your regret

26020 :  tell her you were brave and always always in the company of courage mostly the days when you just had yourself

26021 :  tell her she was born as you were as your mothers before and the sisters beside them in the age of

26022 :  some of us bore children and some of us did not and none of us questioned whether that made us real or appropriate or

26023 :  remind them that the year has passed to be docile or small

26024 :  and are you a hero

26025 :  what did you do for women in the year it was time

26026 :  tell her the truth how you lived in spite of crooked odds

26027 :  say daughter i stood there with the moment drawn on my face like a dagger and flung it back at itself slicing

26028 :  some of us said for the first time that we were women took this oath of solidarity seriously

26029 :  she will not ask of your mentions

26030 :  we were trained to dodge to wait to cower and cover to wait

26031 :  we were told to be silent

26032 :  there were still laws for every way we used our privates while they pawed at the soft folds of us grabbed

26033 :  im essentially dropping a basic idea into a group into a community people start gravitating to

26034 :  there is nothing shameful about being a feminist

26035 :  i cant describe to you how quickly i wanted to dive into numbness get away from the

26036 :  and from these words that i could take shelter in i made entire pinterest boards and from those boards i

26037 :  i started to freak out

26038 :  my lab partner and i discussed this for about a year

26039 :  x rays tend to go through everything and gamma rays even more so

26040 :  reflecting gamma rays is something that we can t do right now

26041 :  wait a minute maybe there s a whole new set of particles out there that we haven t even seen

26042 :  they have to sleep under them every night

26043 :  and thats what happening now

26044 :  you know it doesnt really have any value to a family with malaria except that it helps prevent malaria

26045 :  so this poses a huge economic challenge because say you do come up with your great drug or your great vaccine how do you

26046 :  it takes infrastructure

26047 :  and i really hated the mosquitos for that

26048 :  we promise you that

26049 :  i could be free from my depression

26050 :  they offered me a seat next to them

26051 :  the first result was actually a wiki someone had created with every street of every town in eastern ukraine with

26052 :  some of you may have known people affected by the tragedy

26053 :  there was a vast amount of information being shared online

26054 :  when the joint investigation team interviewed me as a witness to ask about the work we were doing i

26055 :  some of you may have known them

26056 :  several hours later over eastern ukraine it was shot down

26057 :  we put in the name of the shop

26058 :  some of it was hidden some of it was quite easy to find

26059 :  we could track this convoy back to the base it came from the 53rd air defense brigade

26060 :  in fact on july 21st two thousand and fourteen they gave a press conference where they presented their own evidence of what

26061 :  one hundred and ninetythree dutch citizens died on that plane

26062 :  we searched for that address and came up with something very interesting

26063 :  this was taken around midday on july 17th two thousand and fourteen
26064 :  you see the yorubas are an ethnic group from the southwestern part of nigeria and i was always fascinated by these

26065 :  would you like to paint for my music video

26066 :  mama thats what i call my grandmother told me many stories about yoruba mythology

26067 :  why dont you draw like other people

26068 :  people stopped me in the street

26069 :  people featured me in magazines interviews

26070 :  why dont you draw landscapes or maybe you draw chairs or furniture or maybe even draw

26071 :  and then she told me that they were actually symbols from the yoruba mythology

26072 :  im sure youre guessing where im going now

26073 :  because hes not looking at what his wife is doing

26074 :  i dont know

26075 :  we know babies suffer from jealousy

26076 :  we forget how harsh his vision was

26077 :  its so mysterious and its so pervasive

26078 :  i talk about futures

26079 :  thats what were programmed to do

26080 :  he goes i love what you do

26081 :  about three seconds ago

26082 :  but there are companies

26083 :  thats my simple understanding of human rights

26084 :  there are thousands of suppliers in there

26085 :  regular blood flow is called laminar which means streamlined no bumps straight path

26086 :  here is the thing

26087 :  how about one hundred people

26088 :  what if schools could play with it and actually change the code on it

26089 :  how about thirty people

26090 :  the second one is be active

26091 :  they are the happiest place

26092 :  and they have that latin vibe dont they

26093 :  we all need to love and be loved in life

26094 :  maybe some parts of the world dont but we have enough

26095 :  what would that look like for society

26096 :  hed be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon

26097 :  pave them with the five ways

26098 :  we have focused on the worst case scenario

26099 :  maybe this was some kind of cliche that had never been taxonomized before

26100 :  i found a couple in the work of matt groening although matt groening told me later that he could not make my talk because it was a morning

26101 :  there are a couple three in the mornings in shakespeare

26102 :  they played along

26103 :  but they followed the pattern

26104 :  i remember bringing them all to my favorite corner table and i read poems paired

26105 :  much of it was content i never would have found on my own if i was looking for it and i was not

26106 :  theres a five in the morning

26107 :  maybe i was on the trail of a new meme or something

26108 :  secondly i did a little research

26109 :  com launched later that year with a bunch of videos from past talks including mine and i started receiving four in the

26110 :  and actually we know that those cells in the body in the embryo as they develop can form a different kind of

26111 :  but we want to make them have enough information that we can get the cells to do what we want but not be so

26112 :  were actually actively looking for materials that will be bioactive that will interact with the body and that

26113 :  one of my favorite examples is that of sir harold ridley who was a

26114 :  whatever life throws at us whether its cancer diabetes heart disease or even broken bones we

26115 :  theyve taken things off the shelf

26116 :  but it doesnt manifest it in quite the same way

26117 :  thats how they met

26118 :  so what are you going to do with your life

26119 :  i will pay i will pay because for everyone because i know that next time someone else will

26120 :  this is something i couldnt do before

26121 :  you can count them on your hands

26122 :  that means that when i remembered words i started to remember how they looked on the page

26123 :  basically in my heart im thinking of a person ive missed this person

26124 :  but in china theres a sentence theres a phrase its pinyin

26125 :  lets take an example in the 60s a chinese research team developed a

26126 :  but actually if we start thinking about the way love is lived and perceived by individuals

26127 :  ive actually witnessed this with a middle aged couple and they didnt speak to each other after they got angry with each

26128 :  i started to get a photographic memory

26129 :  now you may think this is of no interest and its like banal but actually it inscribes the

26130 :  so the sentence goes something like this

26131 :  this is relevant because our idea of romantic love is actually the opposite its something which is special in the

26132 :  allow me to explain

26133 :  its time to re connect with water

26134 :  too messy too unpredictable too constraining for your taste

26135 :  in early february two thousand and fourteen a few weeks before russia would invade crimea a phone call is posted

26136 :  democracy in all its trappings free elections town halls endless debates about

26137 :  and i look at her and i say wow

26138 :  a conversation is an adventure

26139 :  what did you think of it

26140 :  i think ive heard that somewhere

26141 :  the grocery guy the cab guy maybe the receptionist at a new office you went to

26142 :  they can all be wrong

26143 :  and he called it hypothesis free science

26144 :  i mean look at the elephant

26145 :  yeah well we dont talk about that

26146 :  ill go ahead with that

26147 :  its what we ought to be doing

26148 :  everybody knew the answer

26149 :  why should it be there

26150 :  that crazy woman

26151 :  sir david attenborough hes come over

26152 :  hes come over

26153 :  it was wrong

26154 :  some of them have come over

26155 :  now fifty years ago that was a laughably simple question

26156 :  there was professor tobias

26157 :  its available twentyfour seven for free and professional counselors are happy to hook people up with the services they

26158 :  so we ring up bangladesh and say hey whatever you paid for the funeral please let us know well provide you with that as well as a

26159 :  that you can be anything you want to be you can be whoever you want to be because you dont have any value

26160 :  its the same thing in bangladesh

26161 :  i tell these stories not to make you sad so i hope as the first speaker this doesnt get you down for the rest of

26162 :  i hope you think about that for the rest of the day

26163 :  they had never heard that before

26164 :  walking through land that used to have villages on it

26165 :  now lets see if we can pay for the funeral

26166 :  and i got the call that he passed away

26167 :  thats a tough reality

26168 :  thats really hard to deal with

26169 :  in september two thousand and seven i went to bangladesh working with habitat for humanity

26170 :  why was he just laying on the table

26171 :  we can take action

26172 :  and it just goes to show you how wide our spectrum is for autism its just how many people are doing

26173 :  early intervention is the key for these kids

26174 :  one of the best supports that came to me was when i was able to go out of district

26175 :  its like how how is this possible

26176 :  and one of my earliest dreams was to get to college

26177 :  i went to public school from 1st to 4th grade and then from 5th to high

26178 :  when i was able to go out of district i was able to for the first time really get the supports i needed the

26179 :  so when i got to college i became an advocate

26180 :  autism doesnt define my life

26181 :  i didnt have many aspirations as a kid because of the amount of services i had to

26182 :  i define autism

26183 :  but scientists should surely be precautionary about experiments that generate conditions without

26184 :  we know that diabetes is on the rise

26185 :  basically rice butter and sugar

26186 :  all in this amazing little pills

26187 :  mom and i embarked on a whole bunch of diets

26188 :  unfortunately it was full of refined starch lots of added sugars additives and preservatives and whatever else

26189 :  we were both ill by about day three in bed so we decided

26190 :  im not here to talk about body image thats a whole other talk

26191 :  more than a decade ago now actually i think

26192 :  so let s take butter as an example

26193 :  but diet really just means the way that we eat and what we are eating

26194 :  and here s what happened

26195 :  so here s what i ve seen happen

26196 :  it s only when you change for the long term you change the way your thought processes work that s

26197 :  now thats not an aesthetic problem

26198 :  rush rush rush

26199 :  that s actually what the research showed

26200 :  then we tried something else called the scarsdale diet that involved eating a dry piece of wholemeal toast in the morning with

26201 :  really solid evidence behind that kind of a diet

26202 :  and i hope you ll agree with me that that is an idea worth spreading

26203 :  everything is on the run

26204 :  you re lucky if you grab a sandwich on the way

26205 :  that study showed that the americans were much more concerned and worried about the foods that they buy they were much more

26206 :  everything is grabbing on the run

26207 :  go back to eating lots of fat

26208 :  no it didn t say that but that s the media reporting

26209 :  but at school we had to say grace before we ate our lunch

26210 :  we absolutely must eat more plant food

26211 :  and i think thats one of the reasons why we dont think its practical because we havent made it an achievable

26212 :  sounds like something we see on those greeting cards once a year

26213 :  she looked at me and she said at first i think you are bad

26214 :  i hadnt seen her before

26215 :  we think of it as something for the nelson mandelas and the mother teresas of the world but we dont

26216 :  i asked her the question i asked everyone

26217 :  and these kids i just loved them

26218 :  seven and he wrote twelve of them in total

26219 :  they accept that it actually probably isnt and do it anyway

26220 :  second to embody

26221 :  and these people that i was working with was variously consumed with two terms

26222 :  they want to im sure like many of you help the world do something to help people

26223 :  a number of my clients come to me and theyre looking externally for a vision

26224 :  what they wanted to create in the world

26225 :  and it has a two fold meaning

26226 :  explore that new idea you had

26227 :  another problem also existed

26228 :  so to have the idea truly work out not only did i have to gather the permission of my parents to go and work in another city but

26229 :  i received an email from a professor of harvard medical school who told me that if i sent recommendation letters and my

26230 :  sure i had no personal contacts but after browsing through tons of articles online i realized that

26231 :  go to that new restaurant

26232 :  instead of government we think of anarchy

26233 :  some said no nicely some ignored my email

26234 :  what would madiba do

26235 :  and i often would say to myself even in my darkest hour

26236 :  once we accept this reality well realize how crucial it is that we continue to explore ways

26237 :  but the trouble is you only have three and if you give up all three reminder sticks you have to sit out

26238 :  so why is this

26239 :  i read a study that asked little children what worries them most

26240 :  hes one of my favorite people

26241 :  hes served several tours in afghanistan

26242 :  is jack worried about being hit

26243 :  that i would let people like you hear her story and so this morning im going to honor that promise and im going to

26244 :  he told me he wouldnt leave the fields unless his parents came with him

26245 :  but what if you had no voice

26246 :  they always kept fighting

26247 :  enter detroit vegan soul

26248 :  they never gave up

26249 :  five million dollars and they provided two hundred and fiftytwo jobs

26250 :  they held on to hope

26251 :  no im going to take that back

26252 :  so we party and dance to their music

26253 :  i thought i was famous enough that i would raise the money within one month but ive been humbled

26254 :  but who is to be blamed

26255 :  i was ready to eat

26256 :  one of them happened to be me now

26257 :  they will die soon

26258 :  i know its a shame

26259 :  i wanted to revenge for my village

26260 :  so these same women now have a little business

26261 :  so what i was doing it was like a blessing in disguise

26262 :  ive been waiting for this call for twenty years

26263 :  i would have paid to do this project

26264 :  the most important of all will we disappoint these people

26265 :  have you been to a museum to see how people used to be

26266 :  can you be heard

26267 :  this is a brave new world

26268 :  go out of here you are in a baroque or renaissance city

26269 :  people found new ways to use old buildings

26270 :  and how do we learn to empathize

26271 :  because hes jolly much better than the champ we have

26272 :  and if you go out here into cracow you will see churches that are identical to churches youll

26273 :  there are still great grandparents alive of school children today who could be interviewing making

26274 :  to add to we should have photographs we should have competitions for how to save the house what

26275 :  thats not really the way to get into peoples minds is it

26276 :  there are women out there having to cover themselves up because of traditions and

26277 :  thats when i started to see my elements clearly

26278 :  we need to have ambition then we need to see what are the

26279 :  i lost all hope

26280 :  down you go

26281 :  a man came into the aquarium

26282 :  maybe i can do this all the time

26283 :  and then i realize the octopus won the arms race lg

26284 :  then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors just pulsing all of these colors

26285 :  and what i learned in school though was really beneficial

26286 :  yeah ill be a filmmaker

26287 :  and i applaud that

26288 :  indeed its the only thing that ever has

26289 :  and the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays and being the spineless guy i

26290 :  ive been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay

26291 :  it was all i could do to hold onto this amazing creature

26292 :  i think margaret mead said it best

26293 :  but what were exposing ourselves to every day now is very much interfering with

26294 :  you should be for thirty to sixty minutes outside in bright light so put some sunscreen on and go

26295 :  the flip side of this is that when you come home at night i would dare guess that pretty

26296 :  but we should also think about what is this doing to our health if were flooding ourselves with this

26297 :  it turned out la had just suffered a major earthquake which resulted in citywide blackouts

26298 :  two people in my lab

26299 :  and were not in tune with the natural light and dark cycles right

26300 :  in fact what they were seeing was not a trail from some alien spaceship but

26301 :  and in particular whats really bad is that these devices are very very rich in blue light

26302 :  they wondered if they should be worried

26303 :  it doesnt drive electric

26304 :  its more than that

26305 :  year on year these products get better and better and better

26306 :  thats highly disruptive

26307 :  its not just an electric car

26308 :  and i can download apps on it

26309 :  and that will never grow

26310 :  and i say well yeah but its heavily subsidized

26311 :  its becoming an electric appliance

26312 :  thats why you want it

26313 :  well thats gonna change

26314 :  they will charge faster

26315 :  he says yeah this car it just accelerates like hell

26316 :  in one or two years you got a serious market share

26317 :  and thats what im talking about today

26318 :  you might be able to look at brain activity and say this persons going to be a good poker player or this persons socially naive and we might also

26319 :  they play lots of trials with different amounts each time

26320 :  this experiments been done many many times

26321 :  some of these will sound familiar because you probably are thinking that way

26322 :  theyre interested in working memory

26323 :  this goes back quite a ways

26324 :  its something that ive worked on and a few other people and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many

26325 :  your intuition might tell you that too

26326 :  i got two hundred in the first two weeks

26327 :  i said if you wish to

26328 :  and just one last thing

26329 :  and i went away

26330 :  i said i havent the foggiest idea

26331 :  its about letting it happen

26332 :  and they said something very interesting to me

26333 :  i went three hundred miles out of delhi into a really remote village where the chances of a passing software

26334 :  so by now i had developed a new pedagogical method so i applied that

26335 :  i found a village

26336 :  it was three feet off the ground and they said what is this

26337 :  theres a great document produced by ted which tells you how to do it

26338 :  where does it stop

26339 :  but how will we know

26340 :  im not saying theyre broken

26341 :  everythings done from the cloud

26342 :  how will we come to know

26343 :  the lights are turned on and off by the cloud etc

26344 :  thats my wish

26345 :  theyll get a zero

26346 :  we had a good conversation about that

26347 :  math makes sense of the world

26348 :  how long will it take you to fill it up

26349 :  im sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that

26350 :  everyones filled something up with water before so i get kids answering the question how long will it take

26351 :  math is the vocabulary for your own intuition

26352 :  and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a b c and d labels to talk about them more easily

26353 :  and ask yourself what problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given

26354 :  find out what you can do more within your neighborhood

26355 :  and i am happy with the positive change i see

26356 :  and often we opt to just not go to the bathroom at all

26357 :  oh now im looking at his crotch

26358 :  its a blast

26359 :  ok ok lets stop those hypothetical questions before we get too close for my comfort

26360 :  being trans is awkward because everyone else gets awkward when theyre around me

26361 :  how does he have sex

26362 :  then i would go to my practice my second practice i would come home at nine oclock at night go straight to

26363 :  maybe it would work

26364 :  you are we all are

26365 :  that i probably would not learn how to speak or hear very well but i wanted to try

26366 :  i have two younger deaf brothers who are the same way

26367 :  i want to start off with a question

26368 :  people are uncomfortable when they see new things and i think its our job as

26369 :  most of the time its because theyre scared or they dont understand

26370 :  and i saw the results

26371 :  i have two now by the way i forgot to mention

26372 :  i said oh im from new york

26373 :  which brings me to my idea

26374 :  its the same principle

26375 :  this is slightly newer

26376 :  it looks like the kind of thing we do

26377 :  but we cant force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second

26378 :  this is its stomach

26379 :  just spread them around

26380 :  that changes the way in which we use robots

26381 :  we have to pretend

26382 :  and you can make artificial muscles out of jelly

26383 :  thats from forty fifty years ago

26384 :  can you do this

26385 :  our current robots dont really do that

26386 :  you can make robots which are biodegradable

26387 :  but i believe that orcas dont belong in captivity because this destroys family

26388 :  id never really memorialized myself

26389 :  but id never done anything about myself

26390 :  people are better than you think and theyll surprise you

26391 :  maybe you dont approve of the solutions theyve come up with maybe you think you wouldve done it a different way but they think theyre doing the

26392 :  the guys i talked to were not racists but they were trying to reclaim a racist symbol

26393 :  im not asking you to be tolerant of each other

26394 :  were going to have to do it ourselves because ill tell you what you know what one thing is that most of us agree on

26395 :  tolerance is for cowards

26396 :  and one in five would be unhappy if someone from the other political party married into our

26397 :  i have exits and entrances

26398 :  i put that mask on so very tight and yeah i got into a lot of fights

26399 :  its been a real pleasure to be able to share my story

26400 :  hes feeling pretty awesome today

26401 :  why this fear of autism

26402 :  acceptance is proactive

26403 :  we had a nice house

26404 :  at ten his father dies

26405 :  i said its nine minutes

26406 :  at nine his mother dies

26407 :  but over the centuries we have constructed on top of this objective

26408 :  and much of the political and social history of the last two hundred years involved what to do with

26409 :  you could never do it with chimpanzees

26410 :  what kind of chimpanzee are you

26411 :  in most tasks and will make humans redundant

26412 :  what exactly are these things

26413 :  there is basically just one way in which a beehive can function

26414 :  i was told firsthand what caused me to behave the way i did before i could lucid dream

26415 :  i know that alley

26416 :  he is dancing with his shirt off in a city that i have never been to click

26417 :  and peirce pointed out that actually this is one of the shakiest most fragile most tenuous forms of logical inference that you

26418 :  to me actually its highly meaningful

26419 :  and we then have to imagine what could have caused those

26420 :  thats all we can know of it directly

26421 :  perception is an active process

26422 :  the reason its meaningful to me is i have prior expectations and prior knowledge

26423 :  everything else is logical inference

26424 :  messages in verbal and visual and even telepathic forms that were highly critical of him very unpleasant

26425 :  its an expression of love

26426 :  but every other medium does it

26427 :  the ships start in england they come down from england they go to africa they go across the ocean thats the middle passage part they come to america

26428 :  he just couldnt capture the picture

26429 :  but these are really high performance athletic animals

26430 :  first just a little bit about me

26431 :  mg i think to an extent you have to understand that its axiomatic among hackers that they do

26432 :  and let me be blunt about this

26433 :  one of the smartest people ive ever met

26434 :  and he explained to me how in two thousand and three and two thousand and four he would go on sprees in new

26435 :  at his open prison he came under the influence of financial fraudsters and those financial

26436 :  it undermines our fixed truths and what we believe to be our culture and their culture

26437 :  it was a member of this same hindu fundamentalist movement who shot dead mahatma

26438 :  ah youre a kenyan asian

26439 :  then they got me mapped

26440 :  it promotes engagement and collaboration

26441 :  it makes you more productive and task focused

26442 :  we have the ability to work almost anywhere at any time

26443 :  i dream of it

26444 :  i believe its possible

26445 :  remaking it would mean two things

26446 :  and so that spirit lives on

26447 :  it takes a short time to ruin love

26448 :  now of course theres other ways to deal with that

26449 :  but basically you can take a cellphone or a tablet or a headset and move around three dimensional

26450 :  i never needed biology to form family anyway

26451 :  the questions began to feel interrogative

26452 :  stopping cues were everywhere in the 20th century

26453 :  now of course screens are miraculous in a lot of ways

26454 :  you really connect with the people who are there with you

26455 :  one thing you can do is ask yourself what goes on during that time

26456 :  so theres a lot of good that comes from them

26457 :  at daimler the german car company theyve got another great strategy

26458 :  there were stopping cues everywhere

26459 :  we get some of that from work as well but when people look back on their lives and wonder what their lives have been like at the

26460 :  and think about newspapers eventually you get to the end you fold the newspaper away you put it aside

26461 :  because were really bad at resisting temptation

26462 :  we like certain things

26463 :  and the second thing of course is the moment you are getting married

26464 :  remember the double income no kids

26465 :  so no surprise that a new industry developed in our country

26466 :  we ask the easy and very profound question

26467 :  before that we basically e

26468 :  television is always ranked number one

26469 :  what do you mean

26470 :  only one out of five germans would like to watch more tv

26471 :  we are doing so many things

26472 :  the best ager the golden ager we are all aware of them

26473 :  apart from that there was the decade of the baby boomers

26474 :  with sex its the other way around

26475 :  you have like this virtual umbilical cord to stay in contact with your family with your friends even with

26476 :  and when i tell them

26477 :  the moment you start working you do not have the time to be online all the time

26478 :  its always interesting when i ask my students at university

26479 :  most of them look at me and say

26480 :  but back to my topic

26481 :  take for example television

26482 :  now the problem is not that do not have access

26483 :  so forty more users within a very short period of time

26484 :  only twentyfour would like to use the internet more often

26485 :  but if you only have a low education only one out of three has the chance to go online

26486 :  so how about the present

26487 :  im not sure

26488 :  how will the future look like

26489 :  the future of leisure time

26490 :  having more time for the family more time for their friends more time for their team mates for their neighbors

26491 :  and that is where the research began

26492 :  but that was me years ago

26493 :  and i remember watching my family go through that and thinking that i never wanted another family to feel

26494 :  it was about finding my passion

26495 :  with this question in mind i started researching and i soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit

26496 :  is it worth it to you

26497 :  and later in biology class i learned that its due to a process called denaturing which is where the proteins will change

26498 :  and then went on my next summer to work under dr

26499 :  got rejected by all except one

26500 :  so thats what we set out to do

26501 :  its a huge problem

26502 :  based on these findings i have a question for you

26503 :  because remember we spend ninety percent of our lives indoors

26504 :  sounds great right

26505 :  because i realized that if we could find a way to target remediation we could also find a way to

26506 :  and i was led to it through a series of events

26507 :  but before i end my talk today i want to leave you with one saying

26508 :  for example volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools homes and

26509 :  but i want everyone here to reimagine a world where instead of prescribing steroids inhalers and

26510 :  and this time they no longer respond to the drug

26511 :  sf also gives shape and form to people

26512 :  thats where the discoveries are made

26513 :  im fine with my insulin

26514 :  he died of these complications at the age of fifty
26515 :  weve never let them go weve packed them up weve saved them up weve transported them weve written then around but weve

26516 :  he has no choice

26517 :  watching my beautiful hair circle the bath tube drain in the shower before it disappeared from sight was gut

26518 :  i wanted a relationship with them built on safety

26519 :  but if we see tony stark reaching out to his friends asking for help fighting for his life or fighting for what he believes

26520 :  they save the day

26521 :  theres science behind this too

26522 :  theyre not just entertainment

26523 :  its stories like these i want to see more of in the comics that were reading and in the movies that were watching

26524 :  but i go see superhero movies for explosions and hot dudes in tights

26525 :  when kids or twentyone year old college women are watching comic book movies and looking for what

26526 :  talking with him is the second key point

26527 :  their calm down system in their brain doesnt begin to come on line until

26528 :  its getting more systematic

26529 :  so potentially with this new lever that we have with the nanopatch we can help make that happen

26530 :  and the who has figures that suggest about one
26531 :  it has to happen in close collaboration with biologists

26532 :  a friend once asked me she said so when do you think this women driving will happen

26533 :  so for me it wasnt only about these attacks i had to face

26534 :  i learned to be always there

26535 :  we are minors until the day we die

26536 :  he broke the good bad news in my face

26537 :  its about women themselves

26538 :  one of them is when i was in jail

26539 :  but there is no law banning you from driving

26540 :  i told her only if women stop asking when

26541 :  two boys hit me today in school

26542 :  and take action to make it now

26543 :  thank you very much

26544 :  weve mapped and weve charted and weve captured our histories in ways that are the

26545 :  sundiata keita was born about one thousand two hundred and thirtyfive growing up in a time of profound

26546 :  and one went as far as to posit i do not think that i am far wrong if i

26547 :  and although they werent always successful many of the most important manuscripts were thankfully

26548 :  and at its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries the university there was

26549 :  they knew that controlling territory and subjugating the head of state it wasnt enough

26550 :  these were communities whove grown up with stories of the mali empire lived in the shadow of

26551 :  we owe it to our children and grandchildren

26552 :  its changes will affect all of humanity

26553 :  everybody used them

26554 :  we really dont give them the chance

26555 :  we have nestl creating nespresso we have lego going into animated films

26556 :  but we dont only see this in companies

26557 :  the company was brilliant

26558 :  the whole point is for hope right

26559 :  what did i see to be except myself

26560 :  another knuckle is looking to crack into my daughters skin

26561 :  and now i find myself writing all these poems as advice to my future self upon being a

26562 :  my one hand holding tight my other

26563 :  dont tell me its wrong to want to raise a child from this kind of fear

26564 :  a part of me is really trying to work toward obsolescence

26565 :  then came the movies

26566 :  you start people for the american way

26567 :  you had no training as a writer formally but you hustled your way in

26568 :  forty the next day forty minutes later at nine
26569 :  our job the job of this team of which im a part of is to send commands to the rover

26570 :  eventually well move to a modified mars time which is what were working now

26571 :  and so she sleeps

26572 :  wait what time is it in california

26573 :  and that was because again this eventually becomes hard

26574 :  will i wake them up

26575 :  so our day is twentyfour hours

26576 :  and these rovers are our robotic emissaries

26577 :  so one day you come in at eight
26578 :  this team needs to be at work at five
26579 :  what time is it on mars

26580 :  yeah not so much

26581 :  so we learn how to operate on other planets through these rovers

26582 :  so those of us who were on mars time would refer to ourselves as martians and

26583 :  twenty the next day at ten
26584 :  and they were on dads work schedule

26585 :  is it ok to call

26586 :  zero in the morning

26587 :  so they lived on mars time for a month and had these great adventures like going bowling in the middle of the night

26588 :  and why are you at my restaurant at three
26589 :  so you can imagine how confusing that is

26590 :  and they had about thirty of us that they would do sleep deprivation experiments on

26591 :  it was a huge bonding experience with the other members on the team but it is

26592 :  might make it my new years resolution

26593 :  hows that working out

26594 :  you said that last week

26595 :  they dont have to be conventional dont limit them to solely careers or jobs but just remember that if

26596 :  one of my favorite quotes from walt disney

26597 :  the best things in life stem from ideas right

26598 :  it was during this topic that i realized that i need to stop worrying about how im affected and start taking into account

26599 :  in order to empathetic you understand the situation that you havent been through but when you are sympathetic you try to make that

26600 :  we had no prior knowledge of this ism so once we learned about ableism we realized that were a lot of things which we do

26601 :  i realize that consumers are getting smarter and they were looking for good products that would make them

26602 :  everyones rushing to get somewhere and do something and pushing other people out of the way

26603 :  the people around you will be happier as well

26604 :  ive looked for it in the form of men on white horses carrying armour and things like that

26605 :  be impatient with yourself and dont settle

26606 :  youre fighting a battle against your brain and youre not going to win

26607 :  but im still thinking probably a trapped nerve or a carpal tunnel at worst

26608 :  coming out not only makes our lives transparent and allows us to

26609 :  you have already achieved a majority in the northern ireland assembly

26610 :  judge margaret h

26611 :  openness generates public activism and public activism generates political

26612 :  the real issue is fear

26613 :  and jesse soto has grit and the ability by using his voice to change how

26614 :  every twentysix seconds someone drops out of high school

26615 :  so we get on the jet i board the jet we have a nice dinner

26616 :  i know i am

26617 :  increasingly for the right reasons i focus with organizations on

26618 :  i think its something we need it think about

26619 :  to love what theyre doing

26620 :  i normally focus on numbers

26621 :  you see all these chief titles this is a representation of that

26622 :  i was seven years old

26623 :  we have all our communication devices right

26624 :  and to be honest i mean this is a business icon a fortune ten ceo

26625 :  you want to move up in business

26626 :  lets break it down

26627 :  and i offer this for your consideration

26628 :  i think this is a really good thing

26629 :  ill tell you what she served me

26630 :  and that led to a bunch of other thoughts

26631 :  thats a great place to be

26632 :  and the real question is

26633 :  the triple bottom line

26634 :  she was an inspiration

26635 :  thats a great place to be

26636 :  i remember melissas patience waiting her turn

26637 :  i focus on numbers

26638 :  for twenty years and id done okay but i was waiting always for somebody else to tell me is it time for that next i didnt want to

26639 :  but its about numbers

26640 :  and like i said i was fascinated with the moon the night sky but i was actually

26641 :  the same song can affect different people in different ways

26642 :  thank you very much

26643 :  when i was twentyone i was able to go and study with the great spanish master andr s segovia in

26644 :  i was transported

26645 :  there are a few places in the world are really good at keeping them alive

26646 :  its just not possible

26647 :  and computer networking which spawned companies like three com and cisco and made the internet possible

26648 :  and you see this today

26649 :  and companies know this

26650 :  do they need an alarm clock to wake up

26651 :  we dont prioritize it

26652 :  we follow the planting cycles

26653 :  when i was younger i worked out in colorado

26654 :  they represent our safety and the safety of all our loved ones

26655 :  this is mainly because it is required that every state sends this fatal crash information to the federal

26656 :  fifty three courses or for twentyseven
26657 :  so we came up with the idea to start a pop up place

26658 :  if it doesnt matter to you who i sleep with then you cannot imagine what it feels like when i walk down the

26659 :  our moral integrity is our responsibility and we must be prepared to defend it even when its

26660 :  which one was more important

26661 :  that line actually went the other way

26662 :  and as we walk in it is a scene i can only describe you as saying it looked like norway throw up

26663 :  its ok to remember to forget or forget to remember what happened

26664 :  give them a round of applause as they go back to their seats

26665 :  do you understand

26666 :  she could also read the serial numbers on bills when they were placed face down on a hard surface

26667 :  i need two people to help me out real quick

26668 :  he wasnt really sure where that all came from and what it meant and i had to convince him and a lot of

26669 :  my school had to do something about it

26670 :  and i also said to him look jack your schools in london

26671 :  so i rather cheekily created a role for myself

26672 :  do a bit of research and maybe youll come up with the answer

26673 :  i would visit lots of schools and i would be inspired by the different ideas that young

26674 :  i knew that my school had to mark this

26675 :  well youve got to tell someone

26676 :  now my head teacher wasnt so convinced about this

26677 :  and if we can get young people doing good stuff in their school then theyre much more likely to go out into their community

26678 :  student anti bullying coordinator

26679 :  i suppose it was all about making these young people mini celebrities in their school

26680 :  but maybe they could see how many other passionate people there are in schools in communities in work places that have

26681 :  im sure weve all heard that

26682 :  but eventually he said to me

26683 :  i wanted to create a tv advert

26684 :  and i can remember going home in tears quite often

26685 :  how about you come to it

26686 :  and i think thats where community begins thats where we get our sense of what it means to be a community where we can

26687 :  and this is it

26688 :  i wanted every single citizen to know that they should be an active citizen one that doesnt stand

26689 :  i wanted everyone to know that they could play a part in tackling bullying

26690 :  and if youre sitting there or watching this thinking whats the big society

26691 :  what am i going to achieve in those three years that i cant achieve now

26692 :  but i think whatever happens im going to continue doing what im doing because im passionate about that

26693 :  i didnt hear from jack after that

26694 :  every single one of us can do something for someone else

26695 :  all of them were limited to fifty one hundred or five hundred schools

26696 :  because it really allowed us to take all those ideas which were being thrown at us and say which ones we were going to

26697 :  does this idea support this goal

26698 :  as my colleagues and i looked across the country and across the world we couldnt find another example that

26699 :  ive tried a number of things and nothing seems to work

26700 :  but what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled

26701 :  has the toilet been made has the meal been served

26702 :  but now imagine that the head of this ngo goes to the head of the school education department and says hey now

26703 :  the department used to have a process which is very interesting

26704 :  can you possibly help

26705 :  and even for me whos lived in india all her life walking into one of these schools is fairly

26706 :  by the time kids are thirteen or fourteen they tend to drop out of schools

26707 :  in the end i think we did find solutions to many of the issues

26708 :  radical amounts of autonomy

26709 :  its built much more around intrinsic motivation

26710 :  work on anything you want

26711 :  thats not how its supposed to work right

26712 :  it takes children a long time to break into the system

26713 :  i need a drink with my lunch

26714 :  one is that you cant be tmsed without knowing it

26715 :  so its not a surreptitious technology

26716 :  so this brain region is called the right tpj

26717 :  so first the first thing i want to tell you is that there is a brain region in the human brain in your brains whose

26718 :  but the powder is labeled deadly poison so grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison

26719 :  rs thats exactly right

26720 :  its getting them wrong that is living

26721 :  this system takes a long time to develop slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence

26722 :  this is a picture of it

26723 :  and so i think of what im doing not so much as studying the defendant in a criminal trial but studying the jury

26724 :  this is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse through somebodys skull into a small region of their brain

26725 :  its quite hard actually to get those very small changes

26726 :  and that problem is how is it so easy to know other minds

26727 :  we changed their ability to judge other peoples actions

26728 :  the changes i showed you are impressive to me because of what they tell us about the function of the brain but theyre small

26729 :  and we can use that same pulse now applied to the rtpj to ask if we can change peoples moral

26730 :  we can tell the distance we can tell that when they collided they merged to form a new black hole about

26731 :  one said to me our people used to gather in cafes to watch football or soccer

26732 :  the less i liked math and science the more i liked history and literature

26733 :  and that theres a necessity to be good at those to be smart

26734 :  thats the problem

26735 :  we can refuel this very quickly just by putting more fuel into it and the device is unchanged

26736 :  it didnt work all that well

26737 :  it would make a lot of sense

26738 :  maybe these people are right

26739 :  everyone brings a unique personality and theyre dying for you to notice it

26740 :  because very likely its more about you than about someone else

26741 :  why is this happening

26742 :  whats going on

26743 :  if youre irritated by something someone else is doing pause and reflect on why

26744 :  and then just days after that i got my steps in today for my baby norm

26745 :  eightytwo percent of black women are over a healthy weight right now

26746 :  thats every eleven minutes

26747 :  but i have to tell you the statistics

26748 :  im shaking a little bit

26749 :  why is whats out there not working for them

26750 :  we asked ourselves that same question

26751 :  vanessa and i were in fort lauderdale

26752 :  let me grab some supplies

26753 :  but were going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary and

26754 :  so we studied models like wangari maathai who won the nobel peace prize for inspiring women to plant fifty million trees in

26755 :  the question hurts me

26756 :  the present self does not want to save at all

26757 :  its in control

26758 :  because its not that easy to get rid of five dollars

26759 :  i mean lets face it the present self is present

26760 :  now saving is a classic two selves problem

26761 :  im talking about the topic of saving

26762 :  its physically possible to exercise more

26763 :  it wants to consume

26764 :  and no matter what i say you cannot untie me from the mast

26765 :  i can im confident

26766 :  theres no magic button

26767 :  put your hand up

26768 :  really not true

26769 :  after six or seven im like

26770 :  about all the things that make me who i am

26771 :  if women are equal now then to talk about sexism to complain about sexism must be overreacting

26772 :  why was this so normal

26773 :  women are equal now more or less

26774 :  but whats the point to being so conspicuous

26775 :  i just traveled from a to b and i came there without a passport

26776 :  and interfere with our god given right to move around as free human beings

26777 :  and none of that was expected of me

26778 :  it always prevails

26779 :  so aim to be on the side of the truth

26780 :  so the concept that heart fat causes heart disease is completely bogus

26781 :  and they wanted to talk to james on their facebook page

26782 :  mime and drama are my favorite art forms

26783 :  and one of them is movement and mime like i just showed you

26784 :  i thought that would be my father except i noticed the creature had long hair

26785 :  our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work they should be able to

26786 :  so they found some boys hanging out on the street talked with them

26787 :  it usually takes three four or five months

26788 :  and their mission was to make jamilas company the most investable company it could be by the end of that

26789 :  and it would be more stable for me

26790 :  but you know actually there is a problem

26791 :  because of that it takes a long time

26792 :  but if you were to sit down and start building that day not only would you start having your plans

26793 :  that would provide a steady stream of income

26794 :  not only did they do it one time every one of the entrepreneurs had four sessions like this

26795 :  that would double my income

26796 :  and he said thats amazing

26797 :  so if you ask a friend for maybe one hundred dollars not a big deal

26798 :  what it means to truly serve a community

26799 :  and they were kind of interested in carpentry they might pay ten pesos for a lesson in carpentry but

26800 :  i dont have a lot of extra cars and motorcycles for them to work on

26801 :  thats why it takes months to do actually

26802 :  they werent serial entrepreneurs

26803 :  i dont even know i can really teach this class

26804 :  not in an arbitrary way in a way that became so real that at the end of three hours we

26805 :  what it means to truly create value by people interacting with each other

26806 :  now we need to find a mechanic so they called their 1st away team and found a mechanic in town

26807 :  and so we allowed multinationals into india

26808 :  were also asking what does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around

26809 :  well yes absolutely it can

26810 :  its just raw material

26811 :  more than any other bit of technology the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the

26812 :  can we build a creative computer

26813 :  so thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online so we have results

26814 :  so in two thousand and thirteen my friend benjamin laird and i we created a turing test for poetry online

26815 :  so my first insight is that for some reason we associate poetry with being

26816 :  so were going to have to try a different approach

26817 :  we show it gertrude stein what we get back is gertrude stein

26818 :  what is a computer

26819 :  it simply means that the category of the human is unstable

26820 :  how do we say who or what can be part of this category

26821 :  what we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human like computer

26822 :  it was much harder

26823 :  i also believe that alan turing understood this and that when he devised his test back in one thousand nine hundred and fifty
26824 :  but what weve seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact that its an ever shifting

26825 :  but we should also be asking ourselves what idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us

26826 :  so my final insight is that the computer more or less works like a mirror that

26827 :  just seventytwo hours after his stroke he had already embraced the

26828 :  there was no audible voice but my father called out my name powerfully

26829 :  in the 21st century we face new challenges aging obesity climate

26830 :  gdp has defined and shaped our lives for the last eighty years

26831 :  its a good point well made

26832 :  markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up

26833 :  and it shouldnt be a guide to all decision making

26834 :  its an area the size of europe twentyfour million people one of the most deprived parts of the

26835 :  theres a lot of social progress bang for your gdp buck

26836 :  to face those challenges we need new tools of measurement new ways of valuing

26837 :  its not a measure of our well being

26838 :  imagine if we could measure what nonprofits charities volunteers civil

26839 :  we will say no you do not have a dad

26840 :  and thats the strange thing about advice

26841 :  they hoped that their children would understand their reasons for making the family in this way

26842 :  one couple explained their insemination by taking their children to a farm

26843 :  work with advice that works for your family

26844 :  we do tests we do follow up studies

26845 :  so it is diy

26846 :  can you tell me how you came into the family

26847 :  however rapid increases in computational power are putting at risk a number of the key

26848 :  except this time instead of a call to give james the code were going to use quantum effects

26849 :  a fun example but it does illustrate three things important for encryption

26850 :  i used to live in a place where the sound of mortars bullets jet fighters and missiles don t

26851 :  and personally i survived death more than ten times from mortars

26852 :  but i managed to achieve my target again a gpa of three
26853 :  i needed to learn how to write essays motivation letters personal statements filling applications all of these things

26854 :  im not going to waste my time any more on these things

26855 :  and i struggled to learn the language

26856 :  john stuart mill was particularly skeptical about the democratic process

26857 :  and indeed liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the

26858 :  and imagine that that fund is utilized to invest in green technologies

26859 :  and that will be catastrophic not just for europe but for the whole global economy

26860 :  now of course athenian democracy didnt last long

26861 :  its because we have confined as i was saying in my talk democracy to the political sphere while leaving the one

26862 :  because if it doesnt the centrifugal forces that will be unleashed will be demonic

26863 :  of course i made mistakes

26864 :  now of course athenian democracy excluded too many

26865 :  to move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive and there is a

26866 :  one peak you understand you know it you recognize it is the mountain of debts that has been

26867 :  if theres any minister of finance or of anything else for that matter who tells you after six months in a job

26868 :  now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession which is never betray

26869 :  may we all be granted a grace of mercy

26870 :  our society shaped by a revolutionary mindset became more polarized and has

26871 :  why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated

26872 :  and every day every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and

26873 :  some of you may work at places where you cant get to certain sites

26874 :  which is ridiculous but thats one of the excuses that managers give

26875 :  companies often think of a one hour meeting as a one hour meeting but thats not true unless theres only one person

26876 :  so just the afternoon one thursday

26877 :  if youre interrupted and woken up you have to start again

26878 :  ive been asking people this question for about ten years where do you go when you really need to get something done

26879 :  and managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people

26880 :  i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business

26881 :  all of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else

26882 :  it doesnt work that way

26883 :  why is that happening

26884 :  theyre for interrupting people

26885 :  giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work

26886 :  one is kind of a place or a location or a room

26887 :  so if youre a manager start encouraging people to use more things like i

26888 :  thats kind of bad

26889 :  he is the author of the little prince

26890 :  they were intentionally framing him but historians dont think thats what happened

26891 :  and vice versa

26892 :  they talked to his teachers

26893 :  they went and searched dreyfuss apartment looking for any signs of espionage

26894 :  theyre about how you feel

26895 :  if you dont support capital punishment same thing

26896 :  they went through his files and they didnt find anything

26897 :  so they compared dreyfuss handwriting to that on the memo and included that it was a match

26898 :  he could never accept that

26899 :  why is that

26900 :  weve spent the last forty years trying to improve care at the end of life and by some measures

26901 :  lets talk about a patient named lisa

26902 :  thats because we do want a peaceful comfortable and dignified death but

26903 :  the closer we get the end of our lives the more fearful we become the more

26904 :  dont take my hope away is what they beg of us near the end

26905 :  hope is vital

26906 :  one of my patients was telling me how upset she was with her oncologist

26907 :  let me give you an example

26908 :  death is not a battle we have lost

26909 :  but as i said this hasnt worked out very well

26910 :  death is not a failure of will

26911 :  he or she votes

26912 :  it increases the accuracy of its prediction

26913 :  you figure it out

26914 :  so its four thousand years old

26915 :  privacy was the central challenge in a small data era

26916 :  three of the traits were ones that people didnt need to look for but that the machine

26917 :  its a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire

26918 :  and what we can do is we can reuse this information for uses that we never even imagined when we first

26919 :  he or she is a stakeholder in society

26920 :  so what is new about big data

26921 :  and that persons job as well as an entire fleet of professionals like that person is going to find that their

26922 :  sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer

26923 :  remember that a one in a million diagnosis if it happens twice in one family is

26924 :  this is how science learns

26925 :  we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet

26926 :  they may not get through it

26927 :  i mean just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak

26928 :  ml its much better than that

26929 :  and like ballet it takes an extraordinary level of training

26930 :  no expensive staff time required

26931 :  david only has one stick

26932 :  youve got to be crazy

26933 :  he says i cant wear this stuff

26934 :  theres no way they think they can take him

26935 :  fortyfive caliber handgun

26936 :  its not this right

26937 :  because he cant see him

26938 :  accuracy we know from historical records that slingers

26939 :  you cant go as you are

26940 :  and throughout history many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly

26941 :  theyre a seafaring people

26942 :  and acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it principally having

26943 :  youre afraid to try

26944 :  im not interested in them

26945 :  even the stars stolen in their infinite grace only show up at the darkest point of night showing

26946 :  me and you we are going to relearn what beauty really is because who taught you that the value of a

26947 :  i see lupita everywhere i go staring at the eiffel tower in paris sitting at a small

26948 :  when will we believe

26949 :  something in you breaks though doesnt it

26950 :  like like amniotic love

26951 :  your math is dangerously wrong

26952 :  like ubani nentu watch her walk with grace

26953 :  look at how your honam shines brown girl

26954 :  are there words in your textbook like like honam

26955 :  when they teach you about honam in the blue eyed classrooms of your schools do they ever actually tell you

26956 :  apparently this is quite normal

26957 :  they work a nine hour day and travel two hours to get there and back

26958 :  theres just a number of things we dont know all of them leading to

26959 :  unfortunately this costs about one hundred grand is not covered by insurance and a lot of the users found they dont even really enjoy

26960 :  disability is also an interesting demographic in terms of people entering the demographic and rehabbing out of it

26961 :  well i guess that parts arguable

26962 :  so what youre looking at here is the latest version of my better half

26963 :  a prosthesis that was designed i was born without legs designed to fill that

26964 :  that number could increase based on the life spans increasing

26965 :  one of the biggest things youll notice this is true for many people with different disabilities is they have a different

26966 :  but a bunch of old guys got together and they noticed you didnt have legs and they were just put you on

26967 :  disability is here to stay and its going to affect people in a broader range than most of us want to

26968 :  my parents thought it be great practice to put me in my legs and have me do dishes

26969 :  many men struggle with what their identity is and thus rely on these outdated ideas of

26970 :  ive found medication which works for me

26971 :  and for a long time i viewed them exactly that way

26972 :  i reached out to what was now my former partner of four years and told them

26973 :  three light years away from us

26974 :  and these signals can travel in great distances and carry a lot of information

26975 :  we know what is meant when we say that something is alive

26976 :  so thats what i did

26977 :  james wanted to use bus rapid transport for that rather than light rail

26978 :  all animal species do it even though we all use slightly different tools

26979 :  maybe youve had that experience as well

26980 :  its essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain

26981 :  and the burden of proof of course is on them not on us

26982 :  i both love and hate the business of human resources and you will soon understand why

26983 :  he wasnt even sick

26984 :  so they are very brave

26985 :  and they both are blind

26986 :  and thats exactly what the pilot did for me

26987 :  so fishermen could only catch what they could either eat or sell that day

26988 :  but the romans developed salting

26989 :  but you can imagine the biomass that represents

26990 :  but the really intriguing thing about the microbes is just how diverse they are

26991 :  and so at that time of course there was no refrigeration

26992 :  so what were experiencing is something called shifting baselines

26993 :  but through a satellite link i was able to sit at my study at home with my dog curled up at my feet a cup of tea in my hand

26994 :  and with salting it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances

26995 :  because gps doesnt work under water

26996 :  and then at some period of time it pops up to the surface and again relays that data back to shore

26997 :  and so what they found in fact is that exploitation really began heavily with the romans

26998 :  thats the sort of technology thats available today that really wasnt available even a decade ago

26999 :  marine organisms do not care about international boundaries they move where they will

27000 :  well from that discussion grew this program that involved two thousand seven hundred scientists from more than eighty countries around the

27001 :  that also doesnt even get into the whole protein extraction that we do from the ocean

27002 :  they are the founding fathers of the one club

27003 :  the first answer to this came from observing how type one diabetics use language

27004 :  to build the story of the one club i drew parallels between the language of the type one diabetes

27005 :  but i could not have been more wrong

27006 :  this contradicted my reality

27007 :  i hope type one diabetics walk away remembering one simple thing

27008 :  and this led me to an incredible place

27009 :  this notion of friendship of community went against what i believed to be good diabetes

27010 :  as my support systems slipped away i realized that my disease had slowly become

27011 :  i want to work a little bit on grounding

27012 :  and then on your exhales start to consciously let those thoughts go

27013 :  we all breathe

27014 :  relax the shoulders

27015 :  so i want everyone to put your glasses down whatever youre holding

27016 :  my name is rachael and im a forrest yoga teacher but it doesnt really matter what kind of yoga i teach

27017 :  so the last thing i want to cover this evening goes back to hands on the ribs

27018 :  so lift and spread your toes

27019 :  another big breath like that

27020 :  on your inhales let whatever it is that is confusing you or that is cluttering your brain

27021 :  what were doing is moving the diaphragm which actually is the strongest muscle in the body were

27022 :  rib cage is pretty big

27023 :  all great ideas start with passion right

27024 :  you can relax your hands down

27025 :  hold the breath

27026 :  we might as well get a little core strength while we are at it right

27027 :  and then with your next two breaths im going to count them out

27028 :  so sometimes we want our breath to fuel our hearts sometimes we want it to fuel parts of our

27029 :  you can do this even in your fancy shoes ive done it

27030 :  so i want you to stand in a way that grounds you

27031 :  let it all out

27032 :  i want you all to feel empowered

27033 :  thats where the real power lies right

27034 :  and so i want you to take your hands and bring them to your ribs

27035 :  lets take three more big breaths like that

27036 :  so actually be able to feel your ribs

27037 :  feel your hands expand

27038 :  let them be down and back

27039 :  huge breath into the back of the heart

27040 :  close your eyes

27041 :  so say youre at your desk

27042 :  you can get your feet on the ground and your toes lifted and spread you can get aware of the heart

27043 :  theyre in there somewhere right

27044 :  im happy to teach these to you at any time any day

27045 :  exhaling slightly pulling in that low belly

27046 :  this is my very favorite forrest yoga position and its because when youre sitting at your

27047 :  so stay right where you are maybe relax your hands again

27048 :  passion is centered right here in the heart

27049 :  relax your shoulders down and back

27050 :  fill up the back of the heart

27051 :  so being in your body is just as important as it is to be in your brain as it is to be in your heart

27052 :  exhale slowly more slowly

27053 :  and the breath is one of the best tools that ive found to be able to be in our bodies be

27054 :  and that often is the biggest challenge saying what is it that im actually passionate about

27055 :  picture that diaphragm moving

27056 :  call me up ill talk you through it

27057 :  so bring your hands back to your ribs

27058 :  whats important to us about the sugar parts weve shown you today isnt that theyre beautiful but that they were

27059 :  i was to be honest fairly weary and nervous about meeting ebrahim

27060 :  i was invited alongside several different comic artists from all over europe from

27061 :  ive witnessed this myself as i run workshops for people from all different walks of life from

27062 :  and it is my hope that more people will start to take the medium of comics more seriously

27063 :  this refugee was one of the one thousand refugees under the age of eighteen who arrive in the

27064 :  five of traditional text based books in the uk are actually

27065 :  there is something incredibly important about telling stories in pictures about

27066 :  and that is how i found myself in april sitting in the offices of the british red cross on a

27067 :  repeatedly even colonel gaddafi created a propaganda biography

27068 :  the british red cross gave comics a chance and saw how they were able to create a new story and spread their

27069 :  it was even spotted being read by home office delegates on a plane following a conference

27070 :  i think that its this kind of primitive and primal nature of visual storytelling which has caused

27071 :  when i was a child i would sit on the floor like i am sure many of you have surrounded by

27072 :  it was picked up in social media and tweeted about by the likes of neil gaiman simon pegg

27073 :  thats our average budget

27074 :  that sounds simple

27075 :  mine is cut off because its not valid anymore i got myself a new one

27076 :  thats the kirpan

27077 :  equality before the law right

27078 :  its also on the one book one lincoln list for this year

27079 :  we bought that t shirt we danced that dance

27080 :  you can be your dreams and you can make your dreams happen

27081 :  i had no idea if kids were going to take it seriously if it actually had any kind of scientific validation

27082 :  i knew i had to validate it

27083 :  and rather ironically adults that controls decision making and impulse control

27084 :  youre taking that step forward for every one around you that youre supporting

27085 :  and you say what can i do

27086 :  why would you do that

27087 :  and the next day tyler jumped off the george washington bridge to his death

27088 :  i want to share some of those with you now

27089 :  and so i did things like travel to south africa where i had an opportunity to

27090 :  but my rule has always been

27091 :  it was incredible

27092 :  we have to come up with a scientific experiment

27093 :  and i felt great about this

27094 :  i shouldve known better

27095 :  and if you were asked to cook at that event that means that youve arrived

27096 :  but you know i wasnt doing it because i thought that organic or local food was better for the

27097 :  and its a question that michael pollan asked some years ago as well

27098 :  i used to pull my truck directly into the greenmarket in union square try doing that today and youll get a lot of bad looks from a lot of

27099 :  why could my home be a museum

27100 :  i never thought again about the matter

27101 :  and i refused to play even that unless i got to be the doctor

27102 :  and you dont have to passively accept what society tells us to think is beautiful

27103 :  so i felt betrayed

27104 :  i come across the casting call

27105 :  not even beyonc made the cut to be an a girl

27106 :  we are going back into our sacred traditions and recognizing that all of our traditions contain the

27107 :  and so i set out to do the only rational thing that someone would do in such a circumstance i quit my job

27108 :  i remember the night that i read about the series of coordinated bombings in the subway system in

27109 :  i can protest

27110 :  its a sign of total submission

27111 :  they were cynics and seekers atheists and rabbis

27112 :  the problem is that after a few centuries the date remains on the calendar but the love

27113 :  and i remember thinking my god what kind of world did we bring this child into

27114 :  everything felt so precarious

27115 :  the other slip of paper says for my sake the world was created

27116 :  i cant control everything and i cannot do this on my own

27117 :  now we had no money no space no game plan but we did have email

27118 :  because emma lazarus was right

27119 :  its called psychic numbing

27120 :  im not supposed to care when black youth are harassed by police because my white looking

27121 :  now throughout history people have committed horrible crimes and atrocities in the name of

27122 :  and so too is anti semitism all of our problems

27123 :  and guess what

27124 :  transphobia and islamophobia and racism of all forms those are also all of our problems

27125 :  within twelve hours twenty million people saw that image of aylan kurdis little body washed up

27126 :  hope may be the single greatest act of defiance against a politics of

27127 :  and as he said getting very wet but being very happy

27128 :  we squander the natural abundance that we already have and we spend vast amounts of resources trying to

27129 :  how was he to feed them

27130 :  so to further spark that will i wrote and published how to books did countless talks and with others

27131 :  and then but dont worry no one was hurt because at just the last moment before their part of the

27132 :  so lets look at that

27133 :  every time it rained hed be out there running watching seeing what was going on

27134 :  how do you go about doing that

27135 :  why the difference

27136 :  well the same as the phiris

27137 :  we still had these sponge like forests along the river that would absorb that rain and

27138 :  and by doing this though it was much more manageable and he could move all the water with the free power of gravity

27139 :  its about partnering with natural systems not fighting them

27140 :  but eventually the storm clouds built and then when the rains came the floods were epic

27141 :  and how did we begin

27142 :  we feed them once at the job site

27143 :  is there anything left to do in your city

27144 :  you see it takes me two weeks maybe two months sometimes to onboard an employee with the city of

27145 :  we had to get people to understand that when they hand five out the window they might be

27146 :  absolutely its making a difference

27147 :  first one is

27148 :  he wants a job

27149 :  we pay our panhandlers nine an hour

27150 :  albuquerque new mexico

27151 :  six over the cost of leaving someone to struggle for survival on the streets

27152 :  i went back to my office gathered my staff around and said

27153 :  at the end of the day when they get back to st

27154 :  but we also had to have community trust

27155 :  albuquerque is now one of the national leaders in combating some of the most stubborn and persistent social issues

27156 :  but yet hes still standing under my sign with a sign that says he wants a job

27157 :  they see that they can make a difference

27158 :  are you ready to think differently about these persistent social issues

27159 :  we can tell the taxpayers we can save you thirtyone
27160 :  and the reasons that people give

27161 :  but when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities theres much less

27162 :  only fortyfive percent of people have ever talked about this

27163 :  so actually if you want to go and make your own mini cemetery then you can

27164 :  but thats pretty much it for formal requirements

27165 :  but theyll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment

27166 :  and then i think no this is the new york city subway

27167 :  like now you can do whatever you want like you gotta get on with that

27168 :  think of something more like zika

27169 :  it spreads quickly

27170 :  but it is harmful to us all the same

27171 :  now implicit bias is different from explicit bias

27172 :  explicit bias is a bias that we know we have and we freely admit to others

27173 :  you and i weve become infected and we not even know it

27174 :  let me give you an example

27175 :  the second minute

27176 :  the next minute ten because theyre getting awake i guess

27177 :  during the first minute well they were sleeping

27178 :  i know that they mean that they hated it and theyre done with it and theyll never have anything to do with it again

27179 :  i actually dont know

27180 :  it certainly has an upper bound

27181 :  is this actually testing whether i know that three four lies between one two and one
27182 :  and sometimes solving a problem is all about changing your perspective

27183 :  theres a likelihood that your problem was actually solved by those mathematicians but i cant blame you for not knowing enough math

27184 :  but without acknowledging the phenomenon not even this first step scientists

27185 :  so we see that defining reality is not so easy

27186 :  they never loved me because i was straight

27187 :  and as i started to come out to more and more people i ended up getting introduced to other women who were like me

27188 :  this is like your foundation

27189 :  so most of us go back and forth between being upright and tense which we think is good posture but

27190 :  why are you bothering

27191 :  and thats why im pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now and this is really a field of its own

27192 :  how are we going to find these planets

27193 :  it reminds me that nearly every day i receive an email or emails from someone with a

27194 :  so i brought my two biochemistry friends and we went to talk to him about our crazy theory

27195 :  but those are not small planets like earth

27196 :  last night i had the strangest dream ive ever dreamed before

27197 :  we were in anticipation of the ed sullivan show

27198 :  everything in our life

27199 :  she had the best definition that i resonated with

27200 :  why is that

27201 :  we know this because when scientist examined former internet addicts they found that

27202 :  this is known as the coolidge effect

27203 :  our minds are powerful things because they influence our thoughts

27204 :  my experience with depression has taught me so much in terms of handling future scenarios

27205 :  i looked past the jealousies of life and started looking toward the future and toward ways that i

27206 :  every single day i returned to school to a place that had fostered such

27207 :  my bed became my hiding place from the world

27208 :  my depression came as a result of not being ready for the realities of middle school

27209 :  fourth graders love their dinosaurs they memorize them

27210 :  theyre basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call

27211 :  it is like for example

27212 :  these are not fantasies

27213 :  i mean why we are making so much fuss

27214 :  at the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean that is the marianas trench off the coast of guam the pressure is more than

27215 :  in order to navigate the challenges of the coming century

27216 :  id like you to hold in your mind if you would for just a moment a mental image of an average bit of the ocean and what

27217 :  activation energy if you like

27218 :  bring a cloth bag to the supermarket

27219 :  chronic problems like plastic pollution are incredibly important because of all of the things the ocean does for us

27220 :  but it doesnt stop there

27221 :  how is this possible

27222 :  its really just a matter of implementation

27223 :  there are fantastic chances waiting out there for us to explore and discover invent things solve

27224 :  they make a living by separating plankton from huge volumes of water and im all but certain that they ingest this

27225 :  say no to the straw

27226 :  i cant help but wonder what impact all those little bits of plastic have on the whales harks that i study

27227 :  but we have to get cracking

27228 :  we will find ways to feed a growing population through fisheries managements and creative aquaculture

27229 :  but the ocean is also a challenging place to work

27230 :  we shouldnt shy away from the challenges of working in the deep ocean

27231 :  but the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things

27232 :  you know from an oceanic perspective four hundred and fifty is way too high

27233 :  why are you doing this

27234 :  im going to pass this onto the tampa office

27235 :  well the first one was is your name hasan

27236 :  who pays for your trips

27237 :  you dont have to waste your energy or your resources

27238 :  and everythings automated at the other end

27239 :  is today tuesday

27240 :  why were you there

27241 :  because no ones really watching

27242 :  so ever since then before i would go anywhere i would call the fbi

27243 :  im watching whos watching me

27244 :  he lost his career as a firefighter

27245 :  for the irs bit i could change the mailing address on file with the irs so the paperwork would go to my accountant

27246 :  then we go to repair

27247 :  what might be the benefits of say a base hit

27248 :  i went from deciding to full blown planning very quickly

27249 :  this decreases emotional reactivity which can be a superpower

27250 :  and i can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted

27251 :  any further out it starts to seem intangible

27252 :  this is very unlike him

27253 :  i sent him a text a few weeks ago asking him had he ever read any stoic philosophy

27254 :  i had no idea what i was doing

27255 :  he was then threatened

27256 :  it runs in my family

27257 :  he and his wife had to flee poland bounce from country to country until they landed in the us with next to nothing

27258 :  now the only person it turns out one son and one daughter siblings didnt get along

27259 :  so i think after several generations and here is the idea we really have a tinderbox

27260 :  but it doesnt stop there

27261 :  and now the boys and the girls get them

27262 :  and they all seemed to be ok

27263 :  but every once in a while like lizzie borden like three times a century and were kind of due

27264 :  and we dont know where its going to pop up

27265 :  but theres gonna be bad news somewhere

27266 :  well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes

27267 :  they have the same brain and the same eeg

27268 :  so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too

27269 :  and now they are close as can be

27270 :  and people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space for a very long time but its always been an abstract mathematical

27271 :  i would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets and i would read about the forces of the small and about quantum

27272 :  they have different rules

27273 :  absolutely not we would be terrible scientists if we did

27274 :  we dont decide where nature places new particles

27275 :  as a kid i would puzzle over questions just like this

27276 :  many of my colleagues had been working their entire careers for this moment and frankly to little curious me

27277 :  but math is math and we can play around with our math however we want

27278 :  but one of these options is huge and it has to do with that long standing question that

27279 :  do we just give up and fly away

27280 :  but then what do we do

27281 :  and well need to encourage more people to join us in studying science since we need fresh eyes on these century old

27282 :  i see the looks on your faces

27283 :  we only decide to keep exploring

27284 :  and to do that we have to build a bigger higher energy collider and the biggest highest energy collider in the world

27285 :  what if the ultimate question what if even artificial intelligence cant help us answer our questions

27286 :  we already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in parts of the lhc but imagine designing a particle

27287 :  thats the stage were at now

27288 :  if we keep designing and building as if the planet had unlimited resources we will

27289 :  i did a rough estimate of how many days i spent commuting to my elementary school in stockholm

27290 :  i should have one

27291 :  the supreme court ruled last month that a policeman has to get a warrant if he wants to do prolonged

27292 :  its called the wave bubble

27293 :  okay what about the fbi

27294 :  on that morning u

27295 :  were almost blindly reliant on it

27296 :  and why is that

27297 :  i was in my office some months back and got a telephone call

27298 :  but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy

27299 :  the traditional surgery is to take a bit of the cranium off a bit of the skull drain this fluid out stick a drain in

27300 :  what im about to show you is a reproduction of this child

27301 :  i work with surgical teams

27302 :  lets stop blaming jackie for being born poor for growing up poor and ending up poor as though its somehow

27303 :  there are far too many jobs in our economy that just dont pay a living wage

27304 :  if we continue on this trajectory im confident well make a lasting change with and for this

27305 :  i remembered your shelter was a such a safe warm place to stay she said so i thought of you when my

27306 :  and why are they so similar

27307 :  they are much more sophisticated in sensing than animals

27308 :  the students in the peer connections program and special education services deserve equal education to

27309 :  now i know what youre thinking where was the teacher

27310 :  as a peer mentor i was able to serve as a classmate to julia a special needs student for the

27311 :  julia and i were equally overwhelmed

27312 :  now let me explain

27313 :  we want to figure it out

27314 :  i mean we repeat the same things over and over again

27315 :  we believe that the only possible choice after school is university the only possible

27316 :  eventually the rats find their way but the human beings will go down the fourth tunnel

27317 :  the rat goes down the fourth tunnel theres no cheese in the fourth tunnel

27318 :  now here is the question

27319 :  we want to solve this part but scramble the other part

27320 :  the rat comes out

27321 :  she told us im going to space and i want to do something meaningful with the data of my mission to reach out to

27322 :  every fiber of my body is tight

27323 :  and no reaching across the table for any food item

27324 :  this is the reason that many people go through life acting like a mediocre race car driver

27325 :  einstein this exam which you just gave to the senior class of physics students

27326 :  for example if you would have a furniture business and one day you would decide to no longer

27327 :  another example if you owned a computer business and one day you decide to no longer sell your computer using a physical

27328 :  its interesting if you look at the data approximately three per cent of people are inclined to even do different things

27329 :  and if you want to have results that youve never had before well you need to start doing things youve never done before

27330 :  if you have tunnel vision thats a bit of a problem because it confuses people about their own performance

27331 :  what is the purpose of thinking

27332 :  because what we have found is that breakthrough innovation extraordinary results happen

27333 :  if you take a closer look at your industry or professional field you also think

27334 :  he was walking on the campus with his assistant and all of a sudden the assistant looked at albert einstein and said

27335 :  einstein how could you possibly do that

27336 :  they said well actually then we make two kinds of taxis

27337 :  in other words what is true for one thousand nine hundred and fortytwo is even more true for today

27338 :  its such a dynamic vibrant place

27339 :  we were all thinking what to do about it and our commisionary in the eu lewandowski said

27340 :  if you go to switzerland and people tell you how was in warsaw

27341 :  he said impossible protocols bla bla bla call fernandes and tell him to do it

27342 :  for years we were disregarded people were not interested in what poles think

27343 :  think about hundred biggest companies in the world

27344 :  they realized that along main transportation corridors people were getting more attacks

27345 :  resolutions not good enough the image is not good enough

27346 :  it also applies to modern medicine as well

27347 :  these are medicines like tibetan medicine ayurvedic medicine and chinese

27348 :  the thread that ties all of these forms of complementary medicine together were the same things that

27349 :  so as i dug deeper what i realized is that what is being called complementary medicine here in the

27350 :  and as i continued my studies what i realized is that those camps of thought were very much

27351 :  but whats interesting is that placebo doesnt seem to just apply to complementary medicine

27352 :  placebos actually made up of a lot of different things

27353 :  once we get rid of the disease were healed

27354 :  is it the biochemical molecular model camp or is it the complementary medicine camp

27355 :  so as a child i read voraciously i loved to read

27356 :  envisage what people have never imagined

27357 :  go to places human beings have not been to

27358 :  we have to muster the will and courage to do what people have never done

27359 :  in some cases religion drives many africans to extraordinary length to attack other human

27360 :  we need to put an end to this game of blame that has prevented us from taking full responsibility for our own

27361 :  in fact six of the ten countries where ninetyfive percent of the population said

27362 :  of course not

27363 :  i promise thats not the case

27364 :  recently i read a book by dr

27365 :  paul kalanithi called when breath becomes air

27366 :  talk to your kids about what grief might look like

27367 :  do you try to rescue them from their bad feelings by saying things like oh at least he

27368 :  think about why your life is meaningful

27369 :  in the book he wrote about his experience in dealing with patients who are dying

27370 :  im asking you to acknowledge that

27371 :  shouldnt we be talking about this stuff and learning how to deal with it

27372 :  why not create your own film festival

27373 :  i asked her and she agreed and i was off to my first new york film festival

27374 :  they make films like that in cuba

27375 :  they said that if my t a mary who was the culture maven in the family would take me

27376 :  it shows a u

27377 :  soldier laughing at people dying

27378 :  you know i was a very young journalist activist at an early age

27379 :  that made you very high profile in iceland

27380 :  and that after a couple of days made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it

27381 :  soldiers are inhuman people

27382 :  that gives the impression has given the impression to millions of people around the world that u

27383 :  thats a problem

27384 :  i mean we have a harm immunization policy

27385 :  intelligence analyst bradley manning arrested and its alleged that he confessed in a chat room to

27386 :  my son isnt

27387 :  icelands a nordic country so like norway its able to tap into the system

27388 :  embassy diplomatic cables

27389 :  instead they publicized your side

27390 :  which way is it going to go

27391 :  how dare you

27392 :  looking back i now realize that the sufi house had a real culture of meaning

27393 :  i met a young man named emeka whod been paralyzed playing football

27394 :  i partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy

27395 :  they make them feel invisible and unworthy

27396 :  each morning my friend jonathan buys a newspaper from the same street vendor in new york

27397 :  and i started searching for those things that make life worth living

27398 :  but it gave them a purpose to rein in the ego

27399 :  ill walk by someone i know and barely acknowledge them

27400 :  its an ongoing process

27401 :  as each day goes by were constantly creating our lives adding to our story

27402 :  i think we all have a pretty regular life but we all also want the

27403 :  it is people who are victims of homophobia or transphobia who are already vulnerable in society

27404 :  or we decide that you could publish a picture of a person without asking them

27405 :  it might seem like a weird wording to you but i really hope by the end of this talk that consent is going to be a central tenet of how you

27406 :  we hear this talk of privacy all the time its always like oh internet privacy they are looking up your private

27407 :  these are the people who need their privacy most

27408 :  consent should be our focus because we want a better world and we want the internet to be a driver of a better world

27409 :  i think thats important

27410 :  all these things are related it all about internet rights

27411 :  for some people they wouldnt mind but i do mind

27412 :  it was not a problem for them but it was a problem for me

27413 :  i we shift the conversation to consent we make it much more easier for people to understand whats actually happening with

27414 :  we dont have all the facts

27415 :  but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go

27416 :  thats not early intervention

27417 :  this is obviously not one of them

27418 :  but we are making progress and because of some of the technologies you hear about today we are actually able to begin to string this

27419 :  are we going to be there soon

27420 :  one million lives every year in this country to heart disease

27421 :  early detection and early intervention

27422 :  so the way that this works is the kinnect is using infra red to see everything thats happening in front of it

27423 :  and while ive been improvising and playing i think to myself

27424 :  but thered be no way to actually add those sounds in the middle of a performance

27425 :  as a matter of fact we added to the contract

27426 :  and you drive on

27427 :  its called the trillion dollar stimulus package

27428 :  you dont do it as a human being

27429 :  peres i will build you the cars

27430 :  thats all the u

27431 :  i know most people dont think of israel as a small island but israel is an island its a transportation island

27432 :  i shared it with a gentleman called bobby kennedy jr

27433 :  a full battery comes on

27434 :  i told him one of the reasons that his uncle was remembered is because he said were going to send a

27435 :  now it sounds crazy

27436 :  we go back down

27437 :  if you had charge spots everywhere and you had battery swap stations everywhere how often would you do it

27438 :  we dont have the industry set right

27439 :  you do it as a machine

27440 :  think of it as a project that spans over about ten years

27441 :  some of it will go back to your own pocket

27442 :  we then decided to scale it up

27443 :  who is one of my idols

27444 :  we didnt say were going to send a man twenty percent to the moon

27445 :  but in some places around the world like scandinavia you already have that

27446 :  the second one was the san francisco bay area where gavin newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors

27447 :  we have a battery bay

27448 :  we decided to come into the u

27449 :  and not from the power of an edict down

27450 :  china solves it by an edict

27451 :  and if you really have a long day you can switch and keep on driving around the island

27452 :  and pick the two best places the one where you didnt need any range extension

27453 :  we have all these regions

27454 :  hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery

27455 :  now were running a stimulus package

27456 :  and these prices are actually with clean electrons

27457 :  thats another thirty percent demand on oil

27458 :  you know what happens at that point

27459 :  it was very quick

27460 :  but back on two wheels at about ten mph i broke back into the speed of discovery and my

27461 :  should i say something

27462 :  at this point youll have broken back into the speed of discovery

27463 :  just one time next week look at the weather forecast choose the nicest day of the week and go for a ride

27464 :  all of a sudden there was more to my path than a beginning and an end

27465 :  thats a trick question

27466 :  i looked back and he was pointing down at the sign in my basket

27467 :  this was two thousand and seven so financially things for a lot of folks werent going very good

27468 :  i would be so happy to have a bike i do not care about color

27469 :  all of my friends have bikes and i cannot go and feel sad

27470 :  with no other option i grabbed my bicycle and i started pedalling

27471 :  it was very simple

27472 :  i knew every nook and cranny of that neighbourhood

27473 :  when his grandmothers away he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandmas bed

27474 :  i mean thats part of how emotions work

27475 :  another way to say this though is that people

27476 :  this makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire

27477 :  it turns out that this score is actually meaningful

27478 :  he jumps back and he gags and we had to do it three times lg

27479 :  he opens you up he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating all at the right temperature

27480 :  so one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions

27481 :  we dont need any of that

27482 :  four and a half hours on the table and everything was done

27483 :  we had to get good quality images from which to make the cad model

27484 :  the project aim is really quite simple

27485 :  so it really is great

27486 :  because he is so successful

27487 :  you have an equivalent in poland no doubt

27488 :  well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team

27489 :  it just began to sort of populate throughout all of culture both gaming and non

27490 :  it just it was everywhere for a long time and for those of you who mightve remembered the late 70s early 80s

27491 :  the way it looked the way it felt the way it sounded

27492 :  and so being in this new world where i didnt really have any friends this gave me something to dig deep into

27493 :  so i started just for fun i pulled out three of my favorite games

27494 :  in eightythree eightyfour the industry was almost non existed

27495 :  and it gave something for my sister and i to play it together

27496 :  but video games i was instantly captivated by

27497 :  today we are in a particularly exciting period in history because with modern nanotechnology tools

27498 :  human fascination for controlling and manipulating light is actually much older than wells probably

27499 :  and that these stained glasses that im showing you as i will show you in a moment in more details are actually

27500 :  in closing id like to say that life is not fair

27501 :  i really love my job i love my research and i just want to keep doing it

27502 :  and so this was sort of the process

27503 :  we havent been able to achieve all of this and certainly not in a clinical setting

27504 :  what you see behind you is a sample from a metastatic breast cancer patient and were

27505 :  because it adds extra steps into this path

27506 :  then i might move to a patient sample

27507 :  so that could easily provide me a lifetime of work

27508 :  and so in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks rather than somehow sensing the day outside

27509 :  and in between they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed

27510 :  they get up just a little bit later every day say fifteen minutes or so and they kind of drift all the way

27511 :  now its not a cancer fighting virus in any way its completely harmless but this is a software company

27512 :  its your rogue cells not someone elses

27513 :  it makes the logical sense to go after cancer one person at a time because no two cancers are the same

27514 :  im kind of an oppositional kind a guy i see people running this way im going to go and take a look

27515 :  its kind of an antibiotic

27516 :  its harmless to humans

27517 :  and that design could be fda proved and regulated

27518 :  it really doesnt matter

27519 :  and i figured

27520 :  thats super cool

27521 :  today we dont even get a day off of work if we get an infection

27522 :  give me an inhaler too

27523 :  ive had a go at this and i can tell you its fun and really cathartic if youve had a bad day

27524 :  high emotionally intelligent people perform well in their jobs

27525 :  theyre happier in their jobs they work well with their colleagues and their job performance is better than low emotionally

27526 :  and next time you get into a conflict situation stop think about how you feel

27527 :  and when weve learned to authentically identify what were really feeling and how it

27528 :  now most of that evidence has been gathered from psychological studies carried out using

27529 :  we may even be married to one

27530 :  its about other people as well because when we start to really understand emotion we can start

27531 :  and you have to regulate and control any prepotent response to say punch the nasty person

27532 :  but it gets much more interesting

27533 :  but all of those responses although they may seem very instinctive dont always

27534 :  now obviously for anybody you probably dont think about the process you go through but that involves a little bit

27535 :  everything would be wonderful if we were all emotionally intelligent

27536 :  workin moms is that for me

27537 :  i say that because i had postpartum depression

27538 :  i dont want to downplay that

27539 :  youre not smart enough

27540 :  thats amazing progress but it also means there are only so many o ring jobs left in farming

27541 :  there will be jobs

27542 :  why are there so few farmers today

27543 :  an ingenious metaphor for this tragic setting is the o ring production function

27544 :  but its equally foolish to say that our fates are sealed

27545 :  its typically ranked 35th among nations in happiness which is low for such a wealthy nation

27546 :  probably something else will break anyway

27547 :  why doesnt this make our labor redundant and our skills obsolete

27548 :  the universe is somehow very different

27549 :  right now this room and this planet and this whole solar system is moving at about half a

27550 :  i cant believe how beautiful this is the system that im a part of

27551 :  this is a picture of the nearest large galaxy to us the andromeda galaxy

27552 :  you can barely see it

27553 :  stars like the sun unravel gently back into space

27554 :  we live in a galaxy very much like this called the milky way

27555 :  if you go at that speed for one year you cover about six trillion miles

27556 :  we can look back to a time when there was nothing but hydrogen gas

27557 :  seven billion years ago its very different indeed

27558 :  stars are amazing things

27559 :  the star gets energy out of that and thats what makes the star shine

27560 :  one hundred thousand times six trillion miles

27561 :  so what happened

27562 :  i want to tell you that story because i never responded to science just as the mathematics just as the

27563 :  galaxies are incredibly huge

27564 :  my atoms come together for a little while

27565 :  its right here inside you

27566 :  i responded to the story and to the drama of it all

27567 :  we come from the stars literally

27568 :  there are times when i feel such exultant joy

27569 :  what happened to change the universe this way

27570 :  theres never been something quite like me or like you

27571 :  you have a conversation

27572 :  what are you struggling with

27573 :  what do you do

27574 :  so one approach might be to tell every professor out there you need to spend a couple of hours with each student one on

27575 :  it sounds kind of funny right

27576 :  how many times have you been in lecture halls like this one

27577 :  my classmate got an arsonist for her first client

27578 :  people who are over forty dont panic

27579 :  but what we hear less about is that theres such a thing as adult development and our 20s are that critical

27580 :  moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid 30s

27581 :  thats what psychologists call an aha

27582 :  now when i heard this i was so relieved

27583 :  so what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say you have ten extra years to start your

27584 :  that was the moment i realized thirty is not the new twenty
27585 :  its a story about a woman named emma

27586 :  but i didnt handle it

27587 :  she loves her new career she loves her new family and she sent me a card that said now the

27588 :  i think we can solve this if we think creatively if we step outside of the box and come up with an atypical

27589 :  what comfort are words to a woman on fire

27590 :  i think ideas are powerful

27591 :  so im making a list of all the things i wished i have said

27592 :  you can control all of those things

27593 :  we are here to talk about ideas

27594 :  its going to probably change the human lifespan

27595 :  were deciphering the code of codes

27596 :  humanity is going to go down this path

27597 :  were reading the book of life

27598 :  another thing is that were just going to have to deal with this knowledge

27599 :  people can try and ban these things

27600 :  nine percent of the letters in the code are the same

27601 :  you just have to look at the human genome project

27602 :  this is where its really central to our lives

27603 :  and thats where about half of our drugs come

27604 :  its going to change the way we manage and alter our emotions

27605 :  its going to change the way we have children

27606 :  and we arent going to be able to support the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster

27607 :  and its going to be used for diet as well and nutritional supplements and such

27608 :  its going to pick up speed

27609 :  now i know theres been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology

27610 :  and it wont be done

27611 :  the first of them is the obvious one the silicon revolution which you all are very very familiar with

27612 :  there are three obvious ways of doing this

27613 :  i dont have any slides

27614 :  thats what we do

27615 :  thats the way these things work

27616 :  directly going in its a little bit further away but not that far away going in and altering the

27617 :  and when it does its not going to be that big a deal

27618 :  and if you dont who are you going to be

27619 :  of course there is going to be genetic engineering

27620 :  but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world which is going to be the case with these technologies when

27621 :  but who is going to pay for all this

27622 :  and that is why they are so very troubling to so many people who would pull back in

27623 :  to imagine that were not going to use these technologies when they become available is as much a denial

27624 :  they undoubtedly will

27625 :  however perhaps one reason why this myth has survived is that there is a slight grain of truth to it

27626 :  in fact one recent study found that when you do try to diagnose peoples personality using rorschach inkblot tests

27627 :  your brain creates patterns from the randomness

27628 :  a recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football shows that players who represent countries with a

27629 :  if you think theyre fighting that means youre a bit more of a nasty aggressive person

27630 :  its more a case of if anything mars and snickers

27631 :  but again this is a myth because nearly everything that you do involves nearly all parts of your brain talking together

27632 :  so by comparing how similar gcse results are in identical twins versus non identical

27633 :  but in fact what happens is that if you analyze the pattern of hits and misses statistically it

27634 :  so a famous study surveyed people from thirtyseven different cultures across the globe from americans to zulus on what they

27635 :  basically the same but you know ones maybe slightly nuttier than the other

27636 :  so have you heard of the idea of the mozart effect

27637 :  and they played the people the music or the stories

27638 :  but this story is a myth for three reasons

27639 :  so its not really a case of mars and venus

27640 :  maybe we could listen to a nice bit of mozart

27641 :  okay so ive been talking for about twelve minutes now and youve probably been sitting there listening to me analyzing my speech

27642 :  thats the best way i can describe it

27643 :  what does this really feel like

27644 :  they didnt have to resist them

27645 :  now this is an important point here

27646 :  it was selfless

27647 :  so i was really focusing on just staying on the trail and at some point in that ride there was no me

27648 :  and their heads didnt explode

27649 :  we just have to get out of our own way

27650 :  it was immensely joyful

27651 :  and they all reported a very good correspondence with increased activity in this posterior cingulate and getting in their own way

27652 :  it was effortless

27653 :  we can really start to pay attention

27654 :  whats life all about

27655 :  its the part of you that yearns really for god

27656 :  hes on this elevator with us

27657 :  and the bible says that david laid up great stores of iron and which archaeologists have

27658 :  and another man looked in my direction and said yes there he is

27659 :  and by the way say yes only if you really enjoy to do that

27660 :  and i didnt understand why my friends were quite reluctant to play this game

27661 :  you say the book is interesting and i say no the book is boring

27662 :  so i was in the party and suddenly i had a brilliant idea

27663 :  i love people

27664 :  oh my god like my mom shes so annoying

27665 :  am i boring

27666 :  so if i would describe it now i might say something like you know my friend when youre laughing now im feeling a bit unsure because i really would

27667 :  what was the experience i was trying to describe

27668 :  thats it no more mouse work

27669 :  for thousands of years humans have been dreaming to reach the stars and yet we have come as

27670 :  and i really worked very hard and when i finished my phd i thought

27671 :  and it turns out this model is everywhere once you start looking for it

27672 :  so what do we do to figure out who is where

27673 :  we turn to the person on the right and we tell that person what we see on our left and vice

27674 :  this is not a drill

27675 :  its not just the cluelessness of youtube engineers

27676 :  it turns out there is no one overall map of the internet

27677 :  and yet mysteriously somehow the bee flies

27678 :  the person said no thats fine

27679 :  the bad news is there is no fire brigade

27680 :  we have a hijacking of youtube

27681 :  and here is the message where one of them says looks like weve got a live one

27682 :  no one pays you to do this

27683 :  and some of them are mid level employees at internet service providers around the world

27684 :  totally mortifying to him

27685 :  they had none of that

27686 :  something is up in pakistan

27687 :  its not a noun

27688 :  jimbos idea was for nupedia

27689 :  same is true if an elite controls the government

27690 :  even if the bullying doesnt occur

27691 :  i think that goes without saying but we need more than that too

27692 :  if the childs so to speak has to run the gauntlet the threat of such bullying that childs not free

27693 :  this we often achieve though our ngos which have such an important part in our civic life

27694 :  the price of liberty as it used to be said is eternal vigilance

27695 :  so for example of course it arises in the home

27696 :  the problem is that while nora is unrestricted while shes not interfered with in the

27697 :  its dependent on the will of the autocrat

27698 :  youve got to share equally in controlling that law

27699 :  second thing we need apart from protection of minorities we also need the protection of majorities

27700 :  and while youre under the will of another a country in this case under the will of another country you cant be

27701 :  a dominos as it used to be called she is dominated in that sense or subordinated or subjected

27702 :  thank you very much

27703 :  and that actually is probably the main theme in the complaints of the americans in the last

27704 :  we need three things at least beyond that

27705 :  public freedom that ive just been talking about means freedom means control means

27706 :  im in this corner of society the government always strikes at us

27707 :  well of course we need an electoral democracy

27708 :  and in order to introduce it let me talk about a play that many of you will know its a

27709 :  an instance of that for example is the law is represented in the police

27710 :  and to convince ourselves that this is the case we captured an

27711 :  this is just trained

27712 :  now here comes little sebastian with a little steam engine in his pocket saying hey guys look at this

27713 :  we drive this road twenty times we put all this data into the computer brain

27714 :  and it took us only two engineers and three months to do this

27715 :  its been contract drafting

27716 :  and the reason is we have an army of students who participate in competitions

27717 :  and back in the day i hired the worlds best software engineers to find the worlds best rules

27718 :  no person can ever study a hundred billion web pages

27719 :  theres no math issue anymore

27720 :  in the very first stage it takes the visual input and extracts edges and rods and

27721 :  it goes stage after stage

27722 :  i mean some people have had ten fifteen twenty melanomas removed and are scared that one might be

27723 :  it feels like thered be an instant demand for an app like this right now that you might freak out a lot of people

27724 :  in fact the pace of invention has gone up not gone down in my opinion

27725 :  so as a result the computer can find rules that even people cant find

27726 :  its the rewriting of code

27727 :  the story goes that our collaborator who is a world famous dermatologist one of the three best apparently looked at

27728 :  im not obliged to use any of those

27729 :  how does machine learning work

27730 :  its going to be even better in my opinion

27731 :  we dont have this magic implant in our brain that gives us the information we want

27732 :  its been the combination of human smarts and machine smarts that make us stronger

27733 :  the last thing i want is for my ai to have consciousness

27734 :  and i think what really will happen is that we can be super creative

27735 :  and i think kasparov was exactly correct

27736 :  thats what is on my mind

27737 :  and then he had a second moment where he said well let me just check with the app

27738 :  thats our secret weapon

27739 :  its a very specific domain specific function and the same is true for our cancer app

27740 :  thats physically not possible

27741 :  an led dress with four thousand four hundred leds that i control with my glove

27742 :  because as an intimacy expert i feel that intimacy is the foundation for

27743 :  and no sooner than she appeared she vanished

27744 :  we traverse time and space through clothing

27745 :  but those that dont will pay much much more

27746 :  the percentage could be equal to that colleges three year cohort default rate as published by the

27747 :  that way the overall penalty that institutions would pay scales roughly

27748 :  well senator richard durban puts it this way

27749 :  you really only have to know three numbers to understand the role of for profits in this mess

27750 :  we got to have some skin in this game

27751 :  college is expensive

27752 :  and its getting more expensive every year

27753 :  thats a subtle point

27754 :  as state governments struggle to balance their budgets students are picking up a larger share of the total

27755 :  but this is not a partisan issue

27756 :  and ultimately the global competitiveness of the united states would go into a tailspin

27757 :  but some institutions would share much more pain than others

27758 :  but other colleges most others would do things like stretching out loan eligibility for students

27759 :  without student loans many students many students would be locked out of higher ed entirely

27760 :  its a one followed by twelve zeros

27761 :  my name is chuck white and i serve as president of weber state university in ogden utah

27762 :  now there seems to be some strong support for this idea

27763 :  these are the ones who fit neither the policy stereotype of the low skilled and the marginalized

27764 :  i dont believe that computers are going to become super brilliant and turn us

27765 :  for good reasons we thought wed never see killer evidence and this is killer evidence

27766 :  the thing thats totally amazing the reason im on this stage is because what that tells us is something deep about the

27767 :  its only two
27768 :  but its not exactly two
27769 :  everyone else in the world can and will continue judging and evaluating you

27770 :  in the oil and mining sector for example there is now the beginning of a truly worldwide

27771 :  until his death in two thousand and six he was the all powerful leader of turkmenistan a central asian

27772 :  he used one to buy the property and another which was in somebody elses name to pay the huge bills

27773 :  well some of that sprang from our work

27774 :  perhaps you saw the film the hollywood film blood diamond the one with leonardo dicaprio

27775 :  now lets go back to the oil and mining companies and lets go back to dan etete and that one billion deal

27776 :  in two thousand and eleven natural resource exports outweighed aid flows by

27777 :  saparmurat niyazov he was one of them

27778 :  so this is change happening

27779 :  but does it just happen over there

27780 :  well weve all heard about what they are i think and we all know theyre used quite a bit by

27781 :  im fifty years old maybe i have another twenty years left

27782 :  in my hometown of lincoln nebraska

27783 :  what do i have to do

27784 :  how do i get people to care

27785 :  similarly i found out the german word for nipple is brustwarze

27786 :  i remember asking my housemates what the german word for a kettle was

27787 :  so i began to set up my own milestones for when i knew that i was making progress

27788 :  and so whilst german taught me a link between maths and poetry that i hadnt previously been able to imagine it

27789 :  and in many ways german is quite a logical and mathematical language

27790 :  and measuring your progress on that journey using verb tables and grammar exams whilst helpful for

27791 :  i remember it being kind of scary when i first came to prison

27792 :  thank you all

27793 :  after the breakup i needed that same sense of control again so i did what came naturally

27794 :  i compartmentalized and i stuffed my emotions back into that messy box

27795 :  why did i feel like i have done something wrong

27796 :  it was almost like my past became prologue and slowly changed what i had come to

27797 :  the brand of trauma i experienced was sexual abuse at the hands of my stepfather

27798 :  but thats just the front facing part of my story

27799 :  and of course it all comes back to a boy

27800 :  and then there was my other stuff

27801 :  so on the ap calculus exam research finds that if we put that checkbox at the top

27802 :  i knew i had to talk with you about this

27803 :  nobody is going to ask you to take a math test in a bathing suit

27804 :  there are a lot of patients where these drugs dont work

27805 :  they have two other things in common that are really important

27806 :  one they have terrible side effects

27807 :  and like i said we only gave a tiny amount of the drug and it lasted for weeks and thats not like anything you

27808 :  five trillion dollars and since they are chronic that cost is compounding and is therefore

27809 :  its actually not that surprising they were caught

27810 :  and mental set is another thing

27811 :  and thats in the patients where they do work

27812 :  and those two things together right one or the two may not have been that important but the two together meant that we had to

27813 :  so we ran it again

27814 :  so we did what you do in science when youre not sure and we ran it again

27815 :  thats sort of this preconceived framework with which we approach problems

27816 :  a painkiller will make you feel better but is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease

27817 :  we use it on the battlefield

27818 :  when doctors first saw this mood enhancing effect of iproniazid they didnt really recognize what they

27819 :  it didnt really look right to me

27820 :  what else we have is data

27821 :  in the second they had to put half of it back

27822 :  think about this

27823 :  this means that we have to think about the question

27824 :  why would somebody not recycle

27825 :  but theyre not

27826 :  and the story went that there was a boy there that was dying

27827 :  they left shorter ladders

27828 :  the night she died my mom was reaching up towards something i couldnt see and i didnt know then that that was part of deathbed

27829 :  mr harrison the last two weeks of his life and kept him company and helped his transition being an easier

27830 :  so one afternoon i forgot to say

27831 :  witnesses talked about how they recognize that the phenomena that were happening were signs that death

27832 :  came down stayed with him and they had a really big party

27833 :  i had had a dream that he was sitting in a chair his legs crossed reading a book

27834 :  we dont talk about death and dying very often

27835 :  im going to go get a drink

27836 :  there were flowers

27837 :  but there was the rugby team

27838 :  people see landscapes

27839 :  she said i really didnt know what else to do

27840 :  one wife said to me she was talking to her husband one afternoon and said do you ever see anybody or

27841 :  now his family had also come

27842 :  im a death educator and a death researcher and that makes me a little crazy

27843 :  his daughter talked about how butch was often in the other room

27844 :  she said whos there

27845 :  theyve got to get somewhere

27846 :  and when we get scared of something very often we stop talking about it

27847 :  i dont want to lose them

27848 :  his parents had come his brothers and sisters

27849 :  i got a text one afternoon from his daughter that the visions had started and everything was okay

27850 :  for that mom and for other folks in my research these visions these deathbed phenomena

27851 :  i want to hear your story

27852 :  he was ready

27853 :  and he was often in the other room

27854 :  there were people talking

27855 :  please tell me your story

27856 :  this is a very common metaphor for the dying

27857 :  butch was a pretty famous rugby player in south africa in his day

27858 :  look at him

27859 :  as a teacher and a mom i cant think of many things that matter as much as reading aloud to our kids

27860 :  she whispered oh

27861 :  at school and at home

27862 :  at all ages

27863 :  because when kids go back to their own books they know that world should come alive in their brains

27864 :  i could translate or decode the words but i wouldnt be able to understand them or think or talk about them

27865 :  arable saved from an untimely death

27866 :  i felt like i was right there

27867 :  well the pig is saved and later that morning fern discovers a carton on her chair at breakfast

27868 :  the decoding of words takes up so much brain energy they dont have a lot of brain space left over to actually

27869 :  like many others at the same time we came up with the idea of source separation

27870 :  and we can extract resources

27871 :  but its not only water which is the problem

27872 :  how do we disrupt this

27873 :  i am fine i am within that concept

27874 :  that will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of venice but probably we can actually

27875 :  they are well structured in many cases

27876 :  how do we do that

27877 :  if youre engaging on twitter information is swirling around in this space via

27878 :  how will they bounce off that

27879 :  another student might say

27880 :  i do that all the time im a mimic

27881 :  winston churchill said

27882 :  no i dont want to go that direction

27883 :  and yeah its private i cant get into your head you cant get into mine

27884 :  and just what amount of energy could actually be unleashed as a result of that

27885 :  what permissions will we give you

27886 :  imagine you were in that event how would you feel in that event

27887 :  do you need to ask permission to talk

27888 :  actually how many students do we have in here

27889 :  but you just havent found it yet

27890 :  let me explain to you my fifty fifty rule

27891 :  but no its not radio

27892 :  high schoolers would be graduating with so much passion they would know exactly what to get

27893 :  but if we are able to share information in a way that respects michaels privacy

27894 :  this really is worth working on

27895 :  why would this kind of thing not work for people who have even more things to manage

27896 :  all he knew was he had to find a place to sleep and to get to his first parole appointment in a couple of

27897 :  of course when he told his parole officer that he lost his job well then she was really

27898 :  in fact i know of multiple cases where people have been picked up because they were in

27899 :  and yet still i remained amazed that she was surviving

27900 :  it goes to bite me a second time

27901 :  we worked together as a team

27902 :  through this act of immense open heartedness he was to become the embodiment of what in south

27903 :  achievement is shared

27904 :  he fixed roads he mended wetlands he did some anti poaching

27905 :  he was bringing peace to a divided and violent south africa one man

27906 :  take a moment and think about our good friend dorothy from the wizard of oz

27907 :  it should be so exciting to be out in the world to be free

27908 :  lets do another experiment

27909 :  so that is my claim

27910 :  we find patterns and we represent them

27911 :  i want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is

27912 :  we can even write it simply like one
27913 :  and i think this is a nice day to day definition

27914 :  try to change your perspective

27915 :  my claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change your perspective

27916 :  its the volume of the sphere

27917 :  and i would go as far as to say that every equation is like this every mathematical equation where you

27918 :  ok so why am i doing all this

27919 :  i busied myself telling stories and sharing stories and collecting them

27920 :  he thinks that scuba divers must have the most wonderful job in the world

27921 :  moved to a house near a park

27922 :  so much water to glide through

27923 :  i like to revisit old poetry because it shows me exactly where i was at that moment

27924 :  and what it was i was trying to navigate and the words that i chose to help me

27925 :  opens his eyes at once

27926 :  his fingers find the pillowcases sailing masts

27927 :  tiny dots of light blinking out of him from out of the darkest darks

27928 :  it was only a matter of time

27929 :  i dont mean this metaphorically

27930 :  but just because i end the poem doesnt mean that ive solved whatever i was puzzling through

27931 :  and i use poetry in my life as a way to help me navigate and work through things

27932 :  he turns on his side

27933 :  and the only two rooms in the house with walls that reached all the way up to the ceiling and doors that opened and closed were the

27934 :  and last year i tried it for the first time and i was thrilled by the efficiency at which i was able to produce

27935 :  it wasnt always easy

27936 :  they are too busy recalculating what this all mean for lost time

27937 :  but they kept the loft at wooster street for birthday parties and treasure hunts

27938 :  before she was wife she was artist

27939 :  a year later he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire stayed for a week hunting it with his

27940 :  he showed up at world war ii with a smirk and a hobby

27941 :  they got married

27942 :  but at the end of the month i looked back at these thirty poems i had written and discovered that they were all trying

27943 :  we have both learned the art of capture

27944 :  and my art skills were crappy

27945 :  and if you are sure of where youre going i want you to remember the second story of having enough

27946 :  but ive never quite gotten a problem like fold whatever you want

27947 :  but the jobs not done yet

27948 :  what we need to do now is map near earth space

27949 :  one of the reasons neowise is so valuable is that it sees the sky in the thermal infrared

27950 :  so the next time youre in an airplane snag a window seat look out and imagine a rock so enormous that

27951 :  weve repurposed it to discover and study asteroids

27952 :  five billion kilometers

27953 :  you may have heard of it

27954 :  its japan its four per one hundred thousand
27955 :  do you know where its three per one hundred thousand
27956 :  and i learned a new word last week

27957 :  well guess what

27958 :  if we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities as they do in europe we shall become as corrupt as they are in europe and take to

27959 :  and we take car crashes for granted

27960 :  and you see this alignment this strange alignment

27961 :  these changes and others like them changed the way that portlanders live and their vehicle miles traveled per day the

27962 :  so we decided our next project it should be live

27963 :  this is so completely different to other tv programming

27964 :  so he said why dont we make a radio program marking the day of the german invasion of norway in

27965 :  you rig them and you see whats happening

27966 :  its like a sports event

27967 :  so we called our commissioning editors in oslo and we said we want to make a documentary about the bergen railway

27968 :  there is no story line no script no drama no climax and its called slow

27969 :  i just kept talking

27970 :  then i sought the dictionary

27971 :  so in that moment i stood there and although i was afraid i realized that

27972 :  so i needed to start consulting in myself and trusting myself more

27973 :  oftentimes we choose one emotion

27974 :  my mother is schizophrenic

27975 :  and the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time

27976 :  and then the production designer started clapping

27977 :  i gave my intro and i played the jellyfish scene

27978 :  then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look

27979 :  as humans we have the white of our eye the colored iris and the black pupil

27980 :  maybe because unlike normal we were basing it on something in real life or maybe just because we had lost our way

27981 :  but then i got my first taste of lighting

27982 :  a country which people just wrote off as another east european basket case

27983 :  the food was really bad it was like east european

27984 :  eastern europe is integrated into western europe to the point where the concept doesnt make sense

27985 :  hes very corrupt hes in with organized crime

27986 :  roma is a terrible european social problem

27987 :  countries which are a bit weird a bit different its eastern europe its almost used as a term

27988 :  but it sort of made sense

27989 :  its not about the euro

27990 :  again this is not

27991 :  the credit ratings are going up

27992 :  western europe basically free eastern europe basically not

27993 :  and if we make categories make them real ones with real common characteristics

27994 :  and thats kind of true

27995 :  so even then it was a pretty untidy concept

27996 :  lets deal with the countries of europe as they are

27997 :  make it half a trillion

27998 :  no worries about weird extremist parties

27999 :  the hi tech industry would like stronger protections for producers

28000 :  now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what theyre able to recover in settlements

28001 :  now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way

28002 :  well during the settlement process when we received our copy i struck it

28003 :  never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l

28004 :  the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors

28005 :  dont forget that

28006 :  with no employees

28007 :  and as a result the patent troll can claim that they won the case

28008 :  in the case of gooseberry natural resources this patent on emailing news releases had sort of a fatal flaw

28009 :  it learns very much from its mistakes

28010 :  and as we sit exchanging free ideas with each other there are still people mining coal in order to power the

28011 :  its something which everybody whos involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it

28012 :  we need national responses

28013 :  we need local government responses

28014 :  but the world isnt second life

28015 :  and thats why now the new breakthroughs the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in

28016 :  there is no great central organization that pushes this people just pick up an idea and they run with it and they implement it where they

28017 :  you know its a kind of nice idea but what do they actually do on the ground

28018 :  so the ipcc said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in two thousand one hundred in their worst

28019 :  and it is something which has several characteristics

28020 :  and it feels historic

28021 :  but all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading

28022 :  already thats fallen to about eleven
28023 :  and also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies

28024 :  and how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody

28025 :  it tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary

28026 :  and so out of the blue i decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the archimedes palimpsest

28027 :  there are about five of these in the world

28028 :  i read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years

28029 :  these are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar a reader of texts into a

28030 :  what an unsatisfying word reader is

28031 :  imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown

28032 :  that youre going into an automobile dealership to buy a car

28033 :  when i was asked to describe myself for this talk i chose three words

28034 :  perhaps another story will help do that as well

28035 :  the good news for me was that this experience forced me to

28036 :  and if you look around this audience its probably the second leading cause of death in this audience

28037 :  largely because i think i considered it and i was worried that other people might think it a frivolous way to

28038 :  and i thought oh my god i dont remember what i had replied to that one

28039 :  and i am going to try right now

28040 :  well we can simply bet on it

28041 :  and im going to show you how

28042 :  we call it the blind driver challenge very exciting

28043 :  its a very ambitious goal but we truly believe we can do it

28044 :  this is last year in china

28045 :  i directly run to my home office sit at my computer i type in the ideas i sketch things out and i keep a database of

28046 :  but just a spark of imagination is not good enough

28047 :  these are all the tools we need

28048 :  how do we develop these kinds of ideas

28049 :  we also have the worlds very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind

28050 :  we won a half a million dollars in the darpa urban challenge

28051 :  so i need to decipher what i wrote

28052 :  so right next to my bed i keep a notebook a journal with a special pen that has an led light on it because i

28053 :  this is where school comes in

28054 :  now this robot is currently our star robot

28055 :  and they assemble and they form these kinds of mechanisms

28056 :  with yunity we will not only provide the groundbreaking tools and knowledge to make the foodsharing success story

28057 :  one which was from panama and another one which was from mexico

28058 :  it was like a sign for us and the next day we went more energetic and motivated than ever before to the

28059 :  but for every problem there is at least one solution

28060 :  doctors without borders is an amazing organization dedicated and designed to provide emergency care

28061 :  five million people

28062 :  you wake up one morning however and you discover that the reason there are no rules is because theres no government

28063 :  how will i pay them

28064 :  i wonder what that means

28065 :  in what currency will i pay them

28066 :  what am i going to do

28067 :  it took us thirteen days to reach the czech republic

28068 :  she couldnt go outside

28069 :  even though it was night and everyone was trying to calm us down we couldnt stop laughing

28070 :  she had to stay at home

28071 :  we ended up better get together with friends

28072 :  lets hope it happens before im gone

28073 :  im still waiting for

28074 :  you have to concentrate

28075 :  i knew nothing about ted

28076 :  you have to place your foot carefully

28077 :  i know we will make up for lost time as we walk through this world hand in hand

28078 :  my call to action today is a very simple one it would require only a rule change and that would be to

28079 :  with your back against the bars which confine you and your soul free from the shackles which held you bound

28080 :  mars may hold that secret for us

28081 :  thank you guys so very much

28082 :  but donnas biggest supporter came from an unexpected place

28083 :  my cousins all teach

28084 :  now whats hard to put together but is true is that many times these are the same children

28085 :  something that would stick to their ribs she said

28086 :  theyre willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and

28087 :  i dont think anyone does

28088 :  all of this is great

28089 :  it helps us to raise awareness

28090 :  and not to mention al gores inconvenient truth in two thousand and six that addressed to the world with factual ipcc

28091 :  so we watched that sun

28092 :  and that sun didnt set ill tell you what it melted

28093 :  and that was the a ha moment

28094 :  we engaged with people we stayed at a cattle ranch in the australian bush country where im not quite sure

28095 :  we were going to take photos of us with him on major world landmarks

28096 :  we realized that our life was changing and we were changing with it

28097 :  we tried to have some experiences that we wouldnt otherwise have

28098 :  thirtyone of greenhouse gas emissions originate from our food consumption

28099 :  i came along this study and i got stuck i could not let go of it up to this day

28100 :  how to care for the weakest in the community

28101 :  how will latvia have enough latvians

28102 :  and when do we collaborate

28103 :  if people know and understand why and how business leaders make decisions it is easier

28104 :  and how to be simply great

28105 :  how do we keep them apart

28106 :  over the years ive realized that there are three key elements that bring about change

28107 :  i want to be the lion

28108 :  it s not a lie

28109 :  if you strip the word new out of it the question that comes to me

28110 :  my brother was always there for me when i needed him

28111 :  no of course its a lie

28112 :  and she opened the door and she led us into the living room and there on a sofa in

28113 :  now i tell you when you grow up in israel these stories theyre not only words on a

28114 :  lullaby has evolved and now takes place in numerous healthcare settings

28115 :  as lullaby has evolved its also broadened out and the first lullaby that youll hear is called

28116 :  we wondered what might happen if these young women would have the opportunity to collaborate with artists

28117 :  and she said that these young women were not really ready to have children and in addition to that they

28118 :  how do we serve people through music

28119 :  he was staffing a lullaby project working with some young women who were

28120 :  we started to wonder about lullabies

28121 :  we were in a room with doctors and nurses and staff from jacobi some of our

28122 :  it doesnt have to be as exciting as involving flames and explosions like my chemistry professor

28123 :  its about one tenth the diameter of the strand of human hair

28124 :  this reaction was done just using regular tap water and sodium

28125 :  the electrode end consists of a single strand of carbon fiber

28126 :  in my mind this might be the biggest leapfrog of them all

28127 :  we need to do more of the things we in africa want to do with the appliance set

28128 :  we can pay them off over a daily or a weekly schedule

28129 :  in fact it started to drive the recall the complexity of that software started to drive our recalls

28130 :  this is a wonderful thing for us

28131 :  its there for us to have but weve got to solve this choke point and its going to change your lives so its worth

28132 :  youve seen them i think on yachts right

28133 :  youve seen these things on boats

28134 :  we needed a breakthrough

28135 :  i still struggle with what more i can do

28136 :  this was my family

28137 :  and do this

28138 :  but i say this

28139 :  we began to deal with our youth and with those who we consider are on the wrong side of the fence

28140 :  and stop that

28141 :  i was just so tired

28142 :  they came and said stop that

28143 :  it was those guardians it was that village mentality

28144 :  we said this is your community table

28145 :  i love being a police officer because its always been a calling for me and never a job

28146 :  3d forms are really hard to represent on 2d pieces of paper or a 2d computer screen

28147 :  so this is where i wanna tell a little bit about how ive been using 3d printers

28148 :  and the photos im showing here today are sort of a mix of our work

28149 :  what if i dont own a 3d printer

28150 :  these days its actually not a problem

28151 :  schools libraries maker spaces studios garages and workshops

28152 :  but those first 3d printers were really expensive hundreds of thousands of dollars and so they were really only

28153 :  you know what i know what this space looks and feels like and i know where i fit into it

28154 :  and together they collaborated on a 3d printed prosthetic

28155 :  and as a designer do i devalue my work when i give it away for free or

28156 :  partly because the patents started to expire

28157 :  initially this dynamic felt really foreign to me

28158 :  whether its a car or a phone product designers use prototypes to test the

28159 :  why would i make my intellectual property and hard work available for free

28160 :  i formed an international organization

28161 :  so as i look at it i go through the elements of the threat

28162 :  i see things like groundwater overdraft

28163 :  this is the kind of narrative that has to be changed

28164 :  there are five or ten people who read the details of all of it

28165 :  my background is as a scientist

28166 :  theres tremendous over pumping

28167 :  how we can choose to have local agriculture how we can choose to have local water management how we can

28168 :  how instead of talking individually we can talk as groups

28169 :  it doesnt communicate to everybody and it doesnt give that tangible sense of what we can really

28170 :  so its innovating

28171 :  the world i live in is full of reports and papers

28172 :  but its also the slight shift in balance and telling that story

28173 :  schreyer a year later and i said mr

28174 :  they were from moldova and i was like oh my god where am i going

28175 :  there were so many stories i went to different universities and did lectures about communities and i was lucky enough to go to williamsport

28176 :  and i found out that their stories were like ours and they were like oh we would love to have a mural like this in our country

28177 :  it was the day before we were leaving moldova and she got a hold of me

28178 :  so i started to think how wonderful it would be to take the mural in state college stitch it on the internet to the mural in

28179 :  they also liked the idea so yuri and i went to different business owners and different people in the community and everybody that we went

28180 :  after she spoke out a woman who was seventy years old came up to my daughter and said i was raped like you when i was your age and i

28181 :  i went back to mr

28182 :  my whole life ive been painting murals

28183 :  marshall was dying at the time so i took that painting into his deathbed and his daughter was reading him the letters while i was

28184 :  i ground the metal off the back of the crosses and when we put the crosses up we put religious symbols

28185 :  it thought about all my artist friends

28186 :  they were sending me articles and letters

28187 :  schreyer youre going to hate that you taught me that one thing

28188 :  ann olivet was getting ready to go to norway to meet with her nephew who is a famous comedian jan bach assumed spelling

28189 :  we got on the plane we you know we were diverted because there was fog over moldova to romania

28190 :  we flew to norway and we met with him and we also were amazed by how people just

28191 :  she said why dont you and yuri come with us

28192 :  listening to you i am now going to get help

28193 :  so we took the money that we raised on that project and we bought plane tickets

28194 :  my friends would say you know the guy from ghostbusters the evil guy he was from moldova

28195 :  eighty firefighters buff those crosses for an hour a day for eighty days straight

28196 :  so i got on facebook and i facebooked over three hundred stella rotarus

28197 :  she talked about what happened to her

28198 :  but not everywhere

28199 :  we feel quite comfortable safe and happy

28200 :  is it really that serious

28201 :  species that do not evolve die

28202 :  and they say these things as if its ok

28203 :  are there men around that table

28204 :  are there moms whove raised boys around that table

28205 :  and so we should

28206 :  after all if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex the risk of infection in one intercourse

28207 :  we have serial monogamy

28208 :  vodka new years eve new partner for the spring

28209 :  in sweden we have no concurrency

28210 :  it is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it

28211 :  probably its a combination of this

28212 :  vodka midsummers eve new partner for the fall

28213 :  twentyfive years it took

28214 :  its a spiral to ever increasing capabilities but we need to know when we seek to learn and when we seek to

28215 :  the best salespeople at least once a week do activities with the goal of improvement

28216 :  it very much does

28217 :  we focus all our time on just doing our job performing which turns out not to be a great way to improve

28218 :  he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors but he also realized that being a lawyer

28219 :  so the way to high performance is to alternate between the learning zone and the performance zone purposefully

28220 :  well learn from your mistakes

28221 :  this has been shown to be true in teaching general medicine nursing and other fields and it happens because

28222 :  a tightrope walker doesnt practice new tricks without a net underneath and an athlete wouldnt set out to first try a new move

28223 :  of course he studied a lot

28224 :  for example we might find a mentor or a trusted colleague with whom we can exchange ideas or have vulnerable

28225 :  and it was a hot day and he said hey would you like some fresh coconut water

28226 :  as a telephone market

28227 :  but sometimes it just sat there

28228 :  i mean the proliferation of indian restaurants since i first went abroad as a student in the mid 70s and what

28229 :  in fact legend has is that when doubting thomas the apostle saint thomas landed on the shores of

28230 :  and that makes us larger than the u

28231 :  the americans have even recognized it in an agreement

28232 :  the other day i was in kerala my home state at the country farm of a friend about twenty kilometers away from

28233 :  but hes carrying a 21st century instrument

28234 :  rather than minding the store

28235 :  i have read a reuters dispatch so this is not indian propaganda a british news agency about how robbers in the

28236 :  and we continue to grow

28237 :  we cant really be both of those

28238 :  and he whipped out his cellphone dialed the number and a voice said im up here

28239 :  because ultimately that electoral outcome had nothing to do with the rest of the world

28240 :  we know we have that

28241 :  that is a 21st century story as well as an ancient one

28242 :  it was essentially india being itself

28243 :  governments arent very good at telling stories

28244 :  afghanistan we know what a serious security problem afghanistan is for so many of us in the world

28245 :  within seventytwo hours im on a plane heading north

28246 :  and they rush back home

28247 :  so i make a bunch of phone calls i buy a ticket of course

28248 :  i was desperate to go and find out for myself

28249 :  that was my cue

28250 :  and how can men tame eagles

28251 :  because i knew that i had failed

28252 :  and at the center of every target was an arrow

28253 :  we talk about grimms fairytales

28254 :  the child nodded

28255 :  he knew hundreds and hundreds of them he really genuinely did and his stories went into

28256 :  and if grimms fairytales were named according to author rather than to editor then theyd be called something like

28257 :  i happened to be comp ring which is like the kiss of death to somebody in a job like mine

28258 :  that reminds me of a story

28259 :  underneath we are the same

28260 :  and the king said how did you manage it

28261 :  his name was yaakov krantz and he was real

28262 :  the rabbi of dubno was not a fictional character

28263 :  somebody asked him once how he managed it and his answer was this

28264 :  its a reminder

28265 :  so i decided the first thing i could do was tell them a story about storytelling

28266 :  there are no grimms fairytales

28267 :  and i finished twenty minutes early

28268 :  if anything goes wrong you have no power but all the responsibility as the comp re

28269 :  its not something that we find in the story its something that we bring to the story

28270 :  and thats important

28271 :  the grimms didnt tell any fairytales

28272 :  and the story was simply this

28273 :  its not so much about reinventing humans its more about figuring out how we extend ourselves right

28274 :  so when hed come visit in person he no longer stood over me as he was talking to me he would sit down and talk to me eye to

28275 :  when youre thinking about robotics

28276 :  youre talking too softly im going to turn up your volume which is like having a coworker walk up to you and say youre speaking too softly

28277 :  they dont get called robot anymore because they actually serve a purpose in our lives

28278 :  we cant treat humans as if were just one monolithic thing

28279 :  how are different people going to grapple with that loss of control

28280 :  its goal is to make my house sixtysix degrees fahrenheit and it senses the world

28281 :  things die when theres no food

28282 :  theyre comical they walk upright and of course theyre diligent

28283 :  and more importantly theyre well dressed

28284 :  why do they do that

28285 :  and some of you consider them almost part of your family

28286 :  so penguins are amazing athletes

28287 :  magellanic penguins the ones that i work on they can dive to about ninety meters and they can stay

28288 :  most important of all i didnt know what that was the first time i heard it

28289 :  and this is true of most of our living systems

28290 :  but weve been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go

28291 :  there were plenty of them

28292 :  you have to train to be able to do that

28293 :  theyre not breeding theyre not even around

28294 :  if you had a relationship with a penguin youd see it in the same sort of way

28295 :  so a lot has happened in the last forty years and what i learned when i came to the galapagos is the importance of

28296 :  we usually dont and we want to start getting the accounting system right so we can pay the real cost

28297 :  so when i went to study the magellanic penguins i didnt have any problems

28298 :  if you had finished some form of higher education you got a red key cord with your name tag on it instead of a blue one

28299 :  its called satisficing

28300 :  and this is where i was

28301 :  they fled iran in terrible circumstances one night

28302 :  stand up for justice and never ever give up

28303 :  you are not allowed to see them because lawyers visiting hours in immigration detention are nine to seventeen
28304 :  and with more wit than preparation i said well do you think it appropriate to know about these matters and remain silent

28305 :  the guards said no

28306 :  some doctors cracked under the pressure

28307 :  i was born in the johannesburg township of soweto not far from here

28308 :  my father was an alcoholic and life at home was often very tense

28309 :  was it all wasted

28310 :  i tried to talk some sense into him

28311 :  while interrogating my journey through medicine i also spoke to other doctors who had chosen to walk away

28312 :  my world nearly did collapse when my brother died when i was fourteen years old

28313 :  i even showed him where id made my notes in his folder

28314 :  thats when i heard him in the room next to mine

28315 :  its a powerful act to put your hand up and say im struggling

28316 :  it would serve a country

28317 :  and this would likely happen one by one

28318 :  so i became so frustrated and my wife became frustrated so we decided to go start up our own

28319 :  as part of that promise we do not spend any money on north american salaries that

28320 :  and that sense that i had wasnt just a sense its the truth

28321 :  now we send satellites to different orbits depending on what theyre needed for

28322 :  youre out of gas

28323 :  there is without doubt congestion in the low earth and geostationary orbits and we cannot keep launching new

28324 :  but then you suddenly remember that this car you bought could never be fixed if a part breaks or

28325 :  now mount everest is actually an interesting comparison of a new approach to how we interact with our environments

28326 :  theres agricultural and environmental monitoring internet connectivity navigation

28327 :  and then you eye that your fule gauge has dropped below empty

28328 :  youve got your music cranked your windows rolled down with the cool breeze blowing through your hair

28329 :  and imagine the debris that would be strewn everywhere if a collision actually happened thousands of

28330 :  it just wasnt designed that way

28331 :  so i grew up with the huge appreciation for the outdoors and the keen sense of our footprint on the environments we interact

28332 :  theyre only in place to limit the future creation of debris

28333 :  in that instant moment of panic you scan your front dashboard looking for what could be wrong

28334 :  imagine if a robotic arm on some sort of space tow truck could fix the broken components on a satellite

28335 :  one of the most common places we send satellites is the low earth orbit possibly to image the surface of earth

28336 :  they might run out of propellant they could malfunction or they may just naturally reach the end of their

28337 :  but that doesnt mean we shouldnt do everything in our power to protect the environments that we rely and

28338 :  and then one really cool possibility is the idea of orbital tow trucks or space mechanics

28339 :  what if there actually were international laws with teeth that enforced end of life disposal of

28340 :  so maybe you get into things like high powered lasers or tugging using nets or tethers as crazy as those

28341 :  theres also complex space laws and politics that we have to sort out

28342 :  these guidelines are also not long term theyre not proactive nor do they address the debris thats

28343 :  what if all satellites regardless of what country they were built in had to be standardized in some way for

28344 :  tristan a west point track star who always ran and road marched with no socks

28345 :  so i challenge all of you

28346 :  it truly feels like a dream

28347 :  it is farely rare affecting only one in every fifty thousand people worldwide

28348 :  in that two week period high levels of phenylalanine could already be doing damage to their body

28349 :  this has been my dream

28350 :  companies like sesame street and school house rock have successfully put educational contents to

28351 :  in the united states weve lost fiftyfive languages since one thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven
28352 :  ive got some people raising their hands

28353 :  my first language was russian and i learned how to read and write in russian before english

28354 :  we all know what it feels like to hear songs from our childhood and we remember exactly where we were

28355 :  which in ladino means to bang if i had read it in the book i probably wouldnt remember it

28356 :  and we have another one hundred and seventy languages at risk of extinction

28357 :  i m co producing a documentary called saved by language about a sephardic bosnian boy who saved his life

28358 :  when we lose these languages we lose centuries worth of art music history

28359 :  but we might not remember what was on your shopping list yesterday

28360 :  but we re not gonna stop there

28361 :  you have to think in a different way

28362 :  if the aliens are watching us from the nearest stars theyre seeing us as we were years ago

28363 :  but the consistency of the answers that we get show us that this assumption seems to be true

28364 :  youre not really seeing me now

28365 :  all of the atoms in your body were made somewhere

28366 :  all the carbon oxygen all that stuff was made in the fiery furnaces of stars that spewed their guts into

28367 :  if i throw them while im running away theyll go slower

28368 :  the top of the back

28369 :  you think you are but you are really seeing me as i was one hundred nanoseconds ago or so

28370 :  just a mystery

28371 :  ten to the eleven starts in one galaxy

28372 :  ours are just arranged better

28373 :  in the time it took me to say that ten to the twelve of them passed through your eyes

28374 :  we also now know that planets around other stars are common

28375 :  i think there are three amazing thoughts that i like to keep in mind

28376 :  my own specialty is neutrinos

28377 :  just like in a sonnet or a tweet where the rules make you do more

28378 :  were trying to figure out the nature of this dark energy and dark matter

28379 :  we see a richer tapestry

28380 :  boost from the mozart than the stories but the people who preferred the stories to the mozart music got a bigger i

28381 :  what is true that ambidextrous people or people who use both hands for different tasks are more

28382 :  quite a few people there

28383 :  the people who preferred mozart music to the stories got a bigger i

28384 :  and they played the people the music or the stories

28385 :  firstly and most crucially the lab coat wasnt white it was in fact grey

28386 :  a famous study surveyed people from thirtyseven different cultures across the globe from americans to zulus on what they

28387 :  if you think theyre fighting youre a bit more of a nasty aggressive person

28388 :  and one thing you might think about doing is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them

28389 :  but as i searched around in the darkness i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i

28390 :  and its not the first time aid organizations have done this

28391 :  but that does not absolve humanitarian aid organizations from being very serious

28392 :  and does the aid do more harm than good

28393 :  rwanda really was exceptional these camps

28394 :  and so there are two things i think that aid organizations really need to think about today

28395 :  since the nine eleven many aid organizations have rejected

28396 :  and i think if aid organizations rather than just paying lip service to some of the humanitarian principles at the

28397 :  it is simply a tool that aid organizations need to use in order to get access to people most in

28398 :  from these 1980s of taking sides in conflict was that often the warriors that we celebrate

28399 :  so its certainly not a new thing but one of the lessons

28400 :  on the one hand they tend to lament this instrumentalization of aid in some circumstances but in others

28401 :  no aid organization is able to say that one hundred of their aid can get

28402 :  so i tried an experiment

28403 :  anyone whos ever opened a fridge to find moldy strawberries or a bag of soggy spinach knows how frustrating and

28404 :  and today our mission is fresh for all

28405 :  black people usually have black families

28406 :  we all came together and stood as one

28407 :  and in doing so we formed a family

28408 :  hamilton has proved that history remembers

28409 :  we live in times where hate and fear seem stronger

28410 :  or will some mad man with a gun rip it away from me because my identity differs to the norm

28411 :  im excited because i want a wife i want a child i want a family

28412 :  muslim people usually have muslim families

28413 :  in most scenarios minorities they have their family

28414 :  while collecting his tony award on worldwide television speech writer and playwright lin

28415 :  before i finish i would like to share with you the words of a man who did just that

28416 :  but will i be able to have that family in peace

28417 :  so we turn to our lgbt family

28418 :  it scared me because i look to the future and im excited

28419 :  we need people to accept us because if every heterosexual person was part of our extended family

28420 :  every province had its own market for agriculture

28421 :  a lot of the indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things

28422 :  but today finally after economic reforms and economic growth i think the notion that cities

28423 :  but today democracy has become a bottom up process where everybody has realized the benefits of

28424 :  this policy is causing gridlock

28425 :  and therefore democracy has become embedded

28426 :  forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than twenty cents

28427 :  and we can do better than that as a city

28428 :  and i thought to myself these cabs arent just numbers these are gps recorders driving around in our city streets recording each and every

28429 :  theres just a rush day

28430 :  and it wasnt just me who found a parking ticket

28431 :  we can do better than that as a city

28432 :  when is rush hour exactly

28433 :  and this is not the kind of fact that youre going to see boasted in a city report right

28434 :  but the fact that we have citizens walking around with hard drives picking up data from city agencies to make it public it was already kind of public

28435 :  and thats where this data came from

28436 :  number one never swim in anything that ends in creek or canal

28437 :  its not the best use of our citizens time and we as a city can do better than that

28438 :  its not going to be the front page on nyc

28439 :  we dont need our citizens walking around with hard drives

28440 :  nyc that allows you to subscribe to three hundred and eleven complaints around your own home or around your office

28441 :  you put in your address you get local complaints

28442 :  im going to write a program

28443 :  we now have technology that will measure and monitor our own health and give us some information and feedback

28444 :  these functional foods have been a revelation for food manufacturers everywhere because theyve shown that

28445 :  this was long before we had the research know how and even the technology to be able to prove that

28446 :  how have these foods changed

28447 :  were all starting to wear fitbits people are starting to take notice of their own health

28448 :  is this a real possibility

28449 :  and ask yourself the question

28450 :  will your health insurer be dictating what you eat and will food no longer become a choice but rather a way

28451 :  so the sale of trans fat alternatives went through the roof during this decade

28452 :  but the way in which your body sees these bacteria and viruses is the same way that it can see and recognize

28453 :  whats different about these foods

28454 :  are saying that they spend three out of every four dollars in payouts for people with chronic disease

28455 :  this is a song that i wrote last year

28456 :  thank you very much

28457 :  so after a few instances of this steve happily became seve

28458 :  when it comes to personal habits its really easy to see the problem

28459 :  just time after time

28460 :  not all behaviors are the same

28461 :  aj is like many people when they try to quit smoking

28462 :  she wrote it on a 3x5 card and she didnt commit to stick to her diet stick to her plan

28463 :  she had to go to them and say

28464 :  why were you tempted

28465 :  but thats not the lesson

28466 :  and gained four hundred and forty
28467 :  but no this one

28468 :  what was the new crucial moment

28469 :  can i do it

28470 :  im a daddys girl

28471 :  what is getting in the way of my crucial moment

28472 :  and during those moments we found that this works for all addictions

28473 :  because this research is not just scientific

28474 :  im making light of this a little bit

28475 :  and they dont want it that way

28476 :  im not going to go out on break

28477 :  nobody wants it that way

28478 :  the vital behaviors are the ones connected to the result and carry a lot of other behaviors with it

28479 :  i made a plan to call my sister

28480 :  i am so cheap

28481 :  will you not invite me will you not make fun of me when i dont

28482 :  and the things that are good for you cost more money

28483 :  vital behavior is what we do

28484 :  and when she started saying

28485 :  i had to marshall enough of these influences

28486 :  what she said was

28487 :  but the real reason we might think that humans have pheromones is the change that occurs as we

28488 :  so we know that pheromones exist right the way across the animal kingdom

28489 :  and on these nerves exposed in the nose to the outside air are receptors and odor

28490 :  so do go forward and do search for more

28491 :  they have no smell at all and its only the wonderful bacteria growing on the rainforest of hair

28492 :  it works just as well underwater for goldfish and lobsters

28493 :  and it was only in one thousand nine hundred and fiftynine that a german team after spending twenty years in

28494 :  thank you very much

28495 :  as any dog owner can tell you we smell they smell

28496 :  well the first thing of course is that were mammals and mammals are smelly

28497 :  now smell was the hardest of the senses to crack and the nobel prize awarded to richard axel

28498 :  now this is a very attractive idea and the molecules they mention sound really

28499 :  he basically went through systematically showing that only the molecule in question was the one that

28500 :  its not about individual recognition

28501 :  and of course its puberty

28502 :  were mammals like everybody else whos a mammal and we probably do have them

28503 :  we produce a lot of smell

28504 :  there could be all sorts of things that humans are doing with pheromones that we simply dont know at the moment

28505 :  what benoist schaal and his team developed was a simple test to investigate what the effect of

28506 :  no matter how embarrassing we need to search and go for the first time where no one else has

28507 :  its a very interesting secretion

28508 :  any mother will do

28509 :  along with the pubic hair and the hair in the armpits new glands start to secrete in those

28510 :  what we need to remember is pheromones are not just about sex

28511 :  theres lots to find

28512 :  we worry more about how were judged and seen by others whether were regarded as attractive

28513 :  we spend a good bit of time

28514 :  it has lower taxes

28515 :  by the way were not pathologizing people to whom were talking about this

28516 :  its a computer program running in the brain

28517 :  its an illusion like sunsets

28518 :  you cant get rid of it

28519 :  so consciousness is an illusion

28520 :  you cant do this if you dont give a definition

28521 :  now what that tells us is that our traditional vocabularies for discussing these issues are

28522 :  people always say consciousness is very hard to define

28523 :  is that absolute like force and mass and gravitational attraction

28524 :  one consciousness does not exist

28525 :  i add two plus two to get four

28526 :  one and the same event has a level of description where its neurobiological and another level of

28527 :  two well maybe it exists but its really something else

28528 :  but we know that thats purely syntactical

28529 :  so the objection that you cant have an objective science of consciousness because its

28530 :  now why is that curious

28531 :  now i havent yet given you a definition

28532 :  im going to tell you how thats possible

28533 :  i wont demonstrate pain behavior but i can tell you im not having any pains right now

28534 :  youre giving up on three hundred years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it

28535 :  any hardware will do provided its rich enough and stable enough to carry the program

28536 :  or is it observer relative

28537 :  thats going on no matter what anybody thinks

28538 :  but we have this persistent confusion between objectivity and subjectivity as features of

28539 :  and the message i want to leave you with is consciousness has to become accepted as a

28540 :  and im going to go through some of them

28541 :  if youre not talking about that youre not talking about consciousness

28542 :  but when i haul out my pocket calculator and do the calculation the only intrinsic phenomenon

28543 :  how could spirituality move anything

28544 :  were not ready for a scientific definition but heres a common sense definition

28545 :  theres another tradition that thinks its opposed to this but accepts the worst assumption

28546 :  but for that distinction between how things consciously seem and how they really are you cant make that distinction for

28547 :  since we dont know how our brains do it were not in a position so far to build a conscious machine

28548 :  thats our target

28549 :  dreams are a form of consciousness on this definition

28550 :  its really a digital computer program running in your brain and thats what we need to do to create

28551 :  now thats the common sense definition

28552 :  and just as the jar full of water can go from liquid to solid depending on the behavior

28553 :  now whenever somebody tells me that i think you want to see spirituality move something

28554 :  so i dont just have the sight of the people in front of me and the sound of my voice and the weight of my shoes against the floor

28555 :  yeah forget about the hardware

28556 :  now that doesnt mean computation is arbitrary

28557 :  i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand but how is that possible

28558 :  maybe well be able to build a conscious machine

28559 :  you will experience drought

28560 :  one more analogy to the stock market

28561 :  now we can have a conversation about our differing values and how we should address this but the basic

28562 :  attitude matters ok

28563 :  they are made for everybody so its not allowed that any institution doesnt respect the rules

28564 :  what do you have

28565 :  mark says im an amateur photographer with a lot of kiss memorabilia

28566 :  hes well we need town council approval

28567 :  are you be interested in any of that

28568 :  ill trade you my worst snowmobile

28569 :  if you have a paperclip trade it away

28570 :  i was intrigued just by the idea of somebodys worst snowmobile

28571 :  hell probably have several mansions

28572 :  i really wanted to trade with him

28573 :  were improving each others lives albeit on a small scale

28574 :  hed easily trade you one of them

28575 :  and we met up one night

28576 :  his tour manager called me up and says were on tour in fargo north dakota

28577 :  i say alright if you can get it thatd be great

28578 :  half of its unrented

28579 :  what you need to do to make this happen

28580 :  but before i get started on that story i want to draw attention to this slide behind me

28581 :  turns out town council approval was getting two people to put their hand in the air

28582 :  but lets look at the worldwide trends

28583 :  and on that fateful day i scarfed down with tears my last pint of chocolate h agen dazs

28584 :  i dug out the magazine and i looked at it again

28585 :  i needed a lot more of that

28586 :  like life was a treadmill

28587 :  and it sparked something amazing within me because i started to see things i wouldnt

28588 :  thats why im here

28589 :  and this one day i hadnt taken my grateful photo for the day and i was scanning my life basically

28590 :  blah about life

28591 :  you had breakfast what did you do after that

28592 :  and she suddenly gave me that

28593 :  what she can produce are mostly vowel like sounds but thats enough for us to extract her source

28594 :  so thats the science behind what were doing

28595 :  we call this project vocalid or vocal i

28596 :  so i reached out to my collaborator tim bunnell

28597 :  but i thought there had to be a way to reverse engineer a voice from whatever

28598 :  i want you to take a listen to how they sound

28599 :  just recently became a hard cider maker

28600 :  so im doing it for them and they are doing it for me

28601 :  we are members of an invisible tribe

28602 :  im not happy

28603 :  so what you do with all that emotion is youve got to do something with it

28604 :  within the orbitofrontal cortex theres overlapping neural activity in response to

28605 :  another group similarly found automatic responses to beauty within our pleasure

28606 :  farmers markets are popping up in our community and ive only been there for a year and a half doing this type of

28607 :  they are taking it on

28608 :  it cant just stay with the kids

28609 :  considering i feel like im a pretty fun person

28610 :  so now is the time to work towards this paradigm shift that im talking about and

28611 :  were starting to create a farm to school network in the state and really helping these projects that were

28612 :  when can we eat that

28613 :  good food for oxford schools works in three different areas

28614 :  every morning when you wake up before a meeting were going to block one side of your nose and i want you to take ten breaths

28615 :  research into people with low back pain just four or five weeks of exercises similar to the ones im going to show

28616 :  in a world of im too sick

28617 :  im too sick

28618 :  im too old to try to jump that puddle

28619 :  ive read that the kidneys will actually move two three centimeters with a proper breath

28620 :  your blood pressure and heart rate are going to be jacked theyre going to be through the roof

28621 :  thats the fast track

28622 :  im too fat

28623 :  im not going to try to jump that

28624 :  eventually sure your immune system is going to go out of whack

28625 :  and it blew my mind

28626 :  and its causing us some problems

28627 :  the biology is telling you to eat more

28628 :  currently medical treatments are under development for patients like john so i hope to being able to help him

28629 :  we all know the white fat thats whats on your hips and your belly and thats unhealthy fat which is making you sick

28630 :  so when this signal is not adequately being provided to the brain you automatically eat more

28631 :  we dont know exactly whats causing what actually because this sugar rich food seem also to

28632 :  but it has been discovered a couple of years ago that as adults we also have brown fat

28633 :  so the solution here for obesity additional solutions may be to reduce your stress level

28634 :  it is leading to diseases like diabetes heart disease some forms of cancer

28635 :  she got frustrated

28636 :  but actually already is enough it has been shown that if you spend for a couple of weeks

28637 :  and thats even so in the long term

28638 :  so basically after a crash diet you are hungrier

28639 :  but that will also increase your appetite

28640 :  but there are other factors in our environment which affect the amount of food we eat

28641 :  it is now time to not longer judge people with obesity but to start

28642 :  and at some point she get referred to the erasmus medical center in rotterdam

28643 :  but still particularly obese people use more medication

28644 :  the reasons are simple

28645 :  she gained actually a lot of weight twenty pounds within ten weeks and she did not understand why

28646 :  at that point his mother put locks on all the kitchen cupboards but still he was craving

28647 :  they have a good chance of having a lot of brown fat there

28648 :  and thats the way we will combat obesity much more effectively

28649 :  and actually this is rare

28650 :  in particular the stress hormone cortisol if you are stressed for a prolonged period of time

28651 :  and remember your stress hormones increase your abdominal fat

28652 :  and then to discuss whether the dose can be reduced or the medication can maybe even stopped to make

28653 :  your biology is driven by your thinking

28654 :  abdominal fat mass will increase

28655 :  you can do it either by exercise which is hard if you are really massively obese but you can

28656 :  these people in my symbol obsessed twelve year old imagination these people who are strangling

28657 :  i believe that what we map changes the life we lead

28658 :  todays question is why

28659 :  you very rarely go to a place that isnt on your personal map

28660 :  and thats when learning really began for me

28661 :  its true that i had teachers that didnt give up on me and i was very fortunate to have those teachers because i often gave

28662 :  the way that we choose sort of our personal cartographic enterprise also shapes the

28663 :  it is a fake place

28664 :  they literally put nooses on themselves and then they went off to their jobs whatever they were

28665 :  so i was a really terrible student when i was a kid

28666 :  what is the process of cartography

28667 :  its about cartography

28668 :  its a paper town

28669 :  but the great thing about imagining learning as cartography instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump

28670 :  thats a terrible end

28671 :  and i said i dont know like six hours

28672 :  we made agloe new york up

28673 :  and because the youtube page is set up so that the page in which im talking to you is on the exact

28674 :  it was spotty it was inconsistent there was a lot i didnt know

28675 :  so i had one learning community in high school then i went to another for college and then i went to another when i

28676 :  and so i started to learn because learning was cool

28677 :  they exist in corners of the internet where old men fear to tread

28678 :  one shot or two inhaled by soft tissue stomped straight on another downsouth

28679 :  i really love poetry

28680 :  i started to look at little things at this cafe we could do to lessen our impact

28681 :  youre an alchemist

28682 :  you need the right amount of carbon which is the dead brown stuff

28683 :  we need to change that

28684 :  this makes sense

28685 :  they say do you add an outside heating element

28686 :  when you do that you create an environment for these microbes to thrive

28687 :  the right amount of oxygen and the right amount of moisture like a wrung out sponge

28688 :  theres a major issue in this country with waste at the source

28689 :  this is their a ha

28690 :  i went to compost school

28691 :  no you really dont

28692 :  we combine it with a carbon source mainly leaf waste

28693 :  we were doing it all by hand

28694 :  you have absolutely no way of knowing how to have this conversation unless you just make yourself do

28695 :  theyre a lot more likely to take medication which lowers their viral load which makes it less likely that theyll transmit the

28696 :  this is not something that your parents teach you how to talk about

28697 :  theyre a lot more likely to use condoms

28698 :  and stds cause weird discharge and bumps and herpes and warts

28699 :  its not shown in movies

28700 :  this is not something that your friends teach you how to talk about

28701 :  they died of aids

28702 :  and all of these things totally suck

28703 :  stds can cause infertility and do cause infertility in thousands of women every year

28704 :  and that would make sex more awesome for everybody

28705 :  are you will to love and accept

28706 :  we need to change that

28707 :  i want to perform

28708 :  josh thats a waste of your intellect

28709 :  you can be anything

28710 :  they all reacted exactly the same way

28711 :  i had a funny accent i had my nose in the books and i didnt know anyone

28712 :  things had come to a head and i was completely overwhelmed i reached out and i called an emergency helpline

28713 :  acting is a hobby not a job

28714 :  any laughing or ovation would encourage me

28715 :  it was in those moments that i spent with my fellow actors in the drama club that my pilot light began to burn its strongest

28716 :  it made me realize i could do what i loved

28717 :  then when i was sixteen my family moved to canada from south africa

28718 :  i could follow that light that shone inside me

28719 :  no one really knows

28720 :  and put them into one specific reel

28721 :  how do you do this

28722 :  and when were asked what the fourth dimension could be were usually met with the answer of it is time

28723 :  so following the same pattern if we were to integrate a 3d object we would get a fourth

28724 :  however how many of us actually know what such a thing means

28725 :  if we were to integrate a 3d object what do we get

28726 :  and lets say he does push out of the paper

28727 :  what would he have to do

28728 :  we commonly understand dimensions as a thing of the science fiction

28729 :  we can only theorize about this

28730 :  and if we were to integrate a 2d area on a 2d graph we would usually get the 3d volume under it

28731 :  the stickman figure

28732 :  youre not doing it now

28733 :  you should be working right now

28734 :  it is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is

28735 :  she would post them

28736 :  the media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume and we got as a

28737 :  we need employers to let go of outdated hiring practices and embrace new ways of identifying and

28738 :  and if youre a candidate dont wait for an employer to ask

28739 :  baseball was transformed when the cash strapped oakland athletics started recruiting players who didnt score highly on

28740 :  our clients are benefiting from eightyfive years of employment research which shows that work samples are one of the best

28741 :  the hiring systems we built in the 20th century are failing us and causing us to miss out on people with incredible

28742 :  what would be on your list for that magna carta

28743 :  i was i suppose the first user

28744 :  we are not there to stay

28745 :  where do i put my pigs

28746 :  so we are not in a city area were not inside a village but we are outside isolated

28747 :  so they asked us to do something on this site there was no brief

28748 :  and unclear of course

28749 :  only in a community you can support and sustain yourself

28750 :  as designers what we can do is create flexible spaces that can be used both as living and

28751 :  it is for the ten of the population of this world it is outdated

28752 :  so conventional architecture elements things that come to you every time you have a client and the brief comes in

28753 :  and even if we are able to find online criminals quite often there is no outcome

28754 :  nine million u

28755 :  and this really is something which creates completely new problems for us

28756 :  everything is reliant on these computers working

28757 :  for example the elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these

28758 :  jain and that bank account had fourteen
28759 :  the pc virus problem is twentyfive years old now

28760 :  wow you can do that on accordion

28761 :  itll work for probably a century

28762 :  things almost didnt work out

28763 :  it works for decades

28764 :  its much like on a jet

28765 :  i work a lot

28766 :  a wine label

28767 :  thank you guys so much

28768 :  but i dont know anything about wine

28769 :  but there is more to it

28770 :  and thats the basis on which you decide whom to vote for but after having finished your birthday cake

28771 :  kind regards bea

28772 :  it simply cannot be campaign day every day

28773 :  what are the mechanisms that allow people to survive

28774 :  and you say i love you your wife loves you your mother loves you

28775 :  and he had the cingulotomy and it was incredibly successful

28776 :  you can answer that one pretty readily at least for most people

28777 :  and i get letters i get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about whats worked for them

28778 :  im crying now as i write to you

28779 :  someone was asking me backstage today about meditation

28780 :  and i said why not

28781 :  people will say no one loves me

28782 :  its just too implausible

28783 :  you dont think in depression that youve put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze

28784 :  and so i went out to try to look at what was being done for poor people with depression

28785 :  things are different because now i know that depression is the family secret that everyone

28786 :  i have nothing to say to my children

28787 :  those are the things that i feel sad about now

28788 :  the depressive group was usually accurate to within about ten percent and the non depressed people guessed

28789 :  and i went out and i interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression

28790 :  and what i came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience and say i was

28791 :  those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience

28792 :  and so we have an epidemic in this country of depression among impoverished people

28793 :  they didnt externalize the depression as an invasive spirit

28794 :  is something that happens when that system gets broken

28795 :  so frank russakoff said to me if i had a do over i suppose i wouldnt do it this way but in a

28796 :  and there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who

28797 :  then he would have a week of going downhill

28798 :  there is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us that treatment of

28799 :  hes really the kind of guy to whom this wouldnt make any sense so you know its just between us

28800 :  that have something in common with what youre describing

28801 :  and i couldnt figure out which it was

28802 :  hes now a friend of mine

28803 :  and so i found an academic who was doing a research project in slums outside of d

28804 :  then he would feel okay for a week

28805 :  he was when i met him at a point at which every month he would have electroshock treatment

28806 :  and yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life but feel miserable all the time you think why do i feel

28807 :  then he would feel sort of disoriented for a week

28808 :  and then he would have another electroshock treatment

28809 :  and i said yes thats fine

28810 :  what is the mechanism of resilience

28811 :  i must have depression

28812 :  as i unwrapped it i began to cry and my mother came over and said are you crying because of

28813 :  its not that im so sad but i get overwhelmed i think because i could have killed myself but my

28814 :  could you imagine how i felt in that moment

28815 :  last year alone we treated in israel two hundred and seven thousand people

28816 :  and he saved my father

28817 :  i was seventeen years old

28818 :  he was on coumadin

28819 :  he could have saved this child

28820 :  and so i started thinking about this problem this very very challenging problem elements that behave very very

28821 :  fuel rod assembly is only about this big

28822 :  we know what carbon dioxide is doing we know how it is globally changing our

28823 :  and immediately thought about hydro electric

28824 :  its not new but it is a step in history and its as difficult as it was to

28825 :  we have to renew it

28826 :  thats the principle so there are many details

28827 :  but its a more equal floor

28828 :  and ask yourself

28829 :  we have a few weeks time to discuss later

28830 :  no its understandable

28831 :  an unconditional basic income creates a huge incentive to create better work

28832 :  how many people want it

28833 :  and so each time i had a worrying upsetting negative thought i forced myself to concentrate on

28834 :  i woke up the next morning

28835 :  i was in the grips of real loneliness back then but i was surrounded by people all day so it

28836 :  just shake it off its all in your head

28837 :  he was standing on a stool by the sink brushing his teeth when he slipped and scratched his

28838 :  he had visible tumors all over his body

28839 :  now adults get tricked this way as well all the time

28840 :  he cried for a minute but then he got back up got back on the stool and reached out for a box of

28841 :  i recently was at a friends house and their five year old was getting ready for bed

28842 :  during that time in the 70s and 80s it was claimed to have one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world

28843 :  over five hundred police officers were killed

28844 :  and help us feel happier

28845 :  everyone has the right to go to a park

28846 :  what if only smokestacks and cranes fill your sky

28847 :  parks are one of the true democratic spaces in our cities

28848 :  imagine youre walking down the street with your friend

28849 :  because so what

28850 :  you did this trick

28851 :  i gave you something you needed that you wanted that you didnt really even think was possible

28852 :  and thats what we try to do with magic

28853 :  why do you forget

28854 :  and the ham sandwich is best explained as as a story or an example

28855 :  im going to change the situation a little bit

28856 :  it could be the most amazing thing ever

28857 :  you go home and put it on instagram twitter facebook

28858 :  i snap my fingers and you reach inside your pocket

28859 :  imagine you pulled out this sandwich

28860 :  so in magic we call this the ham sandwich

28861 :  its just acceptable that play is a good thing

28862 :  so i got inspired by that

28863 :  the next project i want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger

28864 :  so it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this

28865 :  and her reaction inspired me to do a second annual no pants subway ride

28866 :  and were never given a reason why we should play

28867 :  and you know not everybodys going to like everything you do and ive certainly developed a thick skin thanks to internet comments but

28868 :  and they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags

28869 :  and weve continued to do it every year

28870 :  we dont need a reason

28871 :  its a prank but its a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell

28872 :  one thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras

28873 :  but she has nothing more to give you

28874 :  but do not hurry the voyage at all

28875 :  there is number one

28876 :  we have two choices then

28877 :  are you going to become a superstar

28878 :  and so for musicians what do we have

28879 :  theres too much preparation

28880 :  now in our company this is what we call the pinky suck moment

28881 :  this is a pulse of light thats only about one wavelength of light long so its a whole bunch of photons all

28882 :  have you thought am i coming back

28883 :  dont live in the past live in the present and dont make the same mistakes in the future

28884 :  they said oh my god were so glad shes pregnant

28885 :  so for me ive always felt like i loved that feeling and obviously i dont

28886 :  and i stopped lifting weights

28887 :  shes tall shes fast she hits hard like me she serves like me

28888 :  were you afraid

28889 :  but it was a good moment

28890 :  but then after i won the us open i realized that my body helped me reach goals that i wanted to reach and

28891 :  ive been a pro for almost twenty years and so for me its really important to hold women up and its something that these young women theyll come

28892 :  but then you always have these cranky yankees

28893 :  your body brings men and women to their knees

28894 :  when you heard the news were you excited

28895 :  so i did that and i felt that to be the best and if you want to be the best you have to hang

28896 :  will i take some time off

28897 :  i love my freedom

28898 :  it was better in person i promise

28899 :  i didnt like it

28900 :  because now little girls are looking at you saying i want to be like that

28901 :  im always healthy

28902 :  and i was just laughing at her

28903 :  the only reason i am who i am is because of my losses and some of them are extremely painful but

28904 :  im really inspired by my sister

28905 :  i was like im not going to do this

28906 :  their stories resonate deep inside of me and im reassured that we arent so alone in this world

28907 :  i didnt allow them to know

28908 :  as you know its not going to turn out well

28909 :  this is what politics looks like today

28910 :  so i thought you know what im going to start with connection

28911 :  she said whats going on

28912 :  our job is to look and say you know what

28913 :  and she said whats the struggle

28914 :  and i thought well whats the struggle

28915 :  and maybe stories are just data with a soul

28916 :  can i be this fierce about this

28917 :  and she said but the thing i liked about your talk is youre a storyteller

28918 :  well apparently this is the way my work went as well because when you ask people about love

28919 :  let me tell you something you know who you are when you call your friends and say i think i need to see somebody

28920 :  and the first words that came to my mind were whole hearted

28921 :  and she called and she said im really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer

28922 :  heres vulnerability heres grief heres shame heres fear heres disappointment

28923 :  i have a slight office supply addiction but thats another talk

28924 :  and i said but heres the thing no family stuff no childhood shit

28925 :  im a qualitative researcher

28926 :  theres no discourse anymore

28927 :  why do we struggle with it so much

28928 :  and it took about a year

28929 :  and i know thats knowing laughter

28930 :  and so then i went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they the whole

28931 :  you cannot selectively numb

28932 :  they just talked about it being necessary

28933 :  you know how blame is described in the research

28934 :  can i believe in this this passionately

28935 :  its not that we dont want to feel something emotionally

28936 :  we want the whole range of feelings

28937 :  thats what we want to get away from

28938 :  i went from driving on the left side to driving on the right

28939 :  im going to tell you my story

28940 :  get comfortable with being uncomfortable

28941 :  as a result they are preventing the onset of skin cancer without affecting any of the surrounding tissue

28942 :  on the other hand skin cancer cells because they grow so rapidly and consume so much energy

28943 :  i wanted to see what would physically happen to these cells if i were to remove this mcat

28944 :  what other factors affect skin development

28945 :  thats what the data says

28946 :  but we can actually drill down further

28947 :  the second thing to notice

28948 :  using fifty different indicators we bring together all these different factors to create a score for a

28949 :  but is happiness really what it means to be a good society

28950 :  it seems that the basic education schooling system is not performing as well as it should be

28951 :  thats basic human needs

28952 :  by the way analysing the data we see a very strong relationship between

28953 :  every region is underperforming there

28954 :  its good to be happy but happiness is not a complete measure of a good society

28955 :  internet mobile phones etc

28956 :  gdp has nothing to say about the environment

28957 :  again thats an interesting finding

28958 :  if i was afraid i went to more dangerous places

28959 :  it was invincible

28960 :  i know that the abscess that grew around my wound after the operation the

28961 :  i was greedy

28962 :  and i said but whats the water part

28963 :  and she sang i mean her whole body sang

28964 :  it had no limits

28965 :  i worried that if i took my hat off i wouldnt be here anymore

28966 :  if i was tired i drank more espressos

28967 :  i took more than my body had to offer

28968 :  me was a floating head

28969 :  my body was often in the way

28970 :  i began to see my body like an ipad or a car

28971 :  it was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms

28972 :  oh sure sure i had moments of appreciation of my body the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of

28973 :  and the other women sang and they prayed for me and my mother

28974 :  it was the realization that i had come very close to dying in the same way that

28975 :  it was my head that was bald and comfortable now without a hat

28976 :  it was the continuing devastating war in the congo and the indifference of the world

28977 :  it was all these things

28978 :  i heard stories that got inside my body

28979 :  and this is possible

28980 :  we slowed down

28981 :  when we were flying over the sahara and india it was nice holidays

28982 :  what do you really want

28983 :  you need sixtyfour meter wingspan

28984 :  thats the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking

28985 :  we fly twice the speed you predicted

28986 :  you know with the technologies we have today we can save between thirty and fifty percent of the energy of a

28987 :  throwing overboard as ballast to change our direction

28988 :  and he started to follow his special about the photography

28989 :  it must be good for me

28990 :  in what quantity

28991 :  you dont know how it was stored their stability issues

28992 :  first of all

28993 :  and natural doesnt always mean something is healthy

28994 :  let me give you an interesting example

28995 :  its probably also healthy

28996 :  which class did i belong to then

28997 :  honestly i couldnt remember what he said but one of the words he mentioned grabbed my attention and that word was

28998 :  your dietary failures may not be your fault

28999 :  for hundred of years we know that bacteria live within our body

29000 :  the overall algorithm combined tens of thousands of such rules that it automatically deduced from the data

29001 :  others have opinions on how much sugar we should eat or how much salt cholesterol saturated

29002 :  or in other words what room in my house

29003 :  theres now a new research project underway at the karolinska in sweden to prove that hypothesis

29004 :  well see two cells in the upper part of the screen

29005 :  thats why youre all in your chairs

29006 :  they float freely in three dimensions without any forces acting on them

29007 :  im going to force my way through the amazon forest

29008 :  it s a story about all of us

29009 :  and after reading the the alchemist i decided to buy a plane ticket to ethiopia

29010 :  but also you have to take a step

29011 :  this might sound crazy it sounds crazy to me

29012 :  and how much i wanted to go there since i was seventeen years old

29013 :  if two packs of equal size meet the pack with the old wolf wins two
29014 :  so i assembled a top notch leadership team who believed in the possibility of all the children

29015 :  what are we gonna do about it

29016 :  i was not going to stay in my office i was not going to delegate my work and i

29017 :  what can we do here

29018 :  why are bees doing better in the city

29019 :  this is a big question now to help us understand why they should be in the city

29020 :  paris has been a terrific model for urban beekeeping

29021 :  a bee isnt going to sting you if you see it

29022 :  again a bit counterintuitive

29023 :  we have huge grand challenges these days of habitat loss

29024 :  the bees just arent around anymore

29025 :  and colony collapse disorder is not the only thing affecting honeybees

29026 :  we have also some images of honey from brooklyn

29027 :  why dont we think about honeybees in that same type of way

29028 :  i understand that

29029 :  i got my ph

29030 :  this is called colony collapse disorder and its bizarre

29031 :  we exercise we eat healthy we take vitamins

29032 :  its a little bit like archery

29033 :  we experience what she called the choice overload problem

29034 :  i woke up in intensive care and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that

29035 :  they cut me literally cut me in half

29036 :  i had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head and i saw my world through a mirror that was suspended

29037 :  and i said what

29038 :  my head was cut open across the front lifted back exposing the skull underneath

29039 :  i broke my collarbone

29040 :  then they stitched me up they took an entire hour to stitch me up

29041 :  they took out two of my broken ribs and they rebuilt my back l1 they rebuilt it they took out

29042 :  i had one arm in plaster one arm tied down by drips

29043 :  i had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots

29044 :  i broke some bones in my feet

29045 :  is that a problem

29046 :  youll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life

29047 :  i wanted my old life back

29048 :  i broke my right arm

29049 :  youre in a wheelchair

29050 :  i was no longer tied to a set path

29051 :  i said well i have to get a friend to drive me because i cant drive

29052 :  and then i thought why stop there

29053 :  i had no movement in my legs

29054 :  it just drops them the shortest distance possible to the forest floor where theyre actually

29055 :  in this case weve grown a corner block

29056 :  this is crazy

29057 :  theyre not biologically compatible

29058 :  you dont need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility

29059 :  they can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing and its going to improve the local soil

29060 :  second of all we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials

29061 :  and this isnt just found in packaging

29062 :  she goes home and she sees her mother and mother gives her a great hug and says debbie youre wonderful your grandfather would

29063 :  we have to try that

29064 :  i think most people dont want to be dead

29065 :  these are the four ways to go

29066 :  and intensive care has something to do with that

29067 :  in the us its one in five
29068 :  this has been a ride man this has been fantastic

29069 :  we made a video game thats hard to play

29070 :  unspeakably hard at times but it was also pure hope

29071 :  i never planned to write video games but these moments that really change our lives they often come as the

29072 :  but whats beginning to happen is because these geeks are all getting together because they are highly qualified for

29073 :  he was darwins cousin

29074 :  that was partly based on francis galtons work

29075 :  and you got it wrong

29076 :  compliance audits consultants diagnostics

29077 :  we are constantly trying to put accountability in someones hands

29078 :  they are the favorite team to win

29079 :  we will know who to blame

29080 :  from eightythree to ninetyfive two percent per annum

29081 :  you know this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a

29082 :  and this year the us team is in great shape

29083 :  it will come at the expense of your measurable speed

29084 :  they make human efforts derail

29085 :  we need somebody accountable for this process

29086 :  but business has become much more complex

29087 :  the first for those in the room that may be over twentyfive maybe thirty this is what networking looks like

29088 :  one of those individuals is a network scientist by the name of ron burt

29089 :  what ron came to find was that networks and peoples success is defined by

29090 :  we have those same individuals here

29091 :  i like to think of my life as how can i spread warmth and generosity to each and every person that i meet in

29092 :  they were flying under the radar

29093 :  and i would say with confidence we do have roads and we have internet in omaha nebraska

29094 :  sound like one morning i could wake up and see my son as a repeat of last weeks story

29095 :  because even when you go to get the job in some certain workplace they say

29096 :  we dont want females we want males

29097 :  but then when you go to the workforce you find that there are less girls

29098 :  the males answers were decisive

29099 :  her mother says

29100 :  and i thought why dont people want to achieve their dreams

29101 :  they can actually reach university level

29102 :  the 1st question

29103 :  it does make sense this is a logical snack

29104 :  and they ask a series of really interesting questions

29105 :  or are there more systematic factors at work

29106 :  but yeah whats the matter with arkansas

29107 :  that was john kerrys home state

29108 :  racism is predictable

29109 :  he lost badly but every democrat does

29110 :  on average women make less ambitious offers and gets worse outcomes than

29111 :  we have very little leeway

29112 :  this is so powerful

29113 :  the problem is when our range narrows that produces something called the low power

29114 :  lets do a little experiment

29115 :  the answers are always the same

29116 :  when my niece was four she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything

29117 :  or sometimes being new to a country like an immigrant or new to an organization or new to an experience

29118 :  but sometimes were too weak

29119 :  they smiled a big beaming smile

29120 :  when other people see me as powerful they grant me a wider range

29121 :  but heres the problem

29122 :  how do we do that

29123 :  i want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brothers wedding

29124 :  power comes in lots of forms

29125 :  okay that pant

29126 :  but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered theres one situation where women get the same

29127 :  what if i gave my daughter a choice

29128 :  through these experiences ive come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable

29129 :  thereve been multiple times in my life where i have been forewarned that a low power person has been

29130 :  this pant or that pant

29131 :  this shirt or that shirt

29132 :  my eyes lit up

29133 :  okay that shirt

29134 :  one of the ways is to be a mama bear

29135 :  they become more assertive

29136 :  i took their perspective i became more invested in their cause i became more committed to them because

29137 :  their eyes lit up and got big

29138 :  and thats because suicide is a public health concern not a criminal one

29139 :  well thats not acceptable anymore

29140 :  these are the factors which create that bubble which surrounds us that is our perceptual field our

29141 :  i just took a deep breath

29142 :  so i stayed like that for a while

29143 :  when our first nations inuit and mantis communities are being ravaged by a suicide rate five six
29144 :  and this is how i do it

29145 :  i heard the guidance counselor ask from across the room miles away it seemed like he said mark

29146 :  i left them everywhere in cafes and in libraries at the u

29147 :  find me when you can

29148 :  or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters around her campus in dubuque iowa only to

29149 :  where is all of this money going

29150 :  because his theory was

29151 :  whats the problem

29152 :  and the whole idea behind students first is a simple one and it is that

29153 :  and let me tell you why

29154 :  is that really right

29155 :  so thats exactly what students first aims to try to do is balance that equation out and make sure that we have

29156 :  so ive been talking courses

29157 :  not psychology biology

29158 :  he wanted to be rich and he wanted to be famous

29159 :  he was in pursuit of the riches

29160 :  its always a result

29161 :  and by why i dont mean to make a profit

29162 :  they have the same access to the same talent the same agencies the same consultants the same media

29163 :  money was no problem

29164 :  thats a result

29165 :  i believe i believe i believe he told people

29166 :  the best we can muster up is i dont know

29167 :  thats how we describe them right

29168 :  and its the complete opposite to everyone else

29169 :  as we said before the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions

29170 :  thats like that gut feeling oh they just get it

29171 :  everybody was trying it

29172 :  its what they believed about america that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in

29173 :  it just doesnt feel right

29174 :  this technique will bring you there

29175 :  but then i read the ted guidelines and they said we are looking for speakers to share deep

29176 :  i was visiting this school in may as a local school board member im a former liberal

29177 :  am i going to talk about my research my postdoc

29178 :  i got into it very surprisingly and very involuntarily

29179 :  my story is personal but its also political

29180 :  what am i going to talk about

29181 :  there was a second grade class who had brand new ipads and we politicians

29182 :  this is such a beautiful concept

29183 :  its not political merely because its personal i think it would be political anyway

29184 :  i know this is stuff you arent supposed to say in this country where everyone learns everything and all the people are friends with

29185 :  im a feminist like i told you and i think personal is political

29186 :  not because i regret anything of what i wrote and said not because i felt or feel

29187 :  we have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where theyre moving

29188 :  so they are absolutely ready to go

29189 :  weve got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them

29190 :  and that was just luck

29191 :  if we start now we can be ready for the next epidemic

29192 :  the last time a germ game was done in the united states was back in two thousand and one and it didnt go so well

29193 :  the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like ebola or it could be bioterrorism

29194 :  no one to look at the diagnostics

29195 :  and then they become tadpoles and frogs

29196 :  she goes what about dogs

29197 :  would that ever happen

29198 :  like how do they know thats the time

29199 :  humans are so private

29200 :  i didnt know it would happen so quick at eight

29201 :  these are not just global challenges but interconnected urban ones and theyre going to be massively amplified and

29202 :  everything from infrastructure to our water supply everything from our diet

29203 :  its like helping a friend

29204 :  and i thought we all have problems and thats ok

29205 :  so i did it and to be honest in the beginning i was scared i was scared of the reaction of other people

29206 :  they met each other online but some of them also met each other offline and made friends

29207 :  and i know it can be hard to imagine that

29208 :  i have a lot of followers to be honest

29209 :  then you also need to do that

29210 :  well this is vlogging

29211 :  im so proud of you please dont give up

29212 :  you only see a number but behind that number there are people with real faces real feelings and real

29213 :  they help me but i also help them

29214 :  i do this very often

29215 :  you cant say

29216 :  it says that its estimated that of your working age population of people with a disability that are

29217 :  so ill ask the question

29218 :  its to train and develop

29219 :  do you know why

29220 :  and then move on to the next step

29221 :  well listen here is the problem

29222 :  you know where it was highly technical and it required enormous planning

29223 :  this is really cool

29224 :  nobody had ever looked inside the wreck

29225 :  there is no fame in it

29226 :  we barely break even

29227 :  so you know merging the two passions

29228 :  i could draw

29229 :  dear miss fastdriver we would like to remind you to pay your fine for excess speed

29230 :  it is potentially disruptive for our own understanding of our own being but also for our understanding of

29231 :  whats the goal

29232 :  probably you are

29233 :  and what about ethical issues

29234 :  we tend to stick to a predetermined position and that means that default

29235 :  psychology but also behavioural economics and some aspects from

29236 :  thats what generates revenue

29237 :  it doesnt cost much to implement them

29238 :  most of these applications are cheap

29239 :  you choose to become one

29240 :  more and more countries around the world are getting very interested in such an approach

29241 :  perhaps you do

29242 :  if not i have another illustration for you

29243 :  we are becoming aware of this and the bottom line is that no neutral design

29244 :  this is becoming even more interesting today

29245 :  the appeal is clear

29246 :  what do you mean epidemic

29247 :  everybody was happy

29248 :  who is infecting other people

29249 :  and theres special workers for doing that

29250 :  and some of them many of them actually had water that came into more than one room

29251 :  it may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live saving bone marrow donors

29252 :  you all know about embryonic stem cells

29253 :  theyve got great potential but havent yet entered clinical trials

29254 :  hands it back to me

29255 :  i didnt even ask him one single question

29256 :  i had now spent four months in the hospital

29257 :  i just didnt want to die

29258 :  at this point i had no power to make the big changes

29259 :  dying didnt scare me

29260 :  i was jumping with a camera on my helmet filming the others

29261 :  i hope someday we can help out the undocumented kids

29262 :  there were lawsuits it was a lot of pain

29263 :  wasnt very flattering i can tell you that

29264 :  with all that success all the sudden im unemployed

29265 :  some of you from the west coast may remember it used to be a big oil and gas firm and refinery

29266 :  well get better at things we do

29267 :  we need to keep pushing that up and we will push it up

29268 :  today though you know we kept it up

29269 :  managers there were afraid of failure

29270 :  i used to work for a big company called unical

29271 :  we have a foundation that we give money away

29272 :  so i did it

29273 :  you might wonder what i did once i escaped

29274 :  regardless when we reveal our authentic selves we create a trusting world a world where it feels

29275 :  what i realized was that denying the dark parts of my history i was suppressing a part of me that mattered and a part that

29276 :  think about that

29277 :  so i quietly lived in my car in my shame and then lived in my shame for years

29278 :  you become a member of a group that has truly survived

29279 :  i was trying to escape him and here he was laughing at my stupidity shouting obscenities at

29280 :  we help victims become survivors and our community can respond to our needs in a profound

29281 :  see its that youre like me moment a moment of connection of empathy of acknowledgment of a

29282 :  what happened after my speech that day was the ones like me came out of the woodwork

29283 :  you could have lived with us

29284 :  that was my first moment of authenticity about my past

29285 :  but it wasnt that time

29286 :  i was a work in progress not to be held to the timeline of someone elses accomplishment

29287 :  valerie i am sorry but do you mind swapping chairs i am not comfortable sitting in this angle from the main entrance

29288 :  why is it that the relationship in china is so important

29289 :  that does sound like that would crack the np complete problems or whatever else

29290 :  for np complete problems quantum computers seem to give you some advantage like

29291 :  of course but in some sense thats the more exciting possibility

29292 :  because thats the possibility that means that we have to rewrite all the physics textbooks

29293 :  but finding the answer might require an astronomical search

29294 :  so factoring also would only take about n squared steps for an n digit number

29295 :  but where do those limits come from

29296 :  now fifty cubits is probably not enough yet to do anything

29297 :  well why isnt that just a fancy pompous way of saying the cat is either alive

29298 :  thats the set of all the problems for which a digital computer could at least quickly recognize an

29299 :  the trouble is it is not that simple

29300 :  what a quantum computer would do is put factoring into that easy class

29301 :  if you just wanted a random answer then you could have picked one yourself with a lot

29302 :  i hope youre familiar with the crunch of an ocean punched into your jaw

29303 :  which is to say you should be afraid

29304 :  a legacy of women with open mouths and rigid spines

29305 :  it is hard to be powerful when you are constantly bending your bones into more swallowable shapes

29306 :  the slam of metal a poor substitute for bone and my sister does what all girls know how to do which is to

29307 :  like they took all of the wicked out of my witch

29308 :  and you can imagine a lot more applications

29309 :  the problem is though that i wanted to explain to you how this really works but i can have four of these on my finger

29310 :  so to begin with focal glow

29311 :  its not going to change overnight

29312 :  how smart we are

29313 :  step one discovered truth

29314 :  how skinny we are

29315 :  whos defining who you are and how do we define ourselves

29316 :  you go out and start changing those things

29317 :  whats step three

29318 :  the last step is maybe the most critical of all

29319 :  the girlfriend boyfriend we have

29320 :  its going to take time its going to require multiple attempts of trying to overcome things

29321 :  one day i refused to let her do that to me

29322 :  see we get the principal of change backwards because if youre not dialed into your potential to who you are good

29323 :  we want to know about dynamic things going around

29324 :  i work ten hours a day i commute two hours a day

29325 :  all of my relationships have failed

29326 :  its totally dominated by work

29327 :  walk the dog

29328 :  moreover i think it can transform society

29329 :  you want me to go to church and call my mother

29330 :  up until that moment i had been that classic corporate warrior i was eating too much i was drinking too much i

29331 :  its up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of

29332 :  he was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help

29333 :  and it means that people like many of us who have run organizations and gone out of our way to

29334 :  and she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science the emerging field of

29335 :  he said my job is to prove dr

29336 :  he saw his job as creating conflict around her theories

29337 :  did they eat fish and chips

29338 :  everything is context

29339 :  referents in reference to using pronouns but for now her invention was

29340 :  did it hurt

29341 :  in the next moment i recognized that this third grader was from a spanish speaking family

29342 :  we have to try that

29343 :  we tested a lot of specimens there and then the government they actually saw our results

29344 :  and in principle thats a very good thing

29345 :  the amount of information that organizations can gather about you and how they can use it to influence you in a way that you will not

29346 :  i have taken part in expeditions throughout the baltic sea

29347 :  i believe we can change it for the better

29348 :  well heck yeah it does

29349 :  i can move my head

29350 :  hes an audio engineer

29351 :  we have something called the vestibulo ocular reflex to track things with our eyes like this

29352 :  you can do that

29353 :  i can track you

29354 :  weve also been lucky to have people like brandi chastain the womens soccer icon nascars dale earnhardt jr

29355 :  but if you do get the permission of his next of kin i will release the brain to you

29356 :  and then i realized i had to figure out who his next of kin was and ask them and it turned out it was andre waterss eightyeight year old

29357 :  he was known for leading with his head so i thought im just going to look up did he ever talk about the concussions he had

29358 :  former philadelphia eagles strong safety fortyfour years old a division ii football coach when he decided to put a

29359 :  we want to know why he changed so much in the last five years of his life

29360 :  and it turned out they both had it

29361 :  we see chaos occur at times in business mergers natural disasters and horrific events like nine eleven
29362 :  and while this goldfish lives in a very safe environment its also very limiting in most every way

29363 :  genius hour is based on googles twenty policy where kids will actually get one hour a

29364 :  but guess what

29365 :  in my classroom i like to use a student teaching student model

29366 :  if you move at all while were taking the picture all we see is a blur

29367 :  i study human brain development because i want to understand how the human mind is built and maybe be able to help fix

29368 :  now human babies are a hard population to study at the best of times

29369 :  so i suggest that if we want to understand the human mind we have to start at the beginning and study the brains of babies

29370 :  but i did them differently in my unique way

29371 :  am i just going to

29372 :  i was shaking

29373 :  that was my dream

29374 :  i practiced like crazy

29375 :  second hard work

29376 :  so they didnt know who i was

29377 :  i went to holland i went to denmark

29378 :  in my years toiling away in labs and in peoples backyards investigating and cataloging the

29379 :  he marched the soldiers down to the local railway station and they traveled all the way to k penick which is a town

29380 :  what hed done is eventually confiscated four thousand marks as part of the trial as evidence in the trial and then

29381 :  emboldened by this he hatched what probably remains i think one of the ballsiest criminal

29382 :  presumably it just lays so far outside the realm of this guys imagination that a soldier in the british

29383 :  and in some ways thats not entirely surprising

29384 :  some people would say yes and some people would say no

29385 :  we do live in a world which is overly impressed by superficial characteristics like your title or your

29386 :  so it deepens the anxiety

29387 :  all of us strive to disguise our flaws in the eyes of other people

29388 :  we are going to do it

29389 :  i know its possible

29390 :  its a big challenge and what is our response to it

29391 :  as you might imagine this percentage is even lower for vegans

29392 :  but what is a person who eats less meat

29393 :  you could say

29394 :  we also know perhaps most morally salient that due to factory farming animals

29395 :  well weve all had that conversation before

29396 :  i bet many of you here today are already reducitarians

29397 :  so whatever it is about words like flexitarian and vegan we know they conjure entirely

29398 :  sometimes i eat meat and sometimes i dont

29399 :  once in a while we would go out to eat id order bacon with my eggs and pancakes and they

29400 :  i could do a lot more

29401 :  that is a double whammy no one wants to experience with their morning coffee

29402 :  we enjoyed each other

29403 :  im not trying to be funny

29404 :  we havent had sex in six weeks

29405 :  women do not have a corner on the low libido market

29406 :  i had a great orgasm

29407 :  he needs to recognize that those things will turn her on

29408 :  sex is a powerful way of connecting and bonding with somebody you love

29409 :  and she promised she would do better

29410 :  the first is desire

29411 :  im not just talking about the couples in my practice

29412 :  the third stage

29413 :  imagine i were to stroke your childs arm with this feather and their brain was telling them that they were

29414 :  the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow

29415 :  in fact imagine something even worse

29416 :  imagine if you will these two ideas together

29417 :  and when you turn the switch on the light goes on

29418 :  imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was

29419 :  now what does it have to do with chronic pain

29420 :  and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others

29421 :  its the people who define the city

29422 :  what are streets

29423 :  as we speak there are cities in the netherlands who are installing rain sensors on their bicycle traffic lights so that when it rains

29424 :  but id like to put the next fifteen minutes or so into perspective for you and im going to need your help for that

29425 :  thats how designing cities for people should be

29426 :  it doesnt matter how hilly how hot how cold citizen cyclists will ride seduced by the good design the

29427 :  firstly we have to look at the streets themselves

29428 :  that human being on the other end of the design process is everything

29429 :  seriously cities around the world cant put in a simple decent cycle track or widen the sidewalks traffic calm a

29430 :  now a lot of people seem to have this perception that streets are the exclusive domain of automobiles

29431 :  one is basic human observation something we all share

29432 :  i think theres a pretty good chance its going to work again

29433 :  lulu sophia has a brother his names felix hes ten
29434 :  shouldnt we study their behavior their patterns their movements their desires their needs in order to figure

29435 :  good design can also improve human behavior

29436 :  a designer thinks about the end user of the product

29437 :  simple rational logical

29438 :  why are cars silly

29439 :  physio socio pshyco ideal pleasure in everything they do

29440 :  in copenhagen in the morning rush hour when a couple hundred thousand people ride their bikes to work its different

29441 :  the glass roofs were a funny idea but you know what

29442 :  if you think about it it worked for about seven thousand years

29443 :  this is financial literacy

29444 :  i said why not

29445 :  then they are turning pro

29446 :  thats kind of interesting

29447 :  were just little people in many ways

29448 :  the reason i can borrow hundreds of millions of dollars

29449 :  thats a lie

29450 :  i went home and asked dad i said hey dad

29451 :  when i was nine years old i crossed and went to my rich dads office being an entrepreneur he started teaching his

29452 :  so all over the world today i asked what dr

29453 :  went to stanford the university of chicago northwestern

29454 :  how do you understand numbers

29455 :  they bailed out the rich

29456 :  i said i dont want a job

29457 :  you cant learn to ride a bicycle until you fall off the bicycle

29458 :  so a person has got to find a place to make mistakes

29459 :  but it was a great learning experience

29460 :  you make mistakes youre considered stupid

29461 :  now you have to go to school to be a doctor a lawyer an engineer but you dont have to go to school to be rich

29462 :  they dont even know what it is when they leave school even college graduates

29463 :  every time you say you cant afford it and you say im a poor im a loser i cant do something im helpless the government should take

29464 :  did any of those prototype spacecraft fail

29465 :  supervised practice quit attempts so that the person will have a sense of what its like when they quit smoking for real

29466 :  were examining the performance of these fifteen components in a set of three
29467 :  counseling offered across the entire quitting process in person and possibly over the

29468 :  and yet we have not been working programmatically toward better and better and better behavioral

29469 :  what if we started using engineering approaches to develop behavioral interventions

29470 :  so for example a behavioral intervention for smoking cessation might include pre cessation

29471 :  and perhaps even more disturbing the equivalent of the undergraduate population here at university park

29472 :  only when they had a set of components where they understood the operation of the components really well they were

29473 :  now lets think about that for a second

29474 :  and either way were left without knowing what are the steps we need to take so that the next intervention we

29475 :  if it turns out that the intervention that the intervention failed it didnt work we dont know why it didnt work

29476 :  and think about that its not just the freshman not just the sophomores and not just one year but

29477 :  the idea is to just to keep getting better and better and better

29478 :  because i remember my fathers reaction to the report

29479 :  he quit smoking as a result of reading that report and so did many other people

29480 :  not only worldwide but just here in the united states

29481 :  these experiments are taking place in ordinary healthcare settings where you might go if you needed a routine

29482 :  or better in some other incremental way

29483 :  things are different now of course many fewer people smoke

29484 :  our hope is that after weve developed this behavioral intervention the work of others and possibly our future

29485 :  i think we can if we take a page from nasas book and engineer behavioral interventions

29486 :  whats the problem with that approach

29487 :  were in the process of analyzing it now

29488 :  all this would do is wreck a family

29489 :  he was busted in a drug sweep

29490 :  then he lost his job

29491 :  now consider ms

29492 :  they didnt make loans and then sell the loans

29493 :  and most important a wise person does this improvising and rule bending in the service of the right aims

29494 :  wise people know how to improvise

29495 :  so its just a question of waiting for the next one and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid as not to

29496 :  so the patients are not organ systems and theyre not diseases theyre people people with lives

29497 :  he robbed him at gunpoint

29498 :  so that is an example both of wisdom in practice and the subversion of wisdom

29499 :  a wise person knows when to improvise

29500 :  and aristotle said hah they appreciated that sometimes to

29501 :  if you reward teachers for kids test scores they stop caring about educating and only care about test

29502 :  if you are a rule bender and an improviser mostly to serve yourself what you get is ruthless

29503 :  they dont understand us

29504 :  judge russell created the veterans court

29505 :  so it matters that you do this wise practice in the service of others and not in the service of

29506 :  and second they demoralize the activity itself

29507 :  and so what they do is they follow the scripts but they follow the scripts at double time and

29508 :  the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery is five years

29509 :  and that technology is the first technology that i just told you about

29510 :  if your heart stops working then you will have a heart disease and skin problems things like that

29511 :  and this is my thought

29512 :  and those are the barriers we want to overcome

29513 :  and i think people can realize that we are not really bound by

29514 :  its called mutations

29515 :  the second major breakthrough discovery happened in two thousand about ten years ago

29516 :  why did they stop dividing and die

29517 :  bmp2 is a natural signal that tells the cell to turn into bone

29518 :  its not exactly an embryo

29519 :  and you can see x ray photography underneath so that you can see a significant recovery

29520 :  with bmp2 natural signals soaked into a piece of sponge and put it on to that

29521 :  that means our physical limitations are already imposed

29522 :  it may be based on our genomes but it may not be our body anymore

29523 :  this is what happens during the process of what we call development

29524 :  it happens in cancer patients

29525 :  if you were given one hundred and fifty years or two hundred years or as long as you

29526 :  this is my solution

29527 :  we can actually change those genetic defects that youre born with and some people

29528 :  let me end my thoughts with the following two slides

29529 :  but at least i think i gave you a right question to ponder on

29530 :  so after three months it remains like a hole

29531 :  i am not really defined by my body

29532 :  the meditation instruction is very simple

29533 :  or is it still up there

29534 :  right its gone

29535 :  ca and that content is all off the board now

29536 :  there are plenty of downsides

29537 :  we became a conservation organization that dared to think differently

29538 :  and were willing to respond to the needs that communities told us about

29539 :  yet what id seen in madagascar stayed with me long after i returned home

29540 :  for the first time couples are able to plan their families

29541 :  and this appears to be strengthening their engagement in marine conservation

29542 :  these communities were so remote

29543 :  as a practicing doctor myself im constantly reminded of the importance of listening

29544 :  you dont vaccinate a few children

29545 :  but since digital memory has become so readily available we started to rely on computers on the

29546 :  then my brain reinforces the connection oh

29547 :  but if im walking down the street i walk pass somebodys house and theres this rottweiler out in the front yard barking growling its

29548 :  ill embrace that short attention span and become this multi tasking machine

29549 :  thats a perfectly valid option

29550 :  because your brain is made up of around twentyone billion brain cells or neurons and they make all sorts of

29551 :  twentyfive seconds eight and a quarter seconds

29552 :  thats the idea behind transactive memory

29553 :  so if i need to know this doctor who factoid or tidbit i can ask ben and the odds are hell be able to tell me about

29554 :  even if the going gets tough or weird or scary dont panic and just keep swimming

29555 :  because once you accept that knowledge you can start to ask yourself questions say things to yourself like you know what

29556 :  its just the idea your brain is adaptable it can change and reorganize itself

29557 :  if i copy that list of facts into a computer first i will remember less of them because by

29558 :  but most importantly youve chosen which path you wanted to pursue

29559 :  in two thousand and fifteen it had dropped to eight
29560 :  you are all like dory

29561 :  the whole reason ive been telling you this sharing this information with you telling you how and why

29562 :  our family had to run

29563 :  south africa was a country where i made my first my only best friend and in addition to the friends i

29564 :  they changed something

29565 :  but one of these options is huge and it has to do with that long standing question that

29566 :  as a kid i would puzzle over questions just like this

29567 :  but what if

29568 :  i would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets and i would read about the forces of the small and about quantum

29569 :  and well need to encourage more people to join us in studying science since we need fresh eyes on these century old

29570 :  but then what do we do

29571 :  so two thousand and fifteen was go time

29572 :  to discover new particles we need to reach these bigger numbers

29573 :  they have different rules

29574 :  and thats rare

29575 :  we need more data

29576 :  i see the looks on your faces

29577 :  and to do that we have to build a bigger higher energy collider and the biggest highest energy collider in the world

29578 :  we only decide to keep exploring

29579 :  but math is math and we can play around with our math however we want

29580 :  do we just give up and fly away

29581 :  it all started when we at cern saw something intriguing in our data

29582 :  what if the ultimate question

29583 :  we dont decide where nature places new particles

29584 :  absolutely not we would be terrible scientists if we did

29585 :  no we spend the next couple of decades exploring mapping out the territory sifting through the

29586 :  we already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in parts of the lhc but imagine designing a particle

29587 :  and people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space for a very long time but its always been an abstract mathematical

29588 :  what if the stuff thats bothered me since i was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime

29589 :  we are not separate from it

29590 :  they take only what they need from their forest

29591 :  they move their crops from one area to another to allow the soil to replenish and they carefully control their hunting

29592 :  when i visited that village a few months later i was shocked and saddened to find the

29593 :  its not far they told me

29594 :  uncontacted tribes are well aware of the existence of the outside world

29595 :  aw indians in the brazilian amazon for example have shown me how their uncontacted relatives use the resin of the ma

29596 :  because our consumption of wooden furniture of petrol for cars of gold jewellery is

29597 :  we are not watching the world from outside

29598 :  that theyre backward and primitive relics of a remote past

29599 :  they face catastrophe if their land is not protected

29600 :  ive seen ranchers call uncontacted indians dirty and lazy

29601 :  entering uncontacted tribes land and forcing contact is fatal

29602 :  its a right enshrined in national constitutions

29603 :  uncontacted kawahiva indians build intricate ladders up trees to collect honey from bees nests and they make traps

29604 :  and soon after they returned to their uncontacted lives in their forest covering their tracks as they went so that no one

29605 :  its a right enshrined by the united nations

29606 :  their land is being invaded by loggers miners ranchers oil and gas prospectors

29607 :  i took this photo to show what was happening and to generate pressure in their favor

29608 :  and ive worked with indigenous leaders who receive death threats simply for speaking out for their uncontacted relatives right to

29609 :  this is the moment of first

29610 :  within a few decades they will be extinct

29611 :  and in case thats not enough what about the health of our planet

29612 :  amazingly after thousands of people pushed the brazilian government to provide urgent health care the

29613 :  during the gold rush the rubber boom the decades of forced contact expeditions up until the late 1980s yet

29614 :  well we need to act fast

29615 :  or would you run and hide fleeing to protect your families and fight for your future

29616 :  he said well those dog owners they probably are lying about the dog food that they feed

29617 :  the main goal was to find the toxin

29618 :  and he had a suggestion why our data was wrong

29619 :  what kind of world was this

29620 :  the people on top the ones that make decisions directors and ministers did not want to continue this

29621 :  the response was an immediate denial

29622 :  a couple of years ago i received a phone call that pulled me into an investigation and

29623 :  number one is do your homework

29624 :  i want to have my money back

29625 :  passion will push you much further where others have already lost their interest long ago and stopped working

29626 :  i thought it sounds good

29627 :  it will slow you down and at the end of the day it will block you in anything youll do because youll be full of

29628 :  but why not

29629 :  weve got an insurance for our car of course weve got an insurance for our health system then weve got an

29630 :  and then i realized i dont want to do the nine to five job thing anymore

29631 :  ill do the reality check there

29632 :  ill try that

29633 :  because why not

29634 :  oh on fridays i normally dont work i always party then the ugly truth is its

29635 :  i just want to get rid of all this system we have which surrounded us

29636 :  i went there ok it was my duty as well but i shared all the information i had about pr

29637 :  so if you guys are going to come up and say i didnt have time its a sunny day

29638 :  and i can tell you one thing

29639 :  everything that i was living in everything that surrounded me was based on a regular

29640 :  i shared all the information i had

29641 :  if you want to see something grow never keep what you know

29642 :  and he said well because were bankrupt

29643 :  no no no no

29644 :  and as youll see in this simulation as they interact they gain points as it were they grow and when theyve doubled

29645 :  im saying we are homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the

29646 :  the slowest rowers the weakest rowers are going to get cut from the team

29647 :  im offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind

29648 :  the message that unaids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual

29649 :  and her baby will receive pmtct which will mean that that baby can be born free of the

29650 :  sing campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me

29651 :  it doesnt have to be in the closet

29652 :  so it was obviously it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this

29653 :  i became a member of treatment action campaign and im very proud to be a member of that incredible

29654 :  i have to serve

29655 :  there was another option

29656 :  what im saying is that i have to live up to my own mistakes

29657 :  and i think ive worked out why

29658 :  we just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two

29659 :  all the time hes been doing sixtyfive miles per hour down the freeway

29660 :  every one of them told us they loved it

29661 :  so back in two thousand and thirteen we had the first test of a self driving car where we let regular people

29662 :  and of course he has to go

29663 :  a sonnet is a fourteen line poem and shakespeare wrote over

29664 :  and i have to tell you i actually for a moment was a bit afraid

29665 :  i did not understand

29666 :  and the smallpox vaccination is bovine based because of that dairy farmer

29667 :  but she knew

29668 :  but ill be the first one to tell you this subject matter can be hard awkward

29669 :  we show courage

29670 :  and one day my coach had me do a drill where i had to swim to one end of a twentyfive meter pool without taking a

29671 :  or how was the cake

29672 :  there are literally no words right

29673 :  there is shock followed by a long silence

29674 :  and she looked me right in the eye and she said they will not always treat you well

29675 :  so i had an idea

29676 :  it doesnt mean that at all

29677 :  my friend harold ford calls me

29678 :  i called a friend who was in new york at one of the most successful media companies in the world and she

29679 :  i cite those statistics around corporate board diversity because they are real and i stand here today

29680 :  and every single time i failed i had to start over

29681 :  the blood drains from her face

29682 :  what can i do

29683 :  that drill was to make you comfortable being uncomfortable because thats how most of us spend our

29684 :  and i failed a lot

29685 :  and my coach looked me at me and he said mellody that was not a breath holding exercise

29686 :  now color blindness in my view doesnt mean that theres no racial discrimination and theres

29687 :  if youre part of a hiring process or an admissions process you can be color brave

29688 :  as citizens im asking you not to leave any child behind

29689 :  all that just with the power of our thoughts isnt that great

29690 :  i invented the first worldwide jewelry including that anchoring technique and that

29691 :  but im talking about the feeling of winning

29692 :  just when thinking of a lovely person or of the process all you guys love i know that

29693 :  off course im not talking about any necessary things im trying to keep it serious today even is going to be a little difficult

29694 :  people will no longer feel the need to label themselves as gay or straight

29695 :  in a future non homophobic society as the taboos around same sex

29696 :  the vast majority of people i do believe will be open to the possibility of both opposite

29697 :  as we evolve to a more sexually enlightened and accepting society

29698 :  as we know from psychology many people have hidden unconscious desires

29699 :  and given the nature of gene drives that conversation has to be global

29700 :  so thank goodness they cant be used to engineer viruses or bacteria

29701 :  how do you get your trait to spread

29702 :  i feel like people expect me to conform to certain things that i have no interest in conforming to

29703 :  now this is where things got a bit tricky for me

29704 :  i turned to my friend and i said i cant do this

29705 :  now this is where i come in and tell you a little bit about myself and why i get asked these questions all the time

29706 :  before i tell you that i want to go through a few basic concepts so that were all on the same page

29707 :  when i got back home i started telling more people that i was trans and when i was eighteen i had my big coming

29708 :  on the way back home after this trip we met two icelandic women on the same train to the airport and as

29709 :  so gender and the way people identify their gender are therefore often much more complex and the reality is much more

29710 :  sometimes youll get people who will tell you that you arent this or you are this or youre not that and youre

29711 :  you might wonder

29712 :  i have worked in a number of different arenas of health

29713 :  because i have heard all the stories of how our traditional healers maybe have not been as respected as they could be

29714 :  but actually the opposite happened

29715 :  now what is interesting when i talk to my uncles who are traditional healers they talk about how over the years they would use

29716 :  i was really worried about what my uncles would think about that

29717 :  i always like to joke when people say what does pejuta wicasa mean

29718 :  i was very fortunate i was able to go to stanford for medical school and i have my mph from harvard

29719 :  they were not discouraging if anything they were very encouraging

29720 :  so they developed chemicals to kill each other

29721 :  the reason is that for millions of years bacteria and mold have competed with each other

29722 :  i am very fortunate to come from a family with a lot of traditional healers

29723 :  but we saw a huge change in the twentieth century because of advances in science

29724 :  do multiple cultures have the opportunity to embrace what they once had in terms of a healthier lifestyle

29725 :  so historically our tribe has been using antibiotics for thousands of years potentially

29726 :  i am sure many of you are familiar with this symbol

29727 :  and probably the biggest scientific advance that we found in modern science is the discovery of antibiotics

29728 :  we know that there must be a lot of high energy electrons in the plane to produce the synchrotron

29729 :  i wanted to see everything that the universe had to offer

29730 :  the same thing happens with light

29731 :  i wanted to seek out new life

29732 :  the dust stops the visible light from getting to us

29733 :  this image is also black and white so we dont really know what is the color of everything in here

29734 :  everywhere it pervades us like the force

29735 :  the dust stops it getting to us

29736 :  well very well so weve seen one radio galaxy

29737 :  its possible to do better

29738 :  and im very excited

29739 :  i come back to the prison not because i have issues

29740 :  why dont we turn prisons into schools

29741 :  i said turn prisons into schools

29742 :  in my experience lack of education is at the heart of the many problems that lead to prison

29743 :  death is something that were often discouraged to talk about or even think about but ive realized that

29744 :  we criticized people a lot in bosnia for being quite slow to take on war criminals

29745 :  were not matching our resources to our priorities

29746 :  but you need to look at context

29747 :  now is this a new idea

29748 :  instead of which weve allowed ourselves to be tempted towards regime change

29749 :  the problem in libya is that we are always pushing for the black or white

29750 :  they simply dont have a conventional military option

29751 :  this program will know exactly what to do

29752 :  how the technologies they use every single day work

29753 :  coding is the home economics of tomorrow

29754 :  the students that have access to these courses are not just learning how to code and manipulate technology

29755 :  its all about learning how to think

29756 :  awareness raising is required at every level of society

29757 :  the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours but their demands were not met and so eventually they learned not

29758 :  they are often hungry

29759 :  yet i could see soiled nappies and i could see that some of the children were distressed but the only noise was a low

29760 :  and its only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children

29761 :  and instead of being provided with positive messages about their childs potential are told by the doctors

29762 :  in august one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree i had my first opportunity to witness on a massive scale

29763 :  it is the model for all future relationships with friends with partners and with their own

29764 :  once we got there and she got out of the car a different ashley

29765 :  ok so maybe another ten minutes earlier than that

29766 :  im also very curious about anxiety

29767 :  and you know what

29768 :  thats great ok no worries

29769 :  you cant reserve your seat

29770 :  so you may want to start reading about brain development about childhood

29771 :  i have experienced it myself and ive worked with many many many anxious people over the

29772 :  so when we get out of the car pching

29773 :  and ashley have been referred to me when i was working for wish for a brighter future which is a

29774 :  we better get in that queue

29775 :  so become meerkat observers of yourself and of others and take the trouble

29776 :  i did not make this up

29777 :  our children find stuff as well to numb their meerkats out

29778 :  what if theres a queue to get in

29779 :  they love rhythm meerkats

29780 :  and none of that is good stuff either

29781 :  this is not exciting enough

29782 :  thats reason number one

29783 :  ue usually im wearing a helmet

29784 :  so in summer two thousand i was the first to base jump the eiger north face in switzerland

29785 :  he took college credit courses so when he got out he was able to get a masters and today hes a manager at

29786 :  but its important to remember that those early writing systems didnt come out of a vacuum

29787 :  now if these were random doodles or decorations we would expect to see a lot more variation but instead what we

29788 :  they were the original shoulders

29789 :  and after the moment of transmission its gone forever

29790 :  so while he filmed me i kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point and shoot

29791 :  this could be pharmacology based and cognitive behavioral therapy based

29792 :  how was her perception of the world different from mine

29793 :  choose option a not b

29794 :  these individuals have high values of kappa

29795 :  in other words what does it mean to have a good theory of mind to be able to put oneself

29796 :  so i believe that bozosity is like the flu

29797 :  not spreadsheet database or word processor

29798 :  they wanted to bring computing power to everyone

29799 :  make a mantra

29800 :  how can you change the world

29801 :  oh and you fathers out there

29802 :  the brains remain hardwired for music

29803 :  you dont actually have to hear it

29804 :  you would think that because these implants are optimized for speech they were designed for speech

29805 :  ill find it ill find it

29806 :  its wrapped up in my cultural heritage

29807 :  see i keep my hair natural so its not to deviate too far from the masterwork the creator has given

29808 :  my hair is important to me

29809 :  for the young people of durban

29810 :  maybe thats why

29811 :  i thought to myself

29812 :  one day we go to another mall

29813 :  what am i going to do with my hair

29814 :  its a cross cultural exchange

29815 :  he had been conscripted into my group he really wanted to be in

29816 :  so again the middle east and north africa stand out on this measure as having four times the level

29817 :  ive pulled them out of the chart and ill blow them up to represent their population size

29818 :  only four despite the fact that the muslim population has more than doubled in the last decade from half a

29819 :  to my surprise and the surprise of almost everyone religion not only

29820 :  we hopped in his car we drove as fast as we could to the wall and we were part of the

29821 :  a time when many hoped that freedom would come as spring would come

29822 :  and if they do social violence also often results

29823 :  thats a government restriction

29824 :  he said the wall its falling right now

29825 :  and the answer to that is yes we can

29826 :  i wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our

29827 :  its commonly reported in ukraine that children when leaving the orphanage are targeted for human

29828 :  so theyre testing its virulence

29829 :  and are monitoring their progress to see if it will effectively kill them

29830 :  and i was therefore able to photograph the fully assembled remains

29831 :  yet these men remain dead

29832 :  think of things that could be at risk of dying out like small agriculture or skilled trades

29833 :  thats three times as many as new york city takes

29834 :  we have these great new partners in our dream for a brighter future

29835 :  and if we can do that everybody wins

29836 :  and down at the other hand theres low cost wheelchairs but theyre hard to propel in rough terrain and they break down pretty

29837 :  so this has become the mantra of my research group at mit

29838 :  with these two products

29839 :  it was an easy fix we were able to swap out the tubes and valves but were sure glad that we learned that lesson with twenty chairs

29840 :  by doing this we can meet the needs of the two
29841 :  initially our focus had been on the work we were doing in developing countries

29842 :  we shipped the chairs over we had a lot of fun getting people rolling around

29843 :  if artists are doing this cant you imagine if art education was a place where we

29844 :  we find that its really difficult to engage our students in creative work in particular open ended

29845 :  it just makes it really hard

29846 :  i actually learned this from a group of teachers

29847 :  what do i mean by that

29848 :  they either play with materials until ideas begin to manifest or they play with ideas

29849 :  they play in a number of ways

29850 :  that discomfort and that discomfort is ambiguity its not knowing

29851 :  we also know the creativity scores in this country are on the decline that torrance creativity

29852 :  but i can only hope ive whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are

29853 :  i thought it might be interesting even for the many long time collectors here with us at ted local collectors

29854 :  but this is what we do when we are young

29855 :  they eventually charged me and eleven other people with conspiracy to commit criminal damage

29856 :  i do not know where we are going

29857 :  i would ask you to think about those boundaries that are being drawn around your existence and the way they are changing your

29858 :  and how and why people reappropriate these places

29859 :  we solved our curiosity in the obvious way we waited until two in the morning we jumped over the fences we

29860 :  its not deep

29861 :  or think of those times during life changes when you may be in menopause or midlife or going through separation

29862 :  so its based on the premise of things like

29863 :  and we respect that because we embrace that

29864 :  think about it

29865 :  crazy is a word that has an old meaning

29866 :  have i got a crazy going on right now

29867 :  im married to the rcmp

29868 :  she had found the ability to manage her crazy

29869 :  i cant live like this anymore

29870 :  it has a bad reputation

29871 :  maybe try buying a crossword puzzle book

29872 :  it might be reading an article thats relevant that has a suggestion in it for you

29873 :  because what we want to do is we want to create that change

29874 :  i dont like you saying the word crazy in this context

29875 :  and everybody is with you on it

29876 :  and when we create one change its going to become contagious

29877 :  embrace your crazy

29878 :  it might work

29879 :  and when we create these small changes what we do is we momentarily interrupt

29880 :  eighty percent of students are reading at or above grade level but

29881 :  play is a critical component of this developmental stage as students are learning so much about the

29882 :  it has to stand out from the crowd

29883 :  business strategy means finding gaps in the market things that nobody else is doing

29884 :  we bring together hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia

29885 :  we were fairly alone on this journey for quite a while

29886 :  its an incredible accomplishment but its only the first step

29887 :  that was how much effort it

29888 :  and as a result our happiness

29889 :  when i reflect on those two words let me try to do that

29890 :  now specifically im talking about observational drawing which means to observe something and draw an

29891 :  this idea create a dangerous mental block to human capacity

29892 :  fortunately researchers are proving that mastering any field depends much more on

29893 :  drawing habituates that thought process and bearing it in mind is a perfectly natural way of

29894 :  too often people experience a sense of shame regarding their mistakes but imagine what might have been different in your life had

29895 :  the most fundamental way to make an image is to draw one

29896 :  forty of our brain is devoted to processing visual information thats more than all over

29897 :  in fact new ideas only occur when we take risks and our failures become productive

29898 :  light lines can be drawn evaluated and redrawn as many times as necessary in

29899 :  we have the goals

29900 :  i see myself as a disruptor

29901 :  if we know that we also need to understand that people with disabilities arent a

29902 :  she was able to engage people in our space to be able to help her to do this and shes off and running now with a business

29903 :  it means that because of massive interconnectivity and the availability of artificial

29904 :  so somebody making a gate for example out of metal may take a week to make just one gate but with this machine they might

29905 :  so this was designed by my head of engineering

29906 :  so i kind of had to change hats and became quite entrepreneurial and started looking for money to buy the

29907 :  shes not an engineer

29908 :  so the significance here is that the piloting process is possible

29909 :  and immediately we had wonderful results

29910 :  we have lots of discussions in our space around who we were as africans who we are today and who we want to be vis vis things like

29911 :  now i was fortunate enough to do my undergrad and postgrad education in the uk and the us in

29912 :  so in kenya right now we have volkswagen peugeot renault we have mercedes doing lorries and weve also got

29913 :  i would even memorize lines from some of the plays like one time she was in this play called slavs by tony

29914 :  hold on i have absolutely no experience with any of this

29915 :  i did have some great initial support

29916 :  and it wasnt just me i was watching my friends most of them who had never been in plays before

29917 :  i think a lot of people have really terrible experiences with shakespeare because they first learn about him

29918 :  but i probably should have stopped and thought

29919 :  so as far as i was concerned i had the support and the resources i needed

29920 :  i went to my friend jamila and she said only if i can play horatio

29921 :  i would recite them to my mom sometimes and she would say yeah thats great honey just dont say that in front of

29922 :  we were doing shakespeare together in my backyard we were working on this amazing material

29923 :  we did twelve angry women im going to put on hamlet

29924 :  we performed hamlet in my backyard and people came and enjoyed it

29925 :  i did take a class on shakespeare and i had to write essays about his plays which i very enjoyed by the

29926 :  i played juror number three
29927 :  nobody told me to do this i had the idea on my own and i carried it through on my own

29928 :  and we had fun

29929 :  i want to leave you with three thoughts

29930 :  i interviewed a professor at a university who trained a number of people who went on to work at the weapons labs

29931 :  so i soon realized that they were thinking about the ethics of the work but the lab didnt create a space

29932 :  they didnt say well i really wanted to design nuclear weapons

29933 :  over a couple years i lived in three different homes with different people who worked at the lab

29934 :  president george h

29935 :  this resulted in a couple of books

29936 :  the five official nuclear powers have no plans to abolish their nuclear weapons

29937 :  theres a real danger in that abstraction

29938 :  so they werent political ideologues they didnt do this because they felt passionately hostile to communism

29939 :  now theyre not even tested underground

29940 :  i also moved into housing that i shared with people who worked at the lab

29941 :  they look pretty and psychedelic like this

29942 :  i see them put together work groups

29943 :  ive got a good memory

29944 :  i just want to know what the programs are

29945 :  i was in receiving and releasing one day working overtime and there was an inmate he was pacing back and forth

29946 :  i see them put together self help groups

29947 :  that way when you deal with an inmate you know exactly what youre coming from because thats what they deal with respect

29948 :  i want to go home the same way i came to work

29949 :  i see the rehab

29950 :  its about how do you become that leader whether its in your workplace whether its in your home and

29951 :  when we talk about the wage gap we often say women make seventyeight cents to every

29952 :  and that is intricately related to black lives

29953 :  you all have heard that before

29954 :  and theres a way in which weve been kind of transformed into celebrities rather than

29955 :  and the way that we treat celebrities is very fickle right

29956 :  we have to address problems at the root and when you deal with whats happening in black

29957 :  its not just about coming and watching people on a stage right

29958 :  the reality is that black women make something like sixtyfour cents to every seventyeight cents

29959 :  and in order for us to get to that point i think theres a few things that we need to be doing

29960 :  i had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise because they showed me

29961 :  and the closer to black that you are on that spectrum the worse off your are

29962 :  im inspired by seeing older people step into their own power and leadership and say im

29963 :  they were able to launch new programs fundraise

29964 :  we like them one day we dont like what theyre wearing the next day and all of a sudden we have issues right

29965 :  they were reeling from the earthquake they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by un peacekeepers

29966 :  be a part of something

29967 :  but im so inspired when i see people who have a way that they do things have a way that

29968 :  we can have disagreements without being disagreeable but its important for us

29969 :  its happening to me i know thats right

29970 :  one call the white house

29971 :  and when i came back

29972 :  get involved dont sit on your couch and tell people what you think they should be doing

29973 :  what you do is extremely precious

29974 :  i want to give you just one example from australia in two thousand and fifteen
29975 :  i am proud that my personal engagement and enthusiasm towards this topic of carers found an echo in my

29976 :  and above all how can we make sure that their value to patients our healthcare system and

29977 :  ive been working in the healthcare sector for the last fifteen years and one of the things that drew me to this sector

29978 :  the objective is to empower carers to improve their own health and well being and bring about a greater

29979 :  my company is committed to this cause and has developed an unprecedented framework for its

29980 :  carers all over the world are sacrificing their own physical financial and psychosocial

29981 :  if carers around the world felt better recognized it would not only improve their own health and well being and

29982 :  they couldnt figure it out

29983 :  its about helping people achieve the goals that they want to achieve and not determining what their goals should

29984 :  it was already your lived experience

29985 :  you all have the power to do that

29986 :  i dont want to have a nice christmas

29987 :  i want someone to love me make me feel like i matter make me believe i can be somebody instead of making me

29988 :  its what you were exposed to as a young child

29989 :  monthly cash assistance housing allowance food stamps weekly trips to the food

29990 :  what a powerful message to send to a young person

29991 :  individuals like my first grade teacher who always told me how smart i was and how lucky

29992 :  and i looked at him and his eyes welled up with tears and he said man these people dont

29993 :  he started pacing back and forth and i asked him whats going on

29994 :  its the kind of life you expected

29995 :  she wanted to be an advocate for those she considered voiceless because she said their needs

29996 :  it was a couple weeks before the winter holidays and a colleague came forward

29997 :  and i am proof of that

29998 :  and im talking straight up welfare

29999 :  and that is truly how i live my life both personally and professionally

30000 :  i wouldnt be standing here proudly today had others not believed in me and shown me the way

30001 :  so as mahatma gandhi said be the change that you wish to see in the world

30002 :  and later that day that student came down to my office just completely upset

30003 :  how was this possible

30004 :  the product is completely adaptive

30005 :  in fact it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world

30006 :  i know its very complicated

30007 :  he chose compassion

30008 :  and now im worried

30009 :  why havent you taken a shower

30010 :  shes laughing she trusts me

30011 :  but this time after about thirty minutes she starts to crack a smile

30012 :  he could have judged me like those on the bus

30013 :  she says i cant

30014 :  and were making progress

30015 :  because judgement and shame perpetuates this illness

30016 :  i found myself trying to escape

30017 :  but just like the innovations in technologies that started in garages and dorm rooms in the past my project really picked up

30018 :  what if i give it a shot

30019 :  but we must try

30020 :  when doctors examined their hymens they could only find clear signs of penetration

30021 :  this was noted over one hundred years ago in one thousand nine hundred and six by the norwegian doctor marie

30022 :  in other words hymens naturally vary a lot in looks and that is what makes

30023 :  but it may look a bit different from before

30024 :  the myths about the hymen have lived on for centuries because they have cultural

30025 :  this is a free tool lending service

30026 :  i had this one doctor dr

30027 :  maybe theyll get in the nurses way

30028 :  and so what do we do

30029 :  he gave all kinds of reasons

30030 :  my mother was brave though and she had hope

30031 :  when we asked what do you want to know about your doctors

30032 :  becoming a doctor was my dream

30033 :  i leave you today with a final thought

30034 :  within one week of starting whos my doctor

30035 :  theres another side to this fear

30036 :  we go beyond the government in the sunshine act about drug company affiliations and we talk about

30037 :  well i wanted to be just like dr

30038 :  then we go one step further

30039 :  i fell in love with paul as i watched the care he took with his patients

30040 :  and i was like whoa i guess we get to say anything out loud

30041 :  i was working as an internist and paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon

30042 :  paul didnt want a ventilator and cpr

30043 :  we got married and became doctors

30044 :  the question then becomes well alright how are we doing

30045 :  its about one percent

30046 :  the perspective is very simply this

30047 :  hello good morning its a pleasure to be with you

30048 :  its a small word

30049 :  so i do what it takes to make myself feel happy

30050 :  take your time

30051 :  dont let us put pressure on you because were faster than you

30052 :  there is no try

30053 :  i cant believe it

30054 :  i take them to the park

30055 :  i pedal every day

30056 :  i call it right here right now

30057 :  in fact it was my friends and my family who taught me a new skill

30058 :  bit by bit im making it happen

30059 :  now lets talk about the first one

30060 :  well theres a multitude of factors at play but i think one of the key factors is that the tools that

30061 :  fifteen minutes later i was on my way to the emergency room with a full blown asthma attack

30062 :  now i want to share this picture with you

30063 :  now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations put them on chips and create

30064 :  and were doing just that

30065 :  theyve even try to grow little mini organs in the lab

30066 :  it really just isnt working and that means that patients that badly need new

30067 :  when they get damaged say by cigarette smoke for example they dont work properly

30068 :  i want to share this with you because its a beautiful photograph

30069 :  there are other things like genetic differences in populations that may lead to

30070 :  i just couldnt shake it thought ill try something different

30071 :  theres fluid flowing across these cells so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips

30072 :  were establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with

30073 :  we need human cells but we need to find a way to keep them happy outside the body

30074 :  and those individual differences mean that we could react very differently and sometimes in

30075 :  and this is key to the potential of that technology

30076 :  plug and play

30077 :  i took some advil

30078 :  and why are this useful

30079 :  but today we all have mobile phones

30080 :  goodness i mean im astonished right now

30081 :  i mean when i was a child if somebody said somebody is like this i would have said impossible

30082 :  my favorite pass time is sleeping and dreaming

30083 :  believe me it will

30084 :  and your impossible will become possible

30085 :  like who had ever thought that we would have one day something like a mobile phone

30086 :  so i would like to ask you a question

30087 :  i began this talk with models

30088 :  chris anderson i really like this metaphor

30089 :  so this is a very common disease

30090 :  and the river runs about 520kms from tornetr sk down to bottenviken

30091 :  i just wanted to remind you all that you still have the helmets on which is great

30092 :  someone spent a countless number of hours slamming down on the keyboard typing all that code that makes your

30093 :  we had no letters we had nothing where she said this is everything that i want you to remember me by

30094 :  my father in law not so interested but thats ok because my mother in law she soaked it in

30095 :  how do we really make an impact

30096 :  does she sit at the computer all day

30097 :  how are we going to help them

30098 :  i probably would have told my mother in law

30099 :  thats up to you to think about

30100 :  the time i spent teaching these things to my in laws was a powerful experience

30101 :  for me and for them

30102 :  dont slam a family member or a friend for a choice they made online

30103 :  we didnt see it coming

30104 :  it will help you make decisions about helping guide other family members and making decisions for yourself

30105 :  my kids were six and ten

30106 :  but you know what

30107 :  a gift that i feel that everyone deserves to have

30108 :  did you send that because i think youve been hacked

30109 :  my kids twelve now theres another one as well

30110 :  thats just in this first year

30111 :  we didnt have those things that you wish you had

30112 :  its a thought process your whole family needs to understand

30113 :  ive got to share this this is amazing

30114 :  bring the big family thanksgiving family reunion if its not family its your tight close circle of

30115 :  quietly nudging someone to change their password before it spreads to another family or friend

30116 :  we really shouldnt be doing that online

30117 :  why dont we do that online

30118 :  also i know youve seen it somebody who posted something and youre like

30119 :  a higher level of digital literacy can help

30120 :  more and more services require you to fill out a form online

30121 :  but you know what we had

30122 :  did you post that or is it a hack

30123 :  what makes you upset online

30124 :  you dont have to comment and like everything within five minutes

30125 :  so we had to think about is there a more general way in which we can start to understand the world and make a visual field

30126 :  what were all those renaissances about though

30127 :  and my friend said

30128 :  his team created zappos

30129 :  we all know that sinking feeling when you think you forgot your mobile device

30130 :  youve got to run back home because theres no way youre going to function without it

30131 :  youd get on the bike it sways it wobbles you fall

30132 :  he thought we were nuts

30133 :  he reinvented the way that we purchase shoes because he had a passion for delivering happiness

30134 :  i had a dinner party a few weeks ago and i was running around and i had no idea if people actually enjoyed

30135 :  its how we do what we do

30136 :  these devices are what we call the internet of things

30137 :  so growing up here my father was heavily into technology so i naturally fell into it

30138 :  why did he do all that

30139 :  my family and i actually emigrated here from iran during the war

30140 :  no he had already made millions and lost it

30141 :  we often relate silences with

30142 :  initially it was a daunting process for the service member but eventually he began to think of bfib as the mask

30143 :  years later after his physical wounds had healed and hed returned home he rarely spoke of his

30144 :  the schools are filled with positive messages and posters that foster a sense of empowerment

30145 :  its one of two homes that the olive branch runs that provides children orphaned by hiv aids with a happy home

30146 :  because of her the majority of the clients in their ward are also unafraid now to say that they are hiv

30147 :  edina also heads up the peace home

30148 :  although there are big schools and medical facilities offered by the government in the bigger towns and cities

30149 :  so im sure youve experienced this or not experienced this

30150 :  the first mode of the brain is the focused mode

30151 :  but we dont give ourselves enough doses of that

30152 :  what should i dread

30153 :  thats what i believe science doesnt know it

30154 :  or chasing deadlines

30155 :  these networks collaborate to create two modes of the brain

30156 :  i had come here to become a cancer specialist

30157 :  so we develop a judgmental attention

30158 :  can i trust him with my cattle my house my family

30159 :  our mind is wandering

30160 :  they work one hundred percent of the time

30161 :  so we were focused on safety and survival

30162 :  minus five seconds right

30163 :  another challenge is hedonic adaptation

30164 :  two supporting ideas here

30165 :  lets say you have not met your partner for thirty days

30166 :  honey you were really right when you

30167 :  so that is a challenge

30168 :  these are all intentional sprinkle practices

30169 :  that is what we need and we are sprinkling it

30170 :  thats one kind of ballet

30171 :  when we try to determine when we pick an option we try to determine what the world will be like

30172 :  what can we know

30173 :  of scientific books published each year that you can read

30174 :  as luhmann argued if the world is too complex for you then have some part of the complexity

30175 :  they didnt tell you anything about consequences

30176 :  there are at least three types and only one is

30177 :  and since we cannot change we cannot simplify and since we cannot simplify thus

30178 :  but while were able to use it were never able to alter it

30179 :  thats the complexity consequences problem

30180 :  the facts we are responsible for the breakfast you had this morning for sure

30181 :  well theres trust

30182 :  we can use gravity but we cannot change what gravity is

30183 :  i only did the math

30184 :  and the last point is human conduct

30185 :  ok ill trust you because youre higher in the ranking

30186 :  and my main point is that that structure needs to be sufficiently complex to match the

30187 :  they too were practicing the cult of the figures

30188 :  and what do they tell you

30189 :  that person needs to commit himself to the problem and that means he gets into

30190 :  then we can say no it wasnt me who decided it was the math

30191 :  and thats not the future we are trying to have

30192 :  yes we can predict human conduct with computers

30193 :  they claim that it could all be solved by threshold an upper limit a number saying

30194 :  what were the consequences for the first two hundred thousand
30195 :  so one such program exists in jaffa called the orchard of abrahams children

30196 :  this is because your mind categorizes everything with language labels so that it can reach for your memories as

30197 :  so what do you think everyone

30198 :  so when my german friend taught me this word i thought

30199 :  and everything that you say and do every decision you make every conversation that you have is just a

30200 :  and did you know that the languages that your child is exposed to before the age of seven which is also

30201 :  have you ever heard of linguistic relativity

30202 :  how do parents use kids wear

30203 :  what is the american dream

30204 :  but not just a home

30205 :  and each and everyone of us is living it today

30206 :  while procrastinating on writing an essay you study for your math test

30207 :  there is what doctor oz tells us

30208 :  play tennis too hard on your knees ruin your cartilage the cartilage never comes back

30209 :  our arteries can clog

30210 :  what are the things that they all do

30211 :  and we managed to boil it down to nine

30212 :  deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes those brain cells die they never come back

30213 :  so the premise of blue zones if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a

30214 :  thats why a sixtyfive year old person is aging at a rate of about one hundred and twentyfive times

30215 :  our brains can gunk up with plaque and we can get alzheimers

30216 :  and i think it supremely illustrates the premise of this blue zone project

30217 :  so to make it to age one hundred you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle you also have to have

30218 :  there is not a button to push to do yard work or house work

30219 :  and in the northern part of the main island this is ground zero for world longevity

30220 :  that burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does

30221 :  when it comes to supplements should you be taking them

30222 :  they dont have any conveniences

30223 :  when they do do intentional physical activity its the things they enjoy

30224 :  but when you think about it your friends are long term adventures and therefore

30225 :  if they want to mix up a cake theyre doing it by hand

30226 :  they also have a three thousand year old adage which i think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented

30227 :  but for every one of those negative messages i receive thousands of messages filled with love

30228 :  its something thats out of my control

30229 :  its something that i cannot fix and i only have two choices

30230 :  and thats under reported and thats only physical abuse so the real number is much higher

30231 :  its better if you just brush it under the rug keep it behind closed doors bury your head in the sand and

30232 :  no matter what you do you do not deserve to be treated with disrespect and

30233 :  and there was a sign there that had a bunch of questions on it

30234 :  because at the end of the day abuse is just about power and control

30235 :  thats a lot of people

30236 :  i dont know whats going on

30237 :  but that does not mean that we deserve any less than one hundred percent respect when we are flawed when we

30238 :  it cannot possibly happen to me again

30239 :  i had a purpose

30240 :  and one day as i was in my dilemma and in my confusion of thoughts and everything i was

30241 :  were meant to have flaws

30242 :  because guess what

30243 :  were meant to be imperfect

30244 :  but theres a very fine line between healthy jealousy and unhealthy controlling behaviour and its so important to be aware of

30245 :  it creeps up on you

30246 :  so i figured i had to knock it on the head

30247 :  thats an awful problem

30248 :  it is an illusion like sunsets

30249 :  and think of what i have told you

30250 :  maybe consciousness exists but it cant make any difference to the world

30251 :  if it consciously seems to you that you are conscious you are conscious

30252 :  but the second one had an incredible influence and may still be around and that is

30253 :  youre a very cleverly constructed robot

30254 :  computation only exists relative to consciousness

30255 :  science is objective consciousness is subjective therefore there cannot be a

30256 :  i mean i wont demonstrate pain behavior but i can tell you i am not having any pains right now

30257 :  i used to get in an argument that really gave me a stomachache

30258 :  i dont want to think about it

30259 :  we are not ready for a scientific definition but here is the common sense definition

30260 :  but when i hold out my pocket calculator and do the calculation the only intrinsic

30261 :  i think it is rather easy to define if you are not trying to give a scientific definition

30262 :  because we are the very existence of consciousness

30263 :  and i want to tell you that argument briefly and that is

30264 :  i promised to refute all these guys but i dont have an awful lot of time left but let me refute a couple more of them

30265 :  so its an obvious mistake

30266 :  the disappointment of robotics derives from the fact that we dont know how to make a conscious robot so we dont have a

30267 :  why did they make the mistake

30268 :  and this if you have ever had a philosophy course this is known as the famous mind body problem

30269 :  i dont think

30270 :  but in any case its not part of science

30271 :  now with that in mind with going through these various features of consciousness lets go

30272 :  well some computations are intrinsic

30273 :  and we have not been able to do that in a robot

30274 :  i dont think that for a moment

30275 :  more that thirty years ago but there is a deeper argument implicit in what ive told you

30276 :  maybe we will be able to build a conscious machine but since we dont know how our brains do it we are not in the position

30277 :  the next feature of consciousness after this marvelous unified conscious field is that

30278 :  and they are realized in the brain as higher level or system features

30279 :  thats the first feature of consciousness

30280 :  you cannot doubt the existence of your own consciousness

30281 :  now we know that thats wrong

30282 :  despite government promises of extra cash mental health services have struggled with years of

30283 :  when depression becomes severe suicidal thoughts are common

30284 :  and what if it didnt work

30285 :  we had a holiday planned theyd have time to bury me grieve take a holiday to get over it

30286 :  but that wouldnt be fair on the driver

30287 :  thinking id already hit rock bottom i now contemplated a life as a social pariah

30288 :  so the best thing that happened to us so far in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the

30289 :  and not just any type of brain cancer he was diagnosed with one of the most deadly forms of brain cancer

30290 :  i dont think we quite won this war yet and i dont think anyone here will question that

30291 :  i took out everything

30292 :  for me it was mostly outrage

30293 :  a lot of things are going through your head

30294 :  i mean because we at this point we can protect it

30295 :  i think its sort of funny its on the siberian coast maybe the russians will charge tolls

30296 :  and when it dies it falls to the bottom and then it rots which means that

30297 :  and thats everywhere

30298 :  but when it gets too hot the algae cant make the sugar

30299 :  the military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously

30300 :  the really scary things though are the physical chemical

30301 :  industrial fishing uses big stuff big machinery

30302 :  its not about the fish its not about the pollution its not about the climate change

30303 :  cod fed most of the people of western europe

30304 :  then you sure wont want to eat fish that were raised in it because it would be a kind of gastronomic

30305 :  a three meter long shark a great white shark

30306 :  i remember that day

30307 :  but what really touched me the most about them as i was learning about their behavior is that even in

30308 :  so its likely im related to every resnick that i ever meet but i dont know

30309 :  turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named joe beery who was lucky enough to be the cio of a company called life

30310 :  doing so is the first step in overcoming the all too common paradigm of

30311 :  i created my own story

30312 :  were going to recreate this story

30313 :  that was my aha

30314 :  when we talk about this framework with our content creators they instantly get it no matter what beat they cover what

30315 :  she told us that she had been suffering with a depression for over five years and that she didnt ask for

30316 :  i was scared to say that my mum had committed suicide

30317 :  for example if i go to a psychiatrist saying that i want to commit suicide or i have even tried to

30318 :  remember alex only thirteen
30319 :  after a while she came up to me she hugged me and she said thank you

30320 :  and i would lie i would say that it was cancer or a heart attack

30321 :  what a strange thing

30322 :  this means that if it is not you it is somebody sitting next to you

30323 :  this time though the insurers and government said

30324 :  it was an adidas marketing campaign back in two thousand and fourteen called the impossible

30325 :  so the big tip television show in the 70s was marcus welby

30326 :  now heres what marcus welby was

30327 :  so that brings us to two thousand and fourteen and why was two thousand and fourteen important to me

30328 :  well amazingly the docs said no

30329 :  so how did we get there

30330 :  not only that weve changed the way we do things

30331 :  so we took some of the best people doing mathematical modeling and created a predictive analytics and mathematical modeling

30332 :  and that didnt happen

30333 :  what did that do for us over the last ten years

30334 :  and now we recognize that we can take things from other industries

30335 :  im steve klasko

30336 :  because after all thats why they came to our university

30337 :  now we spend most of our time in what we call the art of attending

30338 :  we measure individuals professional and personal happiness at varying intervals after graduation

30339 :  for those of you from the 2010s its sort of like a red box for your dna

30340 :  so at jefferson for example in two thousand and fourteen we started the center for healthcare entrepreneurship and scientific solutions

30341 :  now in an urban environment thats extraordinarily difficult

30342 :  thats two days ago

30343 :  well theres two principle ways

30344 :  its invaded you

30345 :  if they mate successfully then no offspring

30346 :  and thats the nickname given to this disease

30347 :  it doesnt really matter

30348 :  you use chemicals

30349 :  we dont want to have a lasting impact on the environment

30350 :  it has to be safe

30351 :  its the same mosquito and its the same disease

30352 :  and the mosquito has killed more humans than wars and plague

30353 :  so weve done field trials now in the cayman islands a small one in malaysia and two more

30354 :  being infected every year

30355 :  of course i am

30356 :  its not very expensive because its a coffee cup something the size of a coffee cup will hold

30357 :  and im in favor actually

30358 :  we are going to use it in and around humans

30359 :  there were some allegations as well at the time the wives were treated as property the wives of the wealthy

30360 :  tokens could be exchanged for menial labor

30361 :  and this is very much part of the kind of utopian ethos to sail away

30362 :  and we have this setup

30363 :  plus its been shown that sixteen twentyfive of normal weight adults are

30364 :  so whats the problem then

30365 :  and with proteins it looks a lot better

30366 :  so what does this look like then

30367 :  theres two big reasons

30368 :  how does somebody eat this way

30369 :  it probably wont surprise you to hear that most of my patients have insulin resistance or

30370 :  two important things

30371 :  rule number two is

30372 :  i want you to go back and think about the last time you ate an american version of chinese

30373 :  one of the greatest joys of my job is to be able to tell a patient like this that they no longer have

30374 :  her diabetes was way out of control

30375 :  so it starts to rise

30376 :  can you still eat this way

30377 :  these guidelines then go on to say

30378 :  rule number one

30379 :  and its time we change that

30380 :  why is this not everywhere

30381 :  and eat when youre hungry dont eat when youre not no matter what the clock says

30382 :  if it says light low fat or fat free stays in grocery store

30383 :  dont be fooled theres a lot of money to be made from keeping you sick

30384 :  because they took the fat out they put carbs and chemicals in

30385 :  i am a great example

30386 :  we are in a diabetes epidemic now that we are spending two hundred and fifty billion a year on in this

30387 :  why isnt low carb the norm

30388 :  it is hard to break

30389 :  we can deliver these tools to peoples fingertips in the contexts that matter most

30390 :  youre not very good

30391 :  that in general you are exactly the same as each other

30392 :  every twentyone year old that i meet nowadays has got a one thousand friends and some of you old

30393 :  and not everybody has that permission or that privilege unfortunately

30394 :  at risd youre not allowed to draw from an image

30395 :  but in ninetysix i made my last piece

30396 :  now what does that mean

30397 :  every student knows what matters

30398 :  it changed its education policies and practice

30399 :  everybody says that

30400 :  you know poland hasnt changed its culture

30401 :  you wont believe it but there are countries in which the most attractive place to be is not the shopping center but the

30402 :  how do the media talk about schools and teachers

30403 :  people were stunned by the results

30404 :  and the most impressive outcomes of world class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system

30405 :  this is the blue bar which is driving costs down

30406 :  if we can help every child every teacher every school every principal every

30407 :  i know what its like to face redundancy

30408 :  and how can we do that together

30409 :  i am one of them

30410 :  for the markets to bounce back

30411 :  or running a marathon

30412 :  owning a sports car

30413 :  for people to live the life they want

30414 :  if over seventy percent of a countrys population under the age of thirtyfive is

30415 :  its time to give them some company

30416 :  but we also have to ask the question who is cultivating the economic soil of a country

30417 :  there is no incentive to improve the quality of your product

30418 :  incra would not only release its ratings but it would also release its indicators and

30419 :  the endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation to run the rating

30420 :  and that is the reason why i believe they should be defined as public goods

30421 :  i love to study these animals that break the rules because every time they break a rule they invent something new

30422 :  and we have them here today

30423 :  youre going to desiccate out there

30424 :  how narrow do you ask

30425 :  our borders are out of control

30426 :  now i was a refugee

30427 :  if you have met a refugee or a migrant in person that experience will inform your views

30428 :  now i dont get to talk about facts a lot so please indulge me

30429 :  lets have a look at some of the facts that are readily available to all of us right now as well as to journalists on our

30430 :  hundred thousand people died during the war in bosnia

30431 :  almost exactly five years later on a beautiful april day

30432 :  yes not all refugees and migrants are nice people its not a personality competition

30433 :  what are the things that were not talking about while we are focusing on these imaginary fears

30434 :  well this worries me because dehumanization is stage three of the eight stages of

30435 :  its the longest of this kind in the history of modern warfare

30436 :  so i decided to try something different

30437 :  and for once i agree

30438 :  this is an increase from two
30439 :  i loved being a radio journalist

30440 :  when we do that when we see migration as the fact of life

30441 :  but let me be a journalist for a second again

30442 :  the source of my hope are brilliant people i meet everyday refugees and migrants as well as

30443 :  we invite other powerful women to share their power and to support them and

30444 :  it is not racist to talk about immigration

30445 :  where does the energy come from

30446 :  you can influence your own technologies you have invented

30447 :  its very expensive

30448 :  i cant be dyslexic and stupid

30449 :  that means we have to take a second look at nuclear power

30450 :  we save nature by not using it by not needing it

30451 :  what about all the slums

30452 :  and thankfully scientists like dr

30453 :  so why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that

30454 :  and this is the biggest oxymoron we have in the society

30455 :  ignorance is the first enemy of the u

30456 :  and if you tell me that ignorance and the lack of education is not a problem

30457 :  we have three households that share the same garden space

30458 :  i let go with that mess

30459 :  because he is so successful

30460 :  so it really is great

30461 :  i suppose the funding bureaucrats ultimately have to get their act together

30462 :  we dont need any of that

30463 :  and then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta

30464 :  we had to get good quality images from which to make the cad model

30465 :  we now have a great clinical guidance out on the net

30466 :  and we had to get past the nice problem

30467 :  four and a half hours on the table and everything was done

30468 :  in the uk we have the national institute and clinical excellence

30469 :  and that means look far away

30470 :  we would like to know the fate of the universe

30471 :  is this interesting for you

30472 :  we used to be five thousand people

30473 :  he wanted to paint on the same walls we had been working so hard to try to get restored

30474 :  and people start sharing stories

30475 :  when we made the art project a success it was because we took time to talk with all the people and get the whole

30476 :  and we managed to collect materials from over forty buildings and incorporate them into the library

30477 :  and this has grown into the work that i do today called vard restored where we have over fifty
30478 :  because for example when were restoring homes the system is not about empowering people

30479 :  and were talking about the ability for each of us to develop as a human without that

30480 :  thats kind of strange

30481 :  so assuming that the person that wishes to know you are cannot watch the entire internet all at the same

30482 :  and the idea is to compartmentalize this because if you have to trust one agency to never betray you that means

30483 :  but as it just so happens the interesting notion here is this idea that somehow because you dont show it to someone

30484 :  but in some parts of the world this is extremely radical this notion that you have the right to speak freely that you do not have

30485 :  were talking about autonomy

30486 :  where surveillance is often in support of authoritarianism and specifically in support of violence

30487 :  sometimes it works quite well sometimes you just cant connect

30488 :  i come at this from the human rights perspective

30489 :  and what is that exactly

30490 :  in fact most of us probably already can tell that story

30491 :  so its nice because it can help dispel that notion

30492 :  and the technology was very fascinating to me

30493 :  i think a lot of people here understand this and yet europe has mandatory data retention not just for phone call related stuff

30494 :  because it dis empowers people who are otherwise totally literate

30495 :  but thats in the future

30496 :  in one thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven we saw the first heart transplantation first artificial heart came later

30497 :  but the problem was and alana will tell you is that theres scar tissue whenever you put anything

30498 :  she got a donor patella

30499 :  she had a piece of her hamstring fashioned into two ligaments

30500 :  so where did it all begin

30501 :  and if you ask her she will say she is extremely grateful for the fact that she can do all these things

30502 :  and so these kind of implants led to a lot of really interesting work with cells and with

30503 :  the body sort of treats it as an invader and begins to attack it

30504 :  we might be able to reduce the need for animal testing and reduce the need for human testing

30505 :  surgeons were able to rebuild her knee from a bunch of different sources

30506 :  ok so thats engineering healthy human tissues but what if we could engineer tissues that replicate a

30507 :  what can we do now

30508 :  she had two biopolymer ligaments and metal bumpers to hold everything together

30509 :  she can walk and now not only that i mean she plays basketball softball gymnastics you name it

30510 :  zero is going to be

30511 :  but imagine i mean getting back to the rat the rat is a whole organism and as

30512 :  and collaborators of ours at tufts are using models like these with tissue engineered bones to

30513 :  kevin eggan from harvard is doing just that taking cells from people who have the genes for

30514 :  bones you might imagine are mechanically active in a very different way and so when you look at bone tissue engineering you see a

30515 :  cutting others might make the bomb explore

30516 :  there are spots on the paper that are sticky

30517 :  and when it folds correctly these sticky bits end up on the inside

30518 :  we know how to do that so you can fake that

30519 :  what do you rock at

30520 :  what would they say about you

30521 :  are you really listening

30522 :  we all know how to show up well when we want to

30523 :  think about that

30524 :  zero how do you get to one
30525 :  because the act of writing your idea down is already a filter

30526 :  one key of creativity is to not lock on that first idea

30527 :  this is something youre thinking about ahead of time

30528 :  but is it creative

30529 :  and when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a european language

30530 :  science fiction is not so far from becoming science fact

30531 :  org and sign up

30532 :  what will be your role

30533 :  second we want to support young people who are beginning their careers and are interested in the

30534 :  our teacher taught us etiquette on how to ask someone to

30535 :  let life happen

30536 :  i was at university and anxiety was beginning to take a strong hold

30537 :  id submit to imperfection and i would face failure

30538 :  black and white thinking

30539 :  for example it becomes possible to simulate a procedure before actual

30540 :  you know the answer is i am still working on it

30541 :  because when you marry yourself this huge thing happens

30542 :  you become able to love in this whole new way

30543 :  he is a really good guy

30544 :  its a big idea

30545 :  thats my new job

30546 :  you become able to love other people right where they are for who they are the same way youre already

30547 :  we still have a wonderful relationship

30548 :  as i reflected on the date afterwards i was like wow i got really excited

30549 :  after the collapse of my third marriage in two thousand and five i realized that ive been marrying everyone in

30550 :  and at that time i didnt really know what was going on because i was really focused on sports

30551 :  and theres a lot of distractions around us all the time as we know

30552 :  so i was thinking of and creating within the same age range as most of you around one thousand five hundred and sixteen when i first started

30553 :  did you experience that at all

30554 :  is what im saying to myself in my head is it necessary in the exact moment in what im doing with my life right

30555 :  what was drawing me into this sound

30556 :  that perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an

30557 :  he came up with a name for his mystery agent

30558 :  they engage deeply

30559 :  that has failed

30560 :  their brain is on fire with yet

30561 :  when people come and tell me about the propaganda theyve heard about methamphetamine people who have clearly never tried the

30562 :  on the other hand its important to realize that if fifteen thirty of the users of psychoactive drugs

30563 :  the first is

30564 :  or across the country fiftyone million people

30565 :  now shes happy shes excelling at her school work and shes socially active

30566 :  when i talk about drugs and desire people make two assumptions

30567 :  cultural historian nancy campbell says that we tend to think of them as problem solving drugs and

30568 :  so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project

30569 :  thank you very much

30570 :  today i brought two recent projects as an example of this

30571 :  and they walk off

30572 :  we sign and theres all this hype leading up to our next record

30573 :  ive always been with my band or my crew

30574 :  is this what stupid people do

30575 :  thats when we discovered aquaponics

30576 :  its that question why and whats gone wrong

30577 :  with a truly outstanding one

30578 :  their mental and physical health improves and even their families are happier

30579 :  so essentially weve got an entire population of tired but

30580 :  not hormones social lives or snapchat

30581 :  i mean who wouldnt enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens and a little less

30582 :  this is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin

30583 :  only about one in ten gets the eight to ten hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep

30584 :  with advances in ancient dna technology we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those

30585 :  so the bacteria the fungi and so on and so forth

30586 :  if you would ask wether or not we would be able to revive an extinct species i would have said pipe dream

30587 :  well that is not actually the case

30588 :  and its probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that its not the time that matters its not

30589 :  and there they survived on the mainland until about ten thousand years ago and actually surprisingly on the small

30590 :  but weve come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate capture and discriminate the mammoth from the non

30591 :  if you would ask me ten years ago wether or not we would ever be able to actually sequence the genome of extinct animals i would have told you

30592 :  and this is not an uncommon feature in proboscideans because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will

30593 :  probably pleistocene overkill so the large game hunters that took them down

30594 :  so this landscape would be easily able to house it

30595 :  they bury their dead they educate the next of kin they have social knits that are very close

30596 :  and when i bring up this with my friends we often talk about

30597 :  well where would you put it

30598 :  it looks like they were interbreeding

30599 :  but what i have learned is something that is valuable for all of us regardless of the way we live our lives

30600 :  this would greatly reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and the environmental and economic costs

30601 :  but still from the background research i read in conversations i had with professionals working with similar

30602 :  if they had a system where they could collectively utilize solar and other renewable forms of energy and store it within

30603 :  but its also possible to use plant matter that we are already producing such as agricultural

30604 :  my work was of the concept called energy independence

30605 :  and a whopping eightyone of americans do according to the

30606 :  so i decided to put it to use by making it into a plant based fuel called biodiesel which can be

30607 :  there are a variety of free online tools that can help you gauge if your house and roof

30608 :  when we think about these next generation energy sources people often like to pit them against each other in a competition of

30609 :  these are called redox flow batteries

30610 :  wouldnt it be cool to be able to look inside the ankle to see where this restriction comes

30611 :  will you buy someone elses sample

30612 :  that grave dates to around four hundred and fifty ad

30613 :  is there any evidence of the sort of works they were doing in life

30614 :  and that is that they constantly promoted that each individual singer should understand the

30615 :  i then breathe deeply into my core which allows the air to come up fast and furious for maximum

30616 :  and many will say that the reason for the development of these vocal nodules is down to bad vocal

30617 :  and this is because the popularity of the castrato was so vast that every singer no matter if they were a non

30618 :  you dont have a work day anymore

30619 :  you have work moments

30620 :  theyre for interrupting people

30621 :  thats kind of bad

30622 :  why is that happening

30623 :  if youre interrupted and woken up you have to start again

30624 :  we probably went through it yesterday or the day before or the day before that

30625 :  you find a lot of other distractions but not managers and meetings

30626 :  i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business

30627 :  where do you go when you really need to get something done

30628 :  so if youre a manager start encouraging people to use more things like i

30629 :  and im one of these managers

30630 :  one is kind of a place or a location or a room

30631 :  thats kind of ridiculous

30632 :  its ten hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one hour meeting which probably should have been handled

30633 :  first thursday of the month just the afternoon nobody in the office can talk to each other

30634 :  i cant let someone work at home

30635 :  weve learned the same things around sexual interactions

30636 :  it can feel like we are all being blamed for the actions of a few

30637 :  and it may feel like saying nothing is playing it safe but saying nothing has its own consequences

30638 :  to understand the role that we can play in ending rape

30639 :  can you have so much to drink that youre no longer able to make an informed decision and no matter what you say that consent no longer is

30640 :  think about four women you know and love and think about one of them being sexually assaulted

30641 :  i want to talk about just four aspects of the rape culture

30642 :  now this can be hard for us as men to hear

30643 :  it impacts victims across identities

30644 :  first of all that message often says

30645 :  the difference between rape and sex is informed consent and informed consent is simply that every step of the way

30646 :  i hope youll join me

30647 :  of the college men who admitted to already having engaged in behaviors that met one of the ten behaviors that met the legal

30648 :  we also learned if youre unsure go really fast

30649 :  if someone says no or stop you dont have consent

30650 :  he went on to explain that optimism requires evidence of progress but hope requires no such evidence and is simply a

30651 :  thats why today i want to talk about sexual violence as a mens issue

30652 :  we can intervene long before those moments at the root causes of sexual violence that make those moments possible and

30653 :  and what if this didnt absolve them of any responsibility or accountability for their actions but meant that

30654 :  first the objectification of women

30655 :  as long as were only outraged at the rapists and their actions and avoid looking at the roots of sexual violence those roots

30656 :  what if you found out the next day that what you saw led to someone being sexually assaulted or raped

30657 :  when it comes to sexual violence i feel exactly the same way

30658 :  when we see someone whos not taking cues that someone isnt interested or when we see someone in a vulnerable position

30659 :  and we sometimes choose to view some women with less intelligence capability and humanity and that can lead to

30660 :  twenty years ago i heard cornell west speak about race and racism in this country

30661 :  we can intervene in the moment when we see two highly intoxicated people leaving together

30662 :  now can speaking up be awkward

30663 :  weve heard no means no and thats true

30664 :  he ended that talk then by saying he wasnt optimistic but he was hopeful

30665 :  if this helps you connect with this issue thats great but for me it sells us as men short

30666 :  i want a hole in the wall

30667 :  atlanta boston minneapolis places like that where this idea succeeds because it brings people

30668 :  well this idea is taking off in our peer cities like washinton d

30669 :  its the idea that i get all the benefit of the bicyle without any of the hassle of the ownership behind it

30670 :  its the idea that i dont necessarily want a hand drill

30671 :  the idea behind the library is something called collaborative consumption

30672 :  so my thought is why dont we take this idea and extend it to transportation

30673 :  after all i want to get somewhere

30674 :  and i let go of something inside of me and felt relieved

30675 :  where should i be rowing now

30676 :  she said that these were reminders of my strength and everything that i went through and nothing for me to be ashamed of

30677 :  its safe to say that we reimagined some traditions but we also kept some old ones that we worked in

30678 :  we were able to come back together to each other and recommit to ourselves to each other and to

30679 :  ive stripped away emotional support instead of facing my own vulnerabilities particularly around the heartbreaking

30680 :  had being transgender somehow precluded me from love and monogamy

30681 :  its reasoned justified and often signed into law

30682 :  but today im a man of my own intention a man of my own design

30683 :  what it means to be hard on the issues but soft on the person

30684 :  and i saw that i wasnt always the best listener and that my ego got in the way of our progress as a couple

30685 :  she has been my hero since day one

30686 :  weve learned how to love each other for the long haul

30687 :  so many of us have not received love from our families have been betrayed by the people that we

30688 :  sometimes as men we get to take the easy way out

30689 :  so often what were told is this idea of the golden rule that we should treat other people the way

30690 :  queer like a freedom too strange to be conquered

30691 :  about creating a manhood that isnt measured by the power it wields by the entitlements afforded to it

30692 :  we constantly experience this retelling of history where we are conspicuously left out

30693 :  ones that are about creating the space for us to be our authentic selves and not imposing this

30694 :  all of these animals are supremely adaptable theyre versatile theyre resilient they do

30695 :  it doesnt tell us that much about particular behaviors apart from the fact that an animal was

30696 :  and how cold the water is

30697 :  its paws are not well adapted to paddling

30698 :  ok so lets begin

30699 :  because if they had been successful at fishing they would only need one or two dives theyd dive in theyd catch a

30700 :  so on one hand that tells us that theyre very very well adapted to handling cold temperatures

30701 :  there are birds everywhere

30702 :  now the european environment agency estimates that the economic losses caused by

30703 :  our teachers our coaches our professors all show us something that we didnt know before

30704 :  and sitting next to you are your friends and your family

30705 :  he has run shuffled off his mortal coil run down the curtain and joined the bleeding choir

30706 :  death makes us so uncomfortable

30707 :  it s hard to choose those words just as its hard to say that my eight year old son

30708 :  if you hadnt nailed him to the perch hed be pushing up daisies

30709 :  oh let s go find him

30710 :  i truly believe that using a direct and respectful way of talking

30711 :  politicians use euphemism all the time to talk about things that they don t want to talk

30712 :  well wait a minute

30713 :  but sam didnt pass us by

30714 :  his metabolic processes are now history

30715 :  he is off the twig

30716 :  when we lost sammy

30717 :  can we facetime him

30718 :  com which has over six
30719 :  this should be a very useful reference for teaching a child about death right

30720 :  okay so can we talk to him

30721 :  we might say someone is let go when we mean fired

30722 :  and yet that is what i found myself faced with in two thousand and twelve when my

30723 :  dead is dead

30724 :  and when you hear a phrase like that you really begin to think about it

30725 :  we do spend an awful lot of our time trying to avoid it

30726 :  my phone died

30727 :  my phone is out of battery charge

30728 :  can we call him

30729 :  and im not trying to be harsh im really not

30730 :  it s not giving power to death to speak its name

30731 :  we must realize all living things have a purpose and that even though we may not understand that purpose

30732 :  her name was allie

30733 :  but at all times you are learning by doing

30734 :  that is done using a tecnology called ocr optical character recognition which takes a picture of text and tries to

30735 :  so i would like to translate all of the web or at least most of it into every major language

30736 :  scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book

30737 :  and would make more progress

30738 :  take for example how looking at simply someones race would give you an untrue view of who they are

30739 :  i ended up on a conservative website

30740 :  we all know you cant take the square root of a negative

30741 :  at the moment working in the latvian biomedical research and study centre we have managed to identify

30742 :  we lack this microbial diversity nowadays

30743 :  culture in business is the way people behave in your organization

30744 :  and the positive results of that period all those wonderful devices apple created stays with us as we speak

30745 :  nobody taught you how to pick the best person for the job

30746 :  in sports its not possible

30747 :  because anybody can see how good this guy is

30748 :  because i entered the most creative period of my life

30749 :  often a very theoretical one

30750 :  its not taking your team to the opera

30751 :  now for the american friends when i see football what i mean is soccer

30752 :  we act as if everybody delivers the same performance

30753 :  as ceo of the company he founded

30754 :  everybody in a sports team knows its about winning the game

30755 :  and how often do you do it

30756 :  its not about your performance its about their performance

30757 :  when weve given it all weve got we are as perfect as we can be

30758 :  because performance is highly visible

30759 :  and all of a sudden things fall in place

30760 :  its a nightmare

30761 :  it sounds impossible but in fact it was quite true

30762 :  i am going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it

30763 :  for the first time i could read what i wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner

30764 :  one is another american inventor ted henter

30765 :  there are other barriers brought about by our laws

30766 :  well because we cannot transport books across borders there had to be separate versions read in all the

30767 :  and his machine which was as big as washing machine was launched on the 13th of january

30768 :  i love stories i want to read

30769 :  i slowed it down for you

30770 :  i did not have to be nice to people

30771 :  websites are often very visual and there are all these sorts of graphs that are not labelled and buttons that are not labelled

30772 :  many websites we cannot read using jaws and the other technologies

30773 :  it had a speech synthesiser

30774 :  whether it be at the university of sidney law school where i served a term as dean or now as i

30775 :  can you play it that one

30776 :  and that is why next month in morocco a meeting is taking place between all the countries

30777 :  computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world but i think they have changed the lives of we

30778 :  i want that to happen

30779 :  it is something that a group of countries and the world blind union are advocating

30780 :  so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception we can transport

30781 :  now there are still barriers in front of people with disabilities
