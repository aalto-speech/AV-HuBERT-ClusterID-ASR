the first lesson is about humility
try it and let me know how it works for you
i even read many self help books
i would love to hear from you
it's about the data
that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake
we lost valuable data
but some of our grandchildren probably will
china is the world's greatest anti poverty program over the last three decades
how else can we create new ideas
we change the economics for the bad guys
so how does this work
did you hear he has gone mad
and i felt all this
it would start
it would skip a beat
so i learned never to move
it would stop
well that's what i thought
we know that we are right and they are wrong
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video for example your answer
we harbor bias
harness your internal strength
you might get impeached for that
there are no external cameras
this is not a photo profile for your facebook
and we connected over really small things like the fact that i love country music which is really
so i was jealous
i think i'm a normal person
i know i didn't
what are the researchers learning
they just do it
you don't get the same witnesses or depositions
i was petrified
and when she went to complain to a major he said what
sexual harassment doesn't discriminate
thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame
again in a car
not a lot of hands
i started off in uganda
what would that change about quality of life and nutrition
a digital world farm
i know platforms i know computers they put me on the internet when i was young
what would that change about how we live
why didn't you just tell me that
they have been sold by their families often to wealthy arab tourists
social change doesn't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation
but i grew up in canada far from my arab roots
this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region
this is the only part that's battery backed up
we're looking for something more
but in the process they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue
a couple of years ago a group of us in canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish
well we rejected all of that
what it looks like what it feels like and most of all what its core values are
progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage
so we locked ourselves in a room for two days and we tried to figure out what bound us together
so i want to talk to you today about what i think is a much more complete recipe for deep
especially when it comes to climate change
well very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days
this meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against crushing poverty widening
i take it to therapy
without it we literally can't interface with others
and it is important
my history wasn't right
my desire to disappear was still very powerful
i didn't talk to them
i actually have no idea why
go pick up the keys
now i will maintain
i think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
what difference does it make if they talk like jerry seinfeld
well why is that
well what difference does this make
so i went in that direction
that's next to impossible
sometimes it's messy and it's always unpredictable
how could i let them down
patriarchy is not boys and men
i've tried engaging people
so i'm going to say awesome stuff about myself
that allowed me to take a stand for myself
and he surprised me by saying you know what
and guess what silicon valley
i started to write about sharing the fact that i'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse including three
she wanted to change policy at the government level
some did not everybody
even that wasn't enough
but it wasn't just individuals
every kid lives near nature
there's pollination going on
and this is crazy
we've just somehow forgotten how to see it
they grow crops
like we evolved on this planet in the context of all the other animals with which we share
and i was like oh the amazon
i want to go
i just disagree with this
and so i think that nature is not that which is untouched by humanity man or woman
and i'm sure the figures are similar in other countries
there's people everywhere
and when we do the results will often surprise
we have to fix our education
you probably won't
most independent media was shut down
nor do i think we are by ourselves actually going to solve the problem
he's at a technology conference in florida
we have to fix the internet
it's not exactly rocket science
it's a pretty simple idea right
none of these studies found that people spend more on drinking or smoking or that people
it turns out the evidence says otherwise
and they don't need to ask for permission
they're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically
is it heavy
could i go there
we let other people worry about it
you can walk around them
you can experience their sense of place
who would i meet
where would it go
was the internet actually a place that you could visit
i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for
the whole internet
they had her scanned inside out
i'm a physician practicing with cutting edge technology
i would listen to the heart
i teach at stanford
we're losing a ritual
this is when i was in texas
well imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear
for hepatitis it was also two and a half times
children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation
what kind of trauma am i talking about here
for depression it was four and a half times
it was like a star trek episode you know
they want to know how often your dog gets outside
his name is lonnie hodge and he's a veteran of vietnam
she would hide in the closet
it cracked open my world
so they won't go for a walk they won't hang out with their friends they won't eat
they want to know how much exercise your dog is getting
and they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases
and they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants
we can't see it most of the time
actually studied hormones
everybody focuses on the things that kill us and that's what i was focusing on
we might say then well let's not worry about this
she contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work
what is that
i'm a professor and we're passionate about education
and imagine what might happen because every region has something to offer
why not ask all of the states to do that instead
my grandfather worked at this factory
my father worked at this factory he said
my mother was on the line to tell me that doctors had found a lump in his stomach terminal cancer
and i thought what am i thinking
it's not one way
he's five years old
i'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress
which brings me to my second point
can we really scale this up
pretty much everybody else who does polls
and i want to make the point that as members of society we need to
but you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet
but i don't
it comes out of a place called the gallup organization
my life really sucks
if you want this experience to live on as something historic then at the reception
so i'd like to leave you with these thoughts
there was no road map
the group gels
and he grew up essentially in stage one
what about martin luther king
life is great
in fact south africa has not gone down that road
i don't know anybody
and you don't leave them where they are
but we're not done yet
this is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen
you know they do polls right
all of you are members of tribes
you're hearing one presentation after another often representing a group of people a tribe about how
you don't want this
and they were basically having fun
it's very hard to make them part of our rational decision
we've known since we were babies
these guys could be true to their purpose which was finding oil and gas
we all know deep inside what the answer is
we need to be part of a community to survive
is it about systems
i looked at my friend who drilled seven dry wells writing off more than a billion dollars for the
i started looking at them really carefully
is it about equality
women's day was coming up
we created a diagnostic test
i am sick to my stomach
how do you know for sure
they dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong
the plane takes off
the engine fails
you board the plane
even if we get everybody working on it we've got to be strategic
sustainability has got to be a pre competitive issue
we're not going to be able to do that
there's no more of it
we paid two to three times more than anybody else
let's go back and visit our equation
so it's the demand that brings them to the table
how do you get informed
so we did the analysis again a slightly different way
and we finally figured out how to do it
in fact it's more like five percent
how far away was the finish line
i am fascinated by those times when people do not see eye to eye
so this is not the slogan from an inspirational poster
don't create solutions to impress customers
three billion people today with cell phones can't access the internet
they change from person to person
and in that i need a surgery lexicon
they have to be able to teach us something as well
you make it flow under and over
what do they have
the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place
do they have aids
do they have a common cold
so thank you for your attention
i'm not sure what it was
well once again women get the angiogram and nobody can tell that they have a problem
and we'd like to think it's not going to take thirtyfive years
and in fact it probably won't
they're often not recognized sent home
she had to impersonate a man
so we have these feast and famine cycles
so what do you think happens to these gals
and not enough is being done about this
women are worth it
mortality is not going down it's going up
we've done the research
it told us about hormone replacement therapy
the gas that they used at first in many cases was oxygen
so they added oxygen to methane gas
well you get several things
what is worth dying for
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise
thank you very much
and that's what we did
we hear the chaos of war
let's help them have a voice
young people as well
the silent majority does not need to be silent
we hear terrorism
so thank you very much
they don't have meaning
well guess what
now i know why i'm here
what if i had told her my story years ago
after all i was a bit unconventional
i've struggled to say those words because i didn't want to be defined by them
thank you very much
so bear with me
and the problem that we're solving is what are those things
they won the game
and that's actually what happened
but people did not relate to this
people started contributing ideas
i don't know
irreconcilable differences right
has it gotten better
something was wrong
that's something we ought to celebrate
they supported me all the way through it
we're blessed with people who listen to us
we don't use audio we don't use video
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really
it was appalling
we can't identify with that part
make it go away
make it go away
make it go away
that didn't happen to me
how is that possible
and the soldier on the front tank said we have unconditional orders to destroy this
i went to extreme lengths to try to be straight
but if you won't move we'll have no choice but to run you down
it's not a dirty word
the children were killed on the spot
and he's a bad guy
there were others like myself who were full time
one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people died
yes it's hard
gov just six people
they can't get what they need when they need it
that's the status quo today
what a contradiction
and in fact what did happen to my brain
i understand how this could happen
and so they took them to some safe place
i tried everything
maybe i did an experiment on myself without even knowing it
and that's even if you're working way more than full time hours
we don't even need that much time to do amazing things
that's like finding an extra hour in the day
but you can write it
well are you sure
so how do we do that
yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water all over her basement she found
you say you're working more than sixty hours
on the other hand statistics that's a subject that you could and should use
how are you
it's super real and it's happening around you
and i said that's a good job
this isn't information
but that's kind of a big problem
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
even when it's so hard
they get scared to walk around
my dad has alzheimer's disease
i'm trying to become a better person
they get scared to move
that's what happened with my dad
but the magnitude of the problem is something we need to appreciate
one billion people
i'm in tucson
i had to have faith
our city couldn't possibly handle any more cars
it would be a mall and not a park
well i didn't have any idea
we can do that because we know
but too often my treatments made them feel worse
i'm a doctor
you don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free
we're seeing the baby brain
they signed up because they wanted some form of revenge
the other was to be a baseball player
one was to be a soldier
i'm not a military brat
that's more expensive
this is a real mystery
but in fact they found something very surprising
but that really isn't true anymore
and the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you
we used to have a manufacturing economy which was about building goods and products and now we have a service
you would be issuing orders from above
one woman straps herself
one woman never did
one woman feeds on trash
rhythm is half silence
one woman gives birth to a baby
where do refugee hearts go
one woman gives birth to borders
my spine curves spiral
faced with absence
harvest contaminated tobacco
sickness health tender violence
one woman loses her head
cluster bombs left behind
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her
i see now i never was one and not the other
we mourn women complicated
i live cycles of light and darkness
i will craft my own drum
i will not be played
one woman shoots her face
so that's it for now
we can open up city hall
how do you change your behavior
he could come over and help me
so i'm in the media
we had the battle between jefferson and hamilton
or do you think the government should redistribute
and nothing happened at all
wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive
they don't represent what our views are
but that system has tons of problems
but that is not the case at all
this economy won't work and thomas jefferson saying the people won't trust that
getting a college education is a twenty year investment
when you grow up poor you want to be rich
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more
but i'm a big fan of you as a person
last week alone i got two hundred and thirtyeight pieces of nasty email and more
so what did they do
they met together
and not just that
why is it important now
that's my question
they have bad ideas
so people hear about this study and they're like great if i want to get better at my job i just need to upgrade my browser
i'm the opposite
then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are
they know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all
i would just give the inspiration and that's my job
i was not going to cry myself to sleep
i don't mean giving up the internet
which incidentally is only a third correct
this is your chance
but quite frankly on this issue there is no other road
let's think about your ethical footprint
how is it made
they feel at home
it's a fucking orgy
why was it made
let me illustrate this
what's this guy talking about
and then i thought there's got to be a better way
so what to do next
i want to be the center of attention
have inspired a generation of innovators
she never had to duck and cover under her desk at school
but before that cooperation could be realized kennedy was assassinated and that part of the
so it's really important that you know that right now we have over
but it's also an important date for another reason
we have no control over these forces
that is some deep deep emotion when you would want to do that
that's the work that stands before us
my research team and i went to west point military academy
i am torn by your love for me
i remember what you said to me
pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you
i am thinking of your love for me
and i said i don't know
remember what i said my love
it was the coldest i've ever been
i don't even know if it's a real job title to be honest
it's actually not that hard
raise your hands
that was powerful
you were born to
that's what we do
and to do so we've had to believe in impossible things
it really is quite phenomenal
it's been thought about for a while
why not just let businesses compete
we are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement
i have an idea for saving the world
we were so excited
we said yes
and so one of the major challenges of our project really is to find photographs that were taken before something
what's different is how the molecules are put together
the oil will never run out
but there's actually more to the story than that
i may never go to your house you may never come to my house
so they felt safe to come there
tell me about that
i said we work together
and work like a dog
and that's all
we didn't understand the program
that's your grandfather
they were all white
and is this really the solution
you can't run around in the dark
and it's not that they didn't want me to think critically
like why did i really have to mow the lawn
you can't hide behind anything other than your own teeth
is it that i write very well
do the same thing at work
and that's what i'm calling for here now
we almost don't feel ourselves
that robot put on a great show
we connect more and more
so what do we do
so you want to go to that board meeting but you only want to pay attention to the bits that interest
when this happens we're not able to appreciate who they are
so they don't have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them
thanks very much
we will not be there
i'll let you continue
thank you for your time
but it's not enough
i've built a career
it's a performance venue
and they're not just focused on money
we are magic
and so knowing that we went to the advertising council and we asked them to help us
but we were still missing a critical element
we met men where they were at and we built a program
we were obviously making a difference
and that's what we did
and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving
and let me just put this in context
take a look at one of our spots
why do i believe this
and you know what else we did
we were making what was invisible visible
and i have to tell you i'm passionate about data
make it about the other party
they're not donated
and use is what creates impact
they're not heavily subsidized
how does it happen
how cool is that
well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion
so was mother teresa
they will sit in them forever
so after twentyfive years i began to feel as though i was running dry
how much can we change
not a single one
so when we met chuck was a senior in high school
the question for us now is how much can we make of it
and that might have been the case
and that leads to a very powerful tool
how would i know what i was doing differently
i'm talking about teachers
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best
it's shocking to realize that only twentyeight percent of american
there's a flip side as well
we had law enforcement partners
they need support
i started to walk in the community and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't
i'm not strong enough to lift my carry on bag from the ground to the carousel
but it's more complicated
i'm twentyseven years old
thanks for asking
i said where is he now
sort of leadership by humiliation
and it doesn't
so naturally i asked what is african
give me input
this is completely bizarre
well that's what predictions are
so when you're born you can make feelings like calmness and
and so how does your brain give you that detail
i know i have
not what is it
they are the basis of every action that you take
predictions are the basis of every experience that you have
i'm totally serious
it's using past experience based on similar situations to try to make meaning
do that only if you're paid by the hour
that's a terrible waste of time
so that's mobile manipulation
what about manipulation
i love building robots
so it's up to us
that option is actually not on the table
and you walk around and it points to things
you just move away
it is the default option
you're more cautious
thank you very much
would you like to create a second one together
it's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
beth israel's in boston
i think this is a problem
and after that initial prototype we set out to make free and open source software so that others do not have
could we leverage the cloud
and then guess what
so why don't we leverage that
how much they do
you're in there
that's really important
but the second of the transformations the climate transformations we have to decide to do
it came from the way in which beijing has grown as a city
and we couldn't just turn it off
we can see how to do that
but you know what
but you know what
we all want to
i do believe we can fix what's broken
we had drawn a blank and it wasn't just iraq and afghanistan
we have ideas for how to make things better and i want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work
about a year after nine eleven researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the world
we could only think of one way
one you need to know where you are and exactly what time it is
it is my belief that to create these rare game changers requires you to pull off at least
we know why kids don't learn
one year i came up with a bright idea
i have looked at the best and i've looked at some of the worst
i'm so sorry
we can do this
you made it work for me
we were wrong
now that's a very very good point
human relationships are not efficient
that's available right now
efficiency is for robots
that was the only way to get anything done
art is not efficient
and when you think about it it makes a lot of sense because forming a question is a really complex
blocks have names
and that's pretty amazing
i mean that interface is beautiful
what we want what we aspire to is the code
we're going to stay with them forever
i was talking about interaction design
it's very hard to get of course
and that's really what i find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the
you know it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art
and does it matter
designers aspire to be really great designers
and others resented this comparison between gay rights and civil rights and
african americans supported it at a higher level than had ever been recorded
i couldn't tear myself away from the coverage
and this wasn't just an abstract question
here i'm one person talking to you
so what is an idea drawing
you're all collective
and if it's completely okay what's the joke
otherwise millions more will die
and we've all heard that kind of story before right
we're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
and so it's perfect for something like that
we need to see beyond the surface
you are a healer in a stone age village
but eventually they did come around
did you find the gold
at some point i'm going to get out
we really don't walk anymore
we'd love to help
when i get out of this am i going to be rejected
one way around this is to draw pictures
and this idea is actually nothing new
she was doing okay
seventy five percent of them are women and children
she got a support network
that was her fight
she learned about her rights
this fishing village was famous for sculpture
i had to do something
well we bought one of these
and i didn't expect that because i expected one of these
it's not a lot of money at the global level
i looked at slaves
there's no need to play the market
it had no choice
i realize of course that all countries are unique
just when that's the last thing you want to do
again it had no choice
that's nothing special
it's natural connective tissue
who cares about bosnia
i believe a story there has to be told
i have to report it
she worked in a bank
take my child
they don't get their money out
so let's watch what happens
are you losing your mind
the nazis invaded the netherlands
we are all responsible
you have to have a high tech experience of pregnancy otherwise something might go wrong
they want a treatment
what makes technology useful and usable
whatever it is about that person where they were born things like that
i can use it in my company
who's at the event
and when i was ten i didn't realize how amazing it was
i was able to do more things
plus we have stem cells
i know i was one of the first ten people to have this surgery
we just need to act on it
that even small scale farmers can leverage
the net outcome
china is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture and it has massive
it's about people
this is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else
and so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline
i will not forget the day we got that text message
i think it might be a lifeline
it's my dad
he told me not to tell anyone
texting has a one hundred percent open rate
that last one's an actual text message that we received
and so many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders
does any of this matter
and i thought we should just stay home
i feel that god knows me
the choices don't make sense because it's the wrong question
so we decided to go to the mosque
any spoken language that's used by real people has them
that's what texting is
casual speech is something quite different
it's a marker of empathy
texting has developed one from this slash
well that's exciting
it's the war on terror
come on man
it means for youth and it's a new arab tv channel
they have divergent values
but it's not about fire and brimstone either
they have different interests
and she's looking as young as ever
there is an animated series in the works
please look at me
he should not have been surprised
i want to warn you about what you're about to go through
he also had eleven children
not the wife not the kids
who is going to inherit his name and his fortune
why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting
we have problems that we desperately need to solve
i think we need something like a manhattan project on the topic of artificial intelligence
we don't need moore's law to continue
we just need to keep going
this is going to become really freaking obvious
i don't paint
you can navigate space
you know about numbers
that's not an improbable sample
of course they would
now don't get me wrong
we're on the grid
and he wanted one so badly
the science is there
i have resources
there won't be a single moment in the schedule
but it's different
it is wrong
it is irresponsible
this is not a put down of anyone
are we brave enough to welcome it
and here's what you need to know
your wife left you
it's the best way to shut people down on an airplane
he asked what do women need to do to conform to female norms
i study shame
i'm a fifth generation texan
i guess i'm doing it right now
she said yeah
what do you do
at what point did i think that was a good idea
have you lost your mind
why did you bring this up
i made a mistake
so what happens next
their parents are so poor they have no resources to get them back
if any child is found violating these rules he is severely reprimanded
effectively the taliban create a complete blackout of any other source of information
not right now
and this change is getting more rapid
there will be invisible capacity
but the question is who will have it
a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation for development
of course migration will become even more important
and they say i want to work in global poverty but what will it mean about my career
they want to be part of it
because we can
thank you very much
that is not simply critical to our economy
what can we do in all of this
roughly three hundred savings and loans involved roughly six hundred senior officials
in other words a coroner could find these things because this is a fatal recipe
and remember we had experience with this
what do we need to do
i imagine that my kids are going to live in a time when the most valuable commodities are fresh water
they make sense of the past
but i love it for a totally different reason
this is great
i love red wine
we've seen an image of our blue planet our world bank
i want to know how they impact me
so let's start there
supporting local economies
i want to know how i impact them
lots of money
i made more money
i'm going to be so healthy
it's a top predator
take a look at these
i don't know
but here's the thing
it's not like teaching them how to ride a bike
we have to answer that
the boys are up there for a year
what is it that he misses
it's not what i had expected
some of them got out of the army and had tremendous psychological problems when they got home
it was incredibly hot
that's what's so complicated about war
how does that work
i became a psychology researcher and i've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others
i'll meet you there
and i said to myself i wanna get me one of them
i tagged along with my neighbors
who wrote that
did you learn to wash your hands in school
why aren't people washing their hands
so why is it
did you learn to wash your hands at home
this is possible
the world's companies governments and non profits have delivery armies that are fully capable of covering this
they were wonderful people
as an inventor i try and turn fantasy into reality
no plankton means no fish
and then we were alarmed to discover something
not when you get lung cancer
it's an automatic process
it's an unconscious process
what kind of rituals are these
how could i come from a nation
the rituals were familiar
i was like what
i was going through a hard time as well
what about you
well there's a self fulfilling prophecy
we shouldn't be nationalistic
of those seven have nuclear weapons
but now it's turned around
but you know what the actual facts are
then they had to bring them in
i have to take a year off
surely we know enough
four times the mass of the sun
and germany and france
thank you very much
and i got pretty into it
do you remember what it was
this is how stuff is made memorable
the answer was no
when in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob
they also monitored the internet and social media to monitor the progress of
we're going down to the cellular level these days
of course we're going to go even deeper than the human body
think about that
terrorists are doing this
it's just a wall
i can stand up and do something
i have passion in my heart
imagine if we had across the country right now in local places but
let me tell you about a couple of them
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end
there were no back doors
what can i learn with you
at the same time
they are doing it together
we can create a global parliament of mayors
he wouldn't like the answer
the supreme court has fallen way down from what it used to be
that is the real world and unless we find a way to globalize democracy or
or any national leader
we are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together
they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites
i'm also on this mission because the way doctors practice medicine continues to
race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences
so what can we do
talk to farmers
only one percent of the people are actually farmers
well not so fast
and the way to do it is through the bloodstream
we weren't considered the real thing
so that was easy
we're always trying to make it faster
you need to be able to do something with it
i know you understand that
i'm in the crucible right now
it's so obvious
and they put on an opera all night long
that's what moves you
you don't question that
what is the abstraction
and that's a big deal for a profession that's in high demand
data drives better decisions
with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen
there's going to be a new system based on donated package tracking technology from the logistics company that i work for
it's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world
you see there's a lot of things we just don't have data on
but we're not there yet
it's a win all around
we go far beyond reasonable constructive criticism to dissecting any given woman's feminism
i learned to write like them and then i learned to write as myself
i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery
some boys broke me when i was so young i did not know what boys can do to break a girl
i'm a feminist but i'm a rather bad one
we have the right to respect
i want no part of any of that
i am full of contradictions
they are gorgeous and headstrong brilliant girls who are a whole lot of brave
i enjoy fashion magazines and pretty things
one of them got caught up in the water
you don't get a chance to mess it up
the economy needs them
so i started a research project with them
i wanted to get to know them as individuals
take a moment to say thank you
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education
who cleans up after us
i wanted to understand who takes the job
it brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion
they were right
and you know what
well not yet
but this is what i heard from a lot of outraged people
we have to decide what it means
there's a million different ways to eat pizza
we're not playing with each other
if we're still hungry we might have some more
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic
this is what i'm supposed to naturally be able to do
why is it not working
that didn't go over really well
so to summarize if we could offer a top quality education to everyone around the world for free
we don't have enough money
we can drive around
okay then we can make a mobile geiger counter
and we all know this
we can get volunteers
that may not always be the case
to me it's not that clear
but when i was little i remember he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun
so we need the solutions and these people playing the game they are trying out
it needs to happen
i mean everyone did
again it will not happen overnight
and they also knew that they can tap into a workforce
i tried everything
you're doing incredibly important work
so i looked for furniture
and i don't have to do anything
what makes the heart unique
and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive
it has never happened
i was a mediocre student
this is nonsense
i was the first non family investor in amazon
i am certainly not the hardest working
and i thought this would be great fun
i know nothing
i tried everything
and now i love languages
but i would go in on occasion
i was always very small
and this routine went on for some time
so i thought why not punish myself
most of my friends were taking japanese
and this became my holy grail my rosetta stone
so water was something that scared me to begin with
and that's bad
i'm not a social problem guy
it should be inspiring
it took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
i was considered a radical
so let's get started now
my other great passion is the environment
constance baker motley
some of them were really afraid of contagion and they wouldn't even walk in front of our
she never wanted to tell me
my parents came from germany
that is the right answer
so what was i going to do
but this is the source of innovation
and this leads to oddities
nobody comes to get famous
and it's hard and it takes courage but that's why we're alive right
it's kind of the anti reality tv
how are we going to do that
we push and pull and poke and prod things
we would just get noise back
how can we get so much information out of so little motion
and who does that benefit
and my whole world did open up
we now have a platform
the key here really is knowledge
we have to get quiet
you haven't earned it
how can we do it
storytelling is so important
stories are amazing
now in all seriousness movies are actually really important
what would happen
but what does
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place
just think about it
but it's a global phenomenon
i was winning awards
i was no longer homeless
i was living in my own apartment
i hadn't bathed in three days
i didn't always succeed
and i cried
why are you really here
and it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine
we know that every cell has a sex
she found us we found her disease
it showed no blockages
we have the tools but we lack the collective will and momentum
but for too many women that's not the case
but linda was lucky
the authors looked at papers written over a ten year period and hundreds had to be thrown out
i can hardly wait
how is that possible
five percent today
that's different from actually having an effective ad campaign
government officials are extremely mad
but those surveillance features come at a cost
don't get me wrong it's not like we don't have comedy in the middle east
it's more annoying
no not how much
why does a jellyfish emit light
it goes wrong
please sign here right now
or a firefly
and that's powerful
and guess what
i don't know about you
i exist because i have my women friends
i forgive you and i do not hate you
he got part time i
look at the end to see the animal
thank you very much
so i went to church as often as i could
does the water stay there forever
your job needs to be challenging
boy it matters a lot
so i'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone
you want to work for him
i feel guilty sometimes
he's a great guy
what do you mean
i needed an education
i'm not short
i was right there with you
that doesn't probably happen every day
now i'm ready for my interview
i don't look different
again let's just play
we must adopt that way of giving back
did i get my upgrade
what if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all
she got unlucky
that wasn't being asked
that would not work
now do something different
i did not know this
well i was surprised
how far do they reach
i mean how do they form
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother
why are we embedded in social networks
how do they operate
who or what inspires you and why
so the answer to the second question can we change
but one of the things i've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is
this is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have
allow many people to come in
when we share ideas we all get more
they want to get out
let us have a hong kong nearby
but now check out where they go on our tree of life
well i think about this all the time
they all look the same under a microscope i mean to a first approximation
it's just not possible
so i changed my immediate goal to ten thousand faces
how old are you
when you're six maybe you can do that
i didn't feel like i was in the wrong body
are they attractive
are they a potential mate
look at this pretty structure
has a coherent movement
brought in younger men
and i went back home and i said daddy i don't know who i am
and this is true
it's about proving who you are and what you can do
but there's so much potential
so since then i've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me
so we created a new school
and boy they were like what
but that doesn't mean that we can't
you just had to do things sometimes
how do you get to build those relationships
we can do it again
so i went to my doctor
but i'm not happy
it's not optional
they're not being shipped up here
it's not a luxury
we're going to eat these cows
indeed we run the risk of making things worse
don't we already know the consequences of a changing climate on our settled civilization
what is the exact relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and planetary
why do we need to study this anymore
imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics
he saw it written down somewhere
and now we want to do a double double of the age wave coming through
and looking at that pattern
that's sort of the state of the art
quite the opposite
and he thinks i'm saying take my picture
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one
which means take my camera
they haven't yet been convicted of a crime
so when i started my job at the arnold foundation i came back to looking at a lot of these questions and i came back
it impacts crime and violence
and at the other end of the spectrum we're doing an equally terrible job
they're like the baseball scouts twenty years ago
it worked for the oakland a's and it worked in the state of new jersey
they're just waiting for their day in court
and when i look at the criminal justice system in the united states today i feel the exact same way that i did about the state of
and sixtyseven percent of people come back
it impacts everything
but when you start to look at the data which by the way the judges don't have when we start to look at the data
it impacts sentencing
so i decided to focus on using data and analytics to help make the most critical decision
and when i talk to judges around the united states which i do all the time now they all say the same
we have no suspects
and all of this matters greatly because public safety to me is the most important function of
and they would take a yellow sticky and they would write something on it and they would put it up on a board
we took camden off the top of the list as the most dangerous city in america
now at that time camden new jersey was the most dangerous city in america
they were unbelievably expensive to administer they were time consuming they were limited to the local
some people call it data science
and one of them said we had a robbery two weeks ago
it turned out that we were doing a lot of low level drug cases on the streets just around the corner from our office in trenton
and i couldn't get this information out
i ran the camden police department because of that
we have no suspects
you just have to find another term and look that up
i do like magic
it's always what it was and what it can be
it's not true
the board of ed
they don't trust the law
had no idea
it's changed the way we talk
why don't they trust the law
and they did it in the good old fashioned way
first they founded political parties
now hamilton was everything madison was not
we can change our minds
because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group
growing up i was always intrigued by how people change
that's not to say it's impossible
but i found one
the irony is so obvious right
and i was really scared
here's where i stand
it wasn't who i was
i got about three thousand emails
my own website
they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters
it's a composite view that's constantly changing and being updated
we can see everything on wikipedia
we can create a decentralized database that has the same efficiency of a monopoly
you saw him act
how can somebody like that make you feel smart
he made me feel smart
i'm pushing and pulling with this object
it's just incredible
we only sell you airtime
it's right there for you to find
there's nothing underground about it
we have to throw it away
there's no structure
he wanted to keep score
when you really look at it how is it that young people spend most of their time using new technologies
but it's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write
you learn more about how computers work
i don't know
it was faulty and most of the time i had to restart it over and over before it worked
it is in the water
i had no idea what i was going to do if it didn't work
for africans homegrown science fiction can be a will to power
go i said again sweat forming on my brow
science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing
so that's what i'm doing
we're part of the same family
i have three sons so i see how they fight
and i won't name names but you know who you are
we're not just part of the same species
it's a debate about words about metaphors
we don't trust the man
what about polio
no one's ever said that before
let's have that
doesn't happen very much
i do understand it
it has to stop
you take them away disease comes back horrible diseases
i don't know
make me laugh
and all of that sounds great until you figure out where it's really going
but i need your help
you've broken your back
it's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away
well let's hold on to that thought for just a minute
it's letting stuff happen without thinking about it
what can i do about it
you'll never walk again
why did my child develop autism
i will be back
you don't do much editing
and that led me to this project
we have to turn that around
i don't have an answer
and that blew my mind
everything in the universe wears out
how frustrated are you right now
we take less notice of trivial matters
originally the sample was aged eighteen to ninetyfourhow sad are you right now
i don't understand
my brothers are not as interested as i am
he was also the first person to call me a feminist
and then at eleven o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues
you can try it
so just like with a bike we don't talk about it
we all know what he's talking about
and then something falls off the wall
that wasn't the case for me
dan replies so often you won't even notice it
no more charge before use
they had hit the jackpot
it wasn't like them to miss practice
life is good
one percent who get to do that
i didn't want to
the boys reminded me of home
after college i desperately needed to find a place to call home
i said in arabic
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust
let me give you a simple commercial example
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life
i don't have an overview
because it's given by other people
trust is the response
we suspended our values
and that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
but it's not just china
and what was the result of that
where are the philosophers
but this particular reality was not inevitable
that's the magic of the geological record
how do you find a dinosaur
but we only get one history and it's the one that we have
agreeable people are warm and friendly they're nice they're polite
they'll say i'm surrounded by a bunch of snakes and sharks
and he said well i just care so deeply about my customers that i would never sell them one of our crappy products
what are your intentions toward others
the answer to that question is a very definitive
whereas giving and taking are more of your inner motives what are your values
it's all about what can you do for me
i didn't know where i was
i would never want to do that
we need portable health benefits
how should we live
is it about earning as much as you possibly can
how should we work
we need to reinvent labor organizing
i don't care
i didn't know you actually have to have creative control
there's no other way
i mean i thought poetry was just self expression
so this is obvious right
so what's women's experience as it relates to mentoring
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance
that means at some point it's going to be your problem too
they were unexpected pleasures
or where does he live
they have social meaning
sometimes it goes further
strangers might ask each other for a sip of water
so no more missing guys
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children your coworkers your friends and
the question why does she stay
and here's where those guns come in
i had just graduated from harvard college
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car
i'm here to tell you the story of crazy love a psychological trap disguised as love one
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future
they're looking and looking and finding love
you remember carlos
out to dinner with family
but just imagine for a moment what this must feel like
and that's exactly what that is
but things have changed
he wanted to sit where he could scan the room where he could plan escape routes where he could get his hands
we do train them however to adjust caution according to where they are
we wouldn't tolerate that
you smell money
thank you very much
and how is that possible
and then what happens
often what happens is you're planning so hard for like how do i get through the hardest part
so momentum is good
how do i get through the hardest part
could we merge
we see it as a disruption of real life and important work
there's love and there's friendship and there's protection
when it's ten degrees below zero
we've all done this
she suffered so much
you destroy all the bone marrow in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy
which brought us to this
we've been working together since well since we were kids really
the same tool that united us to topple dictators
i was terrified
and i did not know what to say
they're not my children
and when we're unprepared we overreact
we can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate locate
but we all should
and in many cases we don't
this will pay dividends
that will change everything when we see that
why is that hard
he was smiling and we said go
and he said on the spot absolutely yes
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system
i could make that decision
thank you very much
that is great
that's awful right
and this is happening every day
and dance has progressed
we have the plan
that's pretty cool
but if they don't stay in paris the international pressure will be overwhelming
only we don't know that it's a homeless shelter
this is a really important chapter to me
i wanted to stay in this relationship
i went to the dean
why are we skipping over this
things were going well
i wasn't very good at reading things
buildings can be like people
their faces broadcast their experience
i know it works
